 Abstract  
Therapeutic inhibition of platelet activation is essential for the management of ischemic 
cardiovascular disease . The use of platelet adenosine diphosphate  (ADP) P2Y 12 receptor 
antagonists (clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor) in addition to aspirin are associated with a  
decrease in cardiovascular events in high -risk coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.  
Clopidogrel is the most broadly utilized P2Y 12 receptor antagonist . However, among clopidogrel 
treated patients , there is broad  variability in antiplatelet drug  response which is known carry 
prognostic implications. P olymorphisms of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 enzyme has been 
consistently shown to modulate clopidogrel response . Accordingly, the Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA ) has issued  a warning on the potential for reduced efficacy of clopidogrel 
among carriers of loss -of-function alleles (LOF) for CYP2C19 and suggest considering 
alternative antiplatelet therapies  for these individuals .   
The pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of prasugrel and ticagrelor are not  affected by 
CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms. However, to da te there are no head -to-head PD comparisons 
between these agents  among patients with different CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms which is 
currently under investigation in CAD patients undergoing PCI  at UF Health -Jacksonville (UFJ 
2014 -12, NCT 02065479) . In order to rule out play of chance findings, pharmacogenetic 
investigations require external validation cohorts to support the study findings. Therefore, the 
present study is designed to serve as an external validation cohort conducted in patients with 
established CAD not undergoing PCI  testing the non-inferiority in platelet reactivity of prasugrel 
versus ticagrelor among CYP2C19  LOF allele carriers .

 Background and Significance  
Therapeutic inhibition of platelet activation is essential for the managem ent of ischemic 
cardiovascular disease  [1,2] . In particular, t he use of platelet adenosine diphosphate  (ADP) 
P2Y 12 receptor antagonists (clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor) in addition to aspirin are 
associated with a  decrease in cardiovascular events in high -risk coronary artery disease (CAD) 
patients  [3-5]. Clopidogrel  is a second -generation thienopyridine  and inhibit s ADP -induced 
platelet activation  [1]. Clopidogrel is an inactive  form of  pro-drug requir ing a 2-step oxidation 
process  by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) system  to be in its  active form. Clopidogrel is the 
most broadly utilized P2Y 12 receptor antagonist , including in patients with acute coronary 
syndromes (ACS) and/or undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions  (PCI ) [6-8]. However, 
among clopidogrel treated patients , there is broad  variability i n antiplatelet drug  response and 
patients with poor clopidogrel response are at increased risk of thrombotic complications  [9-11]. 
Inter -individual v ariability in clopidogrel respon se is a multi -factorial  process , including clinical, 
cellular, and genetic factors  [9-11]. Among the latter , polymorphism s of the CYP2C19 enzyme  
has been consistently shown to modulate clopidogrel response [12-17].  
 Various  studies have demonstrated that carriers ( heterozygotes and homozygotes ) of 
loss-of-function (LOF) alleles have reduced clopidogrel metabolism leading to lower levels of its 
active metabolite and reduced  platelet inhibition  [12-17]. The most common LOF alleles include 
the CYP2C19 *2 and CYP2C19 *3 alleles which are found in approximately 15-40% of patients 
with a prevalence which may vary according to ethnicity ( about 15 % in Caucasians and 
Africans, and range between 30% and 40% in Asians ) [18-20]. Importantly , carriers of any LOF 
allele have an increased rate of cardiovascular adverse events, particularly in the setting of PCI  
Version 2

  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

 [12]. These observations have  led the  Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to issue  a warning 
on the potential for reduced efficacy of clopidogrel among CYP2C19 LOF carriers and suggest 
considering alternative antiplatelet therapies  for these individuals  [21]. 
The new -generation  ADP P2Y 12 receptor blockers, prasugrel and ticagrel or, have  more  
potent , prompt , and predictable antiplatelet effects compared with clopidogrel , which translate 
into greater reduction of cardiovascular events in ACS  patients  albeit at the expense of a higher  
risk of  bleeding  [4,5] . Importantly, t he pharmacodynamic (PD)  effects of both drugs have not 
shown to be affected by CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms  [22-25]. Moreover,  post-hoc analyses 
of two large, international trials have not shown any clinical interaction between CYP2C19 LOF 
polymorphisms and ticagrelor or prasugrel [26,27] . Although, PD investigations have shown 
equipoise between prasugrel and ticagrelor  [28], to date there are no head -to-head PD 
comparisons between these agents  among patients with CYP2C19 LOF alleles.   
Tailoring antiplatelet therapy according to results of genetic testing has been limited in 
real world clinical practice of patients by having readily accessible results of individual’s genetic 
makeup. Recently, a new rapid  genotyping assay for the CYP2C19 LOF polymorphisms, 
SpartanRX  (Spartan Bioscience, Ottawa, Canada ), has been developed  [29,30] . This technology  
is currently being testing in a prospective, randomized fashion the comparative PD effects of 
prasugrel vs . ticagrelor in CAD patients with CYP2C19 LOF alleles undergoing PCI  at UF 
Health -Jacksonville (UFJ  2014 -12, NCT 02065479) . In order to rule out play of chance findings, 
pharmacogenetic investigations require external validation cohorts to support the study findings  
[13,31 -33]. Therefore, in line with these recommendations, the present study is designed to serve 
as an external  validation cohort to UFJ 2014 -12 which is  testing the non-inferiority in platelet

 reactivity of prasugrel versus ticagrelor among CYP2C19  LOF allele carriers . This validation 
cohort will be composed of patients with established CAD not undergoing  PCI.   
 
Specific aim and study hypothesis  
The primary aim of the present study is t o compare the PD  effects of prasugrel and 
ticagrelor in patients with established  CAD (not in the setting of PCI) and CYP2C19 LOF 
alleles. This study will serve as an external validation cohort to UFJ 2014 -12 which is currently 
ongoing and assessing the same objective in the context of patients undergoing PCI . In 
particular, this will allow for a n external  validation  cohort composed of CAD patients with out 
the confounding factors related to the PCI procedure itself, including peri -procedural  intravenous 
antithrombotic therapy  as well the prothrombotic milieu generated by the coronary intervention . 
The study hypothesis is the non-inferiority in platelet reactivity at 24 hours of prasugrel versus 
ticagrelor among CYP2C19  LOF allele carriers.   
 
Research Design and Methods  
Study Population  
CYP2C19 genotyping is currently being performed in  patients undergoing cardiac 
catheterization as part of an implementation program at UF Health Jacksonville. This program 
has allowed for  the results of CYP2C19 genotyping  to be available in our electronic medical 
records (i.e., EPIC) providing the opportu nity to  clinicians to consider this information to aid 
their decision making on the choice of antiplatelet therapy to be used. Therefore, patients 
meeting study entry criteria will be identified from EPIC. These patients will be contacted by

 Blood sampling  
In patients meeting study e ntry criteria , blood sampling will be performed at 5 time points: 
a) baseline  (prior to loading dose administration of antiplatelet therapy); b) 30 minutes after 
loading dose administration; c) 2 hours after loading dose administration; d) 24 hours after loading 
dose administration  (before the morning dose of either prasugrel or ti cagrelor, in order to measure 
trough levels of platelet inhibition) ; e) after 10±3  days of maintenance dose antiplatelet therapy  
(blood will be drawn before the morning dose of either prasugrel or ticagrelor) .  
 
Platelet Function Assay : 
VerifyNow  Point -of-care Testing : The VerifyNow System is a turbid ometric based optical 
detection system which measures platelet induced aggregation as an increase in light 
transmittance (Accumetrics, San Diego, CA) and will be utilized according t o manufacturer’s 
instructions  [34,35] . The assay is based on microbead agglutin ation and uses specific reagents 
for the pathways of interest.  The instrument measures this change in optical signal and reports 
results in P2Y 12 Reaction Units (PRU). High on -treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) is defined by 
PRU >208  [36]. 
 
Study  Endpoint s and Determination of Sample Size : 
The primary endpoint is the non-inferiority in platelet reactivity, measured as PRU, at 24 
hours of prasugrel versus ticagrelor  among LOF allele carriers. Under the assumption of 0 
difference at 24 hours in mean PRU between ticagrelor and prasugrel and a common standard 
deviation of 50 PRU, a sample size of 22 patients per group allows for the 95% CI to stay within 
Version 2 
January 2 5, 201 8 
  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
10 
 ± 45 PRU with a  90% power and alpha  = 0.05. Considering the two arms of treatment and a 
possible drop out of 10 -15%, we will randomize a total 50 patients  to ensure that complete data 
will be available for analysis.  Secondary endpoints include: differences in PRU between 
prasugrel and ticagrelor at  30 minutes, 2 hours, and 10±3 days, and  rates of HPR at all study time 
points.   
 
Statistical Analysis : 
  The PD population will i nclude all patients with PD data and without a major protocol 
deviation thought to significantly affect PD profiles. All patients who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug w ill be  included in the safety population. Erroneously treated patients (e.g., those 
randomized to 1 treatment, but actually given the other) w ill be accounted for  on the basis of 
actual treatment received . All continuous variables  will be  expressed as mean values ± standard 
deviations.  Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. The SPSS 
software (ver. 21.0 for Window; SPSS, Chicago, IL ) will be used for all analyses.  An 
independent Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon rank -sum test  will be  used to compare continuous 
variables between groups . Comparisons between categorical variables will be performed using 
McNemar  test or binomial exact test. Missing data will not be imputed. A p values less than 0.05 
were considered statistically significant.  
 
Possible Discomforts and Risk  
The most important adverse effect associated with the use of prasugrel is bleeding  [5]. 
The risk of non -surgical bleeding is 2. 4%. The most common  side effects of prasugrel were 
Version 2 
January 2 5, 201 8 
  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
11 
 blurred vision, d izziness, headache, nervousness . The most important adverse effect associated 
with the use of ticagrelor is also bleeding [4]. The risk of non -surgical bleeding is 2.8%. Also, 
the most common clin ically side effects of ticagrelor were dyspnea (13.8%), headache (6.5%), 
cough (4.9%), dizziness (4.5%), and nausea (4.3%), principally. However, these rates are those 
reported after 1 year of treatment  with events that accrue over time , while this study i s limited to 
only 10±3 days of treatment thus reducing the risk of these events. All clinical events, if they 
were to occur, including myocardial infarctions both fatal and non -fatal, strokes, peripheral 
vascular disease, bypass surgery (coronary or peripheral vascular), repeated hospitalizations, and 
bleeding will be recorded. Clinica l events will be evaluated by a local committee, comprised of 2 
faculty members (2 cardiologists), not directly involved in the research. In the event of a report 
of a serious adverse event (major bleeding – defined as life -threatening: fatal, symptomatic 
intracranial hemorrhage, leading to a drop in hemoglobin of at least 5 g/dL, significant 
hypotension requiring intravenous inotropes, requiring surgical intervention, or requiring 
transfusion of 4 or more units of blood; non –life-threatening: substantially  disabling, intraocular 
bleeding leading to vision loss, or requiring at least 2 units of blood; thrombocytopenia <50,000) , 
the local committee will meet and antiplatelet treatment will be withdrawn.  
 
Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event is any un intended or undesirable experience that occurs during the 
course of the clinical investigation whether or not it is considered to be therapy related. This 
includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or 
frequency since the initiation of study treatment. Adverse events will be followed until resolution 
Version 2 
January 2 5, 201 8 
  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
12 
 while the patient remains on -study.  Once the patient is removed from study, events thought to be 
related to the study therapy will be followed until resolution or un til the patient starts a new 
treatment regimen.  
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE): An adverse event occurring while on study and considered 
related (reasonable possibility that the study treatment caused the adverse experience) to the 
study treatment that resu lts in any of the following outcomes:  
- Death  
 - A life -threatening adverse experience.  
- A persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly, or birth defect.  
- Requires inpatient hospitalization, or prolongation of existing hos pitalization.  
The definition of serious adverse event also includes ‘important medical event’. Medical 
and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and/or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. These should also usu ally be considered serious. Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allerg ic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasi a 
or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.

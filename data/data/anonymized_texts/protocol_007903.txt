Blood samples for PLN-74809 pharmacokinetics (PK) will be obtained 
before and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours postdose  on Day 1 (prior to 
administration of the PET ligand) and at 24 hours postdose (Day 2). 
Biomarker blood samples will be collected as per the Schedule of Assessments. 
Forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffuse capacity for carbon monoxide 
(DLco) will be performed on all participants at Screening for 
inclusion/exclusion purposes; a historical FVC and DLco within 1 month of 
screening may be used. For 
those participants whose travel to the study center 
would prohibit study participation, housing accommodation may be provided by the Sponsor. Except for the previously described periods, participants will be allowed to return to their homes between study visits. 
Duration of Participant Participation/Study 
Duration: Screening for all participants will be up to 35 days prior to dosing (dosing 
will be on Day 1). The Baseline Visit (including PET) will be performed on 
Day -7 to allow a washout of the PET ligand between PET procedures. 
Screening and Baseline visit may occur on the same day, if appropriate. 
Participants will receive PLN-74809 on Day 1 and will attend a Follow-Up 
Visit 7 days (±2 days) after administration of the single dose. For participants consenting to receive 2 different single doses of PLN-74809, at least 14 days

1 INTRODUCTION 
Pliant Therapeutics Inc is developing PLN-74809-000 (hereafter referred to as PLN-74809) 
for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common interstitial lung disease. IPF is a condition that is usually observed in the elderly and that is characterized by dyspnea and progressive loss of lung function leading to death, with median survival of 3.8 years after diagnosis based on 2014 data in the United States. The hallmark honeycomb appearance of IPF on high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) is the result of extensive fibrosis . 
Although not completely understood, IPF appears to be a response to alveolar epithelial injury with the resultant fibrosis mediated by growth factors  
 and propagated by myofibroblasts. As has also been indicated to be the case 
v integrins is central to the control of 
v6 v1 in 
PLN-74809. 
PLN- v6 v1 integrins (50% 
inhibitory concentration [IC 50] 5.7 nM and 3.4 nM, respectively). PLN-74809 reduced 
collagen synthesis in mice with bleomycin-induced lung injury, a commonly used 
experimental model for IPF . In ex vivo human IPF lung tissue 
(precision cut lung slices), treatment with PLN-74809 significantly decreased collagen 
type 11 (COL1A1) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels after a 3-day 
incubation period, providing an indication of antifibrotic activity in IPF. Mice completely 
def v6 function live a normal lifespan  suggesting that even 
full inhibition of such integrins is well tolerated. 
Integrins v6 and v1 mediate the release of activated transforming growth factor beta 
(TGF-)1, leading to binding of TGF- 1 to its receptor (TGF R)I/II and induction of 
SMAD2 and SMAD3 phosphorylation  
. Measurement of SMAD phosphorylation in lung lysates and in 
cells from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) has, therefore, been proposed to serve as a 
pharmacodyn v6 integrin engagement  
PLN-74809 treatment of mice exposed to bleomycin via oropharyngeal aspiration to induce lung injury and fibrosis was shown to inhibit phosphorylation of SMAD3 in lung tissue and in cells isolated from BALF, confirming PLN-74809-mediated inhibition of the release of 
activated TGF-
1 in the mouse lung. PLN-75068 (a tool compound with similar 
potency/integrin selectivity to PLN-74809) was also shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of 
SMAD2 in BALF cells isolated from the lungs of healthy cynomolgus monkeys. In both mouse and non-human primate studies, t
v6v1 integrin 
inhibitors correlated with reduced SMAD phosphorylation levels, demonstrating a clear pharmacokinetic (PK)/PD relationship. 
The present positron-emission tomography (PET) study described here is designed to address 
a relevant clinical question in participants with IPF. The dose- and exposure-response 
interaction of PLN-74809 with
v6 integrin will be investigated by performing PET imaging

with a competitive v6-binding probe at or near the maximum observed drug concentration 
(Cmax) of PLN-74809. Evaluation of PLN-74809 receptor occupancy of v6 will be analyzed 
v6-specific PET probe ([18F]FP-R 01-MG-F2; R 01), also known as the 
Knottin tracer. Previous work conducted in collaboration with Stanford Medical Center 
demonstrated the v6 
protein expression in the lung  The R 01 cystine knot peptide (FP-R 01-
MG-F2) is a 36-amino acid peptide which has been shown to bind selectively and 
specifically to v6, in vivo and in vitro, with nanomolar affinity  The 
18F radiotracer decays in the body with a short half-life of ~110 minutes (refer to the 
Radiology Manual for details about the Knottin tracer). Pliant has previously conducted 
studies in tissue and purified proteins demonstrating the ability of PLN-74809 to block the 
binding of a fluorescently tagged R 01 peptide to v6.  
The present study will characterize the effect of PLN- v6 receptor occupancy 
using PET imaging in participants with IPF. This study will also characterize the safety, 
tolerability, PK, and PD of PLN-74809 in participants with IPF.

Treatment wi
th another investigational drug, investigational device, or approved therapy for 
investigational use within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before anticipated 
dosing is prohibited apart from PLN-74809. 
Other medications to provide reasonable patient care of IPF or other comorbidities are 
allowed during the study; however, these should only be used if necessary because, at this stage of development, no formal drug-drug interaction studies with PLN-74809 have been performed.  
During screening, all medications, including over-the-counter medications and herbal 
supplements, taken during the 30 days prior to Screening will be recorded and reviewed by the Principal Investigator (PI) in consultation with the Medical Monitor to determine whether the participant is suitable for inclusion. For other concomitant medications that are needed during the study conduct, the PI should consult with the Medical Monitor as soon as feasible. 
If used, all concomitant medications, including both prescription and nonprescription drugs, 
should first be discussed with the PI and Medical Monitor before administration. This requirement does not apply in the case of urgent, necessary treatment of adverse events (AEs). In all cases, all medications, including over-the-counter medications and herbal supplements, that are taken by participants during the course of the study will be recorded using the generic name of the medication. In addition, for participants who are receiving nintedanib or pirfenidone, the time of drug administration should be collected on each day on 
which samples are obtained for assessing PLN-74809 PK. 
5.8 Restrictions 
5.8.1 Prior Therapy 
Previous use of IPF standard-of-care treatment (pirfenidone or nintedanib) is allowed for 
participation in this study. Prohibited medications (see Section 5.7, Concomitant Therapy) should be stopped at least 5 half-lives before dosing on Day 1. 
5.8.2 Fluid and Food Intake  
 
 
   
 
  
5.8.3 Participant Activity Restrictions 
Smoking of any kind is not permitted within 3 months of Screening or during the study.

o Oral hormonal contraceptives with less than 1 year of use in conjunction with condom 
 Sexual partner with surgical sterilization (e.g., vasectomy, tubal ligation, hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy).  
Females who are using hormonal contraceptives should have started use at least 12 weeks 
before Screening. 
Participants must agree to abstain from egg or sperm donation and to continue condom use 
through 30 or 90 days, respectively, after administration of the last dose of study drug. 
5.8.5 Diet and Other Restrictions 
There are no specific dietary restrictions.  Smoking and vaping are not permitted during the study. Use of recreational drugs and/or 
abuse of alcohol consumption are not permitted during the study.  
5.9 Treatment Compliance 
Dosing will be performed in the presence of site staff. Site staff will ensure the full dose

6 STUDY PROCEDURES 
6.1 Informed Consent 
An informed consent form (ICF) describing the study and all anticipated risks of 
participation will be prepared and submitted to the institutional review board (IRB) for approval. Written and dated informed consent will be obtained from each study participant prior to any study-related procedures being performed. 
6.2 Medical History 
Medical history will be reviewed and recorded at Screening. 6.3 Demographic Information 
Date of birth, sex, ethnicity, and race will be recorded at Screening. Body weight and height 
will be measured with the participant in light clothing. Weight will be recorded in kilograms and height will be recorded in centimeters.  
6.4 Physical Examination 
Complete and directed physical examinations will be performed at the time points specified 
in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1). Complete physical examinations include general appearance, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, dentition, thyroid, chest (heart, lungs), abdomen, skin, neurological, extremities, back, neck, musculoskeletal, and lymph nodes. Directed physical examination includes head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, 
musculoskeletal, and lymph nodes and any pertinent system based on any prior findings. 
Physical examinations may be performed at various unscheduled time points if deemed necessary by an Investigator. 
6.5 Vital Signs 
Blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded after participants have rested for at least 
3 minutes in a supine position. Ear temperature will be measured and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO
2) will be measured using a finger pulse oximeter.

6.7 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Participants will be in a seated or supine position during blood collection. Clinical laboratory 
tests will include hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis. Safety laboratory tests (hematology and clinical chemistry) will be collected from fasting (at least 2 hours) participants where appropriate.  
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed on all women at Baseline prior to the dose of study 
drug and, if positive, will be confirmed by a blood pregnancy test.  
A detailed list of laboratory tests is provided in Appendix 2 . 
6.8 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Plasma samples for PK analysis will be obtained before and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after 
dosing on Day 1 (prior to receiving the R
01 Knottin tracer) and at 24  hours after dosing (Day 
2). A collection window of ±5 minutes will be allowed for samples up to 1-hour post-dose and a collection window of ±10 minutes will be allowed for samples that are collected at 2 hours post-dose and after. Samples will be obtained and stored as detailed in the study PK Manual. 
The actual collection time of each sample must be recorded in the source data and on the 
eCRF. If the participant discontinues the study early, a plasma sample for PK should be taken at the Early Termination (ET) Visit if possible. 
Aliquots of these PK samples may be used to measure nintedanib and or pirfenidone 
concentrations in participants receiving these drugs.  
6.9 Pharmacodynamic Assessments 
6.9.1 PET Imaging 
All PET imaging will be performed at prespecified times according to the Schedule of Events 
(see Appendix 1), using the R
01 Knottin tracer as synthetized by the Radiology Department 
at Stanford Medical Center, and following predefined instructions as detailed in the study Radiology Manual.  
PET imaging that is performed following administration of PLN-74809 on Day 1 will be 
conducted as much as possible to coincide with PLN-74809 T
max (at least 4 hours post-dose 
v6 receptor 
occupancy. 
Blood samples for radiotracer PK will be obtained at the following time points: 1, 3, 5, 10, 
30, and 60 minutes after completion of radiotracer injection for PET-computed tomography (CT) to obtain blood time activity measurements. Each collection time point has a +4-minute window. During some PET-CT scans, sample collection may not be possible or may be obviated due to staffing availability or scientific considerations. Refer to the Radiology Manual for details, including definitive information regarding the allowed sample collection windows.

6.10 Adverse Events Assessments 
6.10.1 Timing 
In this study, AEs will be collected from the time the participant signs the ICF until the last 
study visit. 
6.10.2 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any event, side effect, or other untoward medical occurrence that occurs in 
conjunction with the use of a study drug in humans, whether or not considered to have a causal relationship to this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (that could include a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Events meeting the definition of an AE include:

Clinical Trial Protocol: PLN-74809-IPF-201, Version 6.0 Page 34
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may 
have been present prior to the start of the study. 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/serious adverse event [SAE]). Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include: 
- Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.  
- Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g., social and/or convenience admission to a hospital).  
- Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
 If there is evidence of an AE through report or observation, the Investigator or designee will evaluate further and record the following information:  
- Time of onset and resolution 
- Severity 
- Causality/relation to study treatment 
- Action taken regarding study drug 
- Outcome 
6.10.3 Severity of an Adverse Event 
Grading the severity of AEs will use the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) grading system (Version 5.0), as described below. The clinical significance of the AE is determined by the Investigator. The Investigator is encouraged to consult with the Medical Monitor.

Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL*. 
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self-care ADL**.

6.10.4 Causal Relationship of an Adverse Event 
The Investigator will assess the relationship between study drug and the occurrence of each 
e relationship of each AE to study drug will be 
recorded in the source documents and the eCRF. Alternative causes, such as medical history, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study drug should be considered and investigated, if appropriate. The relationship or association of the AE to a study drug (PLN-74809 or placebo) should be assessed using clinical judgment and the following considerations: 
No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiolog
y other than the study 
drug. For SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (e.g., preexisting condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication). 
Yes: A temporal relationship exists between the AE onset and administration 
clinical state or concomitant therapies. Furthermore, the AE appears with some degree of certainty to be related, based on the known therapeutic and pharmacologic actions or AE profile of the study drug. In case of cessation or reduction of the dose, the AE abates or resolves and reappears upon re-challenge.

PLN-74809  Pliant Therapeutics Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol: PLN-74809-IPF-201, Version 6.0 Page 36
The relationship to study procedures (such as venipuncture) should be assessed using the 
following considerations: 
No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study 
procedure 
Yes: The AE occurred as a result of protocol-mandated procedures. 
6.10.5 Outcome  
The outcome of an AE will be recorded on the AE eCRF as follows:  
 Recovered / Resolved 
 Recovering / Resolving 
 Recovered / Resolved with Sequelae 
 Not Recovered / Not Resolving 
 Fatal 
 Unknown 
 
6.10.6 Pregnancy 
A pregnancy is not an AE. If a female participant or the female partner of a male study 
participant becomes pregnant while enrolled in the study following administration of study drug or within 90 days after last dose, the Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator learning of the pregnancy.  The participant or the female partner of a male study participant will be followed through the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator is required to provide all the relevant information to the Sponsor using the Pregnancy Information Form to do so. 
6.10.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments  per se are not reported as AEs. However, those 
abnormal findings that are deemed clinically significant or that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE (or recorded as an SAE if they meet the criteria of being serious), as described in Section 6.10.2. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other abnormal findings that are detected after consent or that are present at Baseline and worsen after consent are included as AEs (and SAEs if serious). 
The Investigator should exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether 
an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Usually, the abnormality should be associated with a clinically evident sign or symptom, or

be likely to result in an evident sign or symptom in the near term, to be considered clinically 
significant. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality in the absence of clinical symptoms may jeopardize the participant and may require intervention to prevent immediate consequences. For example, a markedly low serum glucose concentration may not be accompanied by coma or convulsions, yet be of a magnitude to require glucose administration to prevent such sequelae. 
6.10.8 Serious Adverse Events 
6.10.8.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Is life-threatening 
 Results in death 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization (i.e., admission, overnight stay) or prolongs existing 
hospitalization 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
An AE is considered life-threatening if, in the opinion of either the Investigator or the Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
Important medical events that are not one of the above may be considered to be SAEs by the 
Investigator when, based upon appropriate medical judgement, they are considered to be clinically significant and may jeopardize the participant or when medical or surgical intervention may be required to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. (Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment at an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.) 
6.10.8.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
In order to meet the requirements for expedited reporting of SAEs meeting specific 
requirements to applicable regulatory authorities and IRBs, all SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours from the time site personnel first become aware of the event. This may be initially achieved by telephone or by completing an SAE report form and e-mailing it to the email address, as provided on the form.  
Initial notification of an SAE by telephone must be confirmed in writing 24 hours from the 
time the site investigational team first become aware of the event using the serious adverse event report form as described above. As further information regarding the SAE becomes available, such follow up information should be documented on a new SAE report form, marked as a follow-up report, and scanned and e-mailed to the address provided.

Withdrawal from the study in the event of a SAE and therapeutic measures taken shall be at 
the discretion of the Investigator. A full explanation for the discontinuation from the study should be made in the eCRF. 
The reporting of any SAEs to applicable regulatory authorities will be the responsibility of 
the Sponsor in compliance with applicable country regulations. All SAEs must be reported to the IRB by the Investigator in accordance with their regulations. 
6.11 Removal of Participants from the Study or Discontinuation of Study 
Drug 
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The Investigator or Sponsor may withdraw a participant from the study or discontinue study drug for any of the following reasons: 
 Noncompliance with protocol procedures, including those relating to administration of study drug. 
 A serious or intolerable adverse event occurs. 
 A clinically significant change in a laboratory parameter occurs. 
 The Sponsor or Investigator terminates the study. 
 The participant requests to be discontinued from the study. 
If a participant is withdrawn from the study or discontinues study drug, he or she will 
undergo ET assessments (refer to the Schedule of Evaluations in Appendix 1).  
6.12 Appropriateness of Measurements 
All PK, PD, and safety assessments are typical of those that are usually employed in studies 
aiming to establish a PK/PD relationship. When available, appropriate standard guidelines will be used.  
We 
v6 
integrin receptor can be measured utilizing PET probes in IPF patients. The evaluation of 
receptor occupancy of an investigational compound with PET imaging has been a well-established method in the study of neurological receptors for many years. We are applying both approaches to evaluate the PK/PD relationship of PLN-74809 in IPF patients. Assessment of the primary endpoint will be made using standard methods for quantifying the 
v6 integrin receptor in the lungs before and after 
administration of study drug. Standard mathematical and analytical tools will be used to determine if the presence of PLN-74809 reduces the binding of the PET tracer. Tracer uptake before and after treatment will be quantified to estimate changes in receptor density.

7 STUDY ACTIVITIES 
The Schedule of Events with study activities is provided in Appendix 1. 
When multiple study procedures are scheduled at the same time point, the suggested order of 
procedures is as follows but may be adjusted by the site staff to allow flexibility in the study flow:  obtain vital signs, collect urine sample, and collect blood sample. When 
several assessments are required at the same time point, evaluations should be completed so that the PK sample is collected at the required time.  
 
 
 When samples 
for PK purposes are scheduled for collection around a PET procedure, the PK samples should be obtained as close as possible to the prescheduled timing while minimizing interference with the PET procedure, which has priority.

8 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE 
During the study, the Sponsor and/or representatives of the Sponsor may visit the site to 
conduct an audit of the study. The purpose of this visit will be to determine 
to assessing the accuracy of the study data. Prior to initiating this audit, the Investigator will be contacted by the Sponsor to arrange a convenient time for this visit. The Investigator and staff are expected to cooperate with the auditors and allow access to all participant records supporting the eCRFs and other study-related documents. 
At some point during the development program for the study drug, a regulatory authority 
may visit the Investigator to conduct an inspection of the study and the site. The Investigator and staff are expected to cooperate with the inspectors and allow access to all source documents supporting the eCRFs and other study related documents. The Investigator must immediately notify the Sponsor when contacted by any regulatory authority for purposes of conducting an inspection.

9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 General Considerations 
This is an exploratory study; as such, no statistical hypotheses are being tested. In general, 
data will be summarized using statistical summary methods; graphic presentations of data may also be prepared. The contract research organization (CRO) will be responsible for the preparation of tables and listings and will assist in the preparation of figures, which may be done by Sponsor personnel. A statistical analysis plan (SAP), prepared and agreed before final database lock, will describe the analytic approach and methods in more detail. 
9.2 Determination of Sample Size 
The sample size has been set empirically. Up to 12 participants should provide proof of 
v6 receptor occupancy by 
PLN-74809). Pharmacodynamic, PK, and safety/tolerability evaluation of PLN-74809 will be 
assessed in the target population. 
9.3 Analysis Populations 
Safety Population:  All participants who receive one dose of study drug will be included in 
the Safety Population. PET Population: All participants with at least a baseline PET will be included in the PET 
Population. 
PK Concentration Population:  All participants who receive one dose of study drug and 
have any measurable PLN-74809 concentration data will be included in PK Concentration 
Population.  
PK Analysis Population:  All participants who have sufficient PLN-74809 concentration 
data for PK calculation will be included in the PK Analysis Population.  
 
 
 
9.4 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Plasma PLN-74809 concentrations at each sampling time point will be presented in listings 
and summarized with descriptive statistics. Plasma PLN-74809-versus-time profiles (with plasma concentrations on both a log and linear scale) will be plotted for each participant.  
Non-compartmental analysis will be used to calculate the PK parameters T
max, Cmax, area 
under the drug concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last measurable 
concentration (AUC last), AUC from time zero to 4 hours (AUC (0-4)) and from time zero to 
24 hours (AUC (0-24)) after dosing, and average drug concentration (C avg), if applicable. 
Plasma PK parameters will be presented in listings and summarized with descriptive

All AEs will be listed by participant and summarized in a table. The incidence of AEs, the 
incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), the incidence of treatment-related AEs, and the severity of AEs will be summarized by system organ class (SOC), preferred term, and maximum severity. In cases in which a participant reports multiple occurrences of the same event (preferred term), the greatest severity will be included in the summary. The number and percentage of participants with SAEs and treatment-related SAEs and the number and percentage of participants who withdraw due to an AE will be tabulated. 
Clinical laboratory test parameters will be listed, using the CTCAE grading scale, for 
individual participants, with values outside the reference ranges flagged. The incidence of treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities will be summarized by severity. Summary statistics will be calculated for each parameter. 
 
 
 
Vital sign measurements, other laboratory tests, concomitant medications, medical history and changes in physical examinations at each time point will be listed by participant. 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the most current World Health Organization 
(WHO) drug dictionary available.

10 ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS 
10.1 Institutional Review Board Approval 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to assure that all aspects of the study are conducted 
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki as described in the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and/or local laws, whichever provides the greatest level of protection for the study participants. The protocol and any information supplied to the participant to obtain informed consent, including written ICF(s), participant recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements), and written information to be provided to participants (information leaflets), must be reviewed and approved by a qualified IRB prior to enrollment of participants in the study. Prior to initiation of the study, the Sponsor must receive documentation of the IRB approval, which specifically identifies the study/protocol, and a list of the committee members. 
Amendments to the protocol and revisions to the informed consent must also be submitted to 
and, if required, approved by the IRB. 
The Investigator must submit progress reports to the IRB in accordance with the IRB 
requirements. Annual re-approval of the study must be obtained. Copies of progress reports and Annual re-approvals must be sent to the Sponsor. 
When the Sponsor provides the Investigator with a safety report, the Investigator must 
promptly forward a copy to the IRB. 
After completion or termination of the study, the Investigator must submit a final report to 
the IRB and to the Sponsor. 
The Investigator, as part of the records retention requirements for the study, must maintain 
documentation of all submissions, correspondence, and approvals to and from the IRB. 
Each clinical Investigator is responsible to conduct the study in accordance with the protocol, 
all applicable laws, regulations, and GCP according to ICH guidelines. 
10.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study

have direct access to participant records. Prior to the beginning of the study, the Investigator 
information to be provided to the participants. 
Before being enrolled in the clinical study, participants must consent to participate after the 
nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study have been explained in a form understandable to them. 
An ICF that includes both information about the study and the consent form will be prepared 
and given to the participant. This document will contain all the elements required by the ICH E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and any additional elements required by local regulations. The document must be in a language understandable to the participant and must specify who informed the participant. Where required by local law, the person who informs the participant must be a physician. 
A copy of the signed and dated consent document must be given to the participant. The 
original signed and dated consent document will be retained by the Investigator. 
The Investigator will not undertake any measures specifically required only for the clinical 
study until valid consent has been obtained. 
10.4 Participant Confidentiality 
Participant names will not be supplied to the Sponsor. Only the participant number will be 
recorded in the eCRF, and if the participant name appears on any other document (e.g., laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to the Sponsor. Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with local data protection laws. The participants will be informed that representatives of the Sponsor, IRB, or regulatory authorities may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, and that all personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance with local data protection laws. 
Applicable data privacy laws and regulations must be adhered to. The Investigator and the 
Sponsor are responsible for ensuring that sensitive information is handled in accordance with local requirements (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]). Appropriate consent and authorizations for use and disclosure and/or transfer (if applicable) of protected information must be obtained.

10.5 Study Monitoring 
study. Monitoring visits provide the Sponsor with the opportunity to: 
 Evaluate the progress of the study. 
 Verify the accuracy and completeness of eCRFs. 
 Ensure that all protocol requirements, applicable laws and/or regulations, and 
 
 Resolve any inconsistencies in the study records. 
The Investigator must allow the Study Monitors to periodically review, at mutually 
convenient times during the study and after the study has been completed, all eCRFs and office, hospital, and laboratory records that support the participation of each participant in the study. The eCRFs and other documentation supporting the study must be kept up to date by the Investigator and the research staff at the investigative site. These study materials must be available for review by the Study Monitor and/or other qualified representatives of the Sponsor at each monitoring visit. 
The Study Monitor will review the various records of the study (eCRFs, participant medical 
and laboratory records, and other pertinent data). The Study Monitor will verify the eCRF data against original source documentation for accuracy and completeness. The Study Monitor will identify data discrepancies and collaborate with the Investigator and research staff to resolve the discrepancies in a timely manner. Protocol deviations will also be 
identified and recorded on a Protocol Deviation Log and reviewed in accordance with the 
monitoring plan.  
10.6 Case Report Forms and Study Records 
The investigative site will use eCRFs to record all the protocol-specified data for each 
participant in this study. Entries made in the eCRF must be verifiable against source documents. Data reported in the eCRF that are derived from source documents should be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies should be explained. 
The Investigator will be responsible for reviewing all data and eCRF entries and will sign 
and correct. Queries generated by Data Management will be sent to the study site for resolution.  10.7 Protocol Violations/Deviations 
Participants must meet eligibility requirements to be enrolled in the study. Deviations must 
be reported to the IRB in accordance with the IRB requirements. During the course of the study, the monitor must notify the Sponsor of participants found not to have met eligibility

criteria. The Medical Monitor in collaboration with the Investigator will determine if the 
participant should be withdrawn from the study. 
10.8 Data Generation and Analysis 
Data management will be performed using eCRFs with data entry being performed by the 
research site staff into a validated clinical database. Laboratory data will be captured in a separate validated database.  
All data entry and verification will be performed in accordance with the standard operating 
procedures (SOP) of the CRO. 
10.9 Retention of Data 
The Investigator must ensure that all records pertaining to the conduct of the clinical study, 
ICFs, drug accountability records, source documents, and other study documentation are adequately maintained for a period of 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study drug. 
The Investigator must not destroy any records associated with the study without receiving 
approval from the Sponsor. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study records.  
Whenever possible, an original recording of an observation must be retained as the source 
document. However, a photocopy of a record is acceptable provided it is legible and is a 
verified copy of the original document. 
All eCRF data entered by the site (including audit trail), as well as computer hardware and 
software (for accessing the data), will be maintained or made available at the site in compliance with applicable record retention regulations. The CRO will retain the original eCRF data and audit trail. 
10.10 Publication and Disclosure Policy 
The data generated in this clinical study are the exclusive property of the Sponsor and are

of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Treatment Schedule: 
Screening Period 
Subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to dosing. After informed consent is obtained, 
information (including demographics, medical history and maternal-related information) from 
subjects will be collected, and subjects will undergo screening evaluations. Inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be reviewed to determine the subject’s eligibility at Screening.  
Inpatient Admission 
Eligible subjects will be admitted to inpatient unit on Day -1. Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
reviewed to confirm eligibility. Breast milk (non-PK samples) will be collected per subject’s 
pumping routine prior to first dose on Day 1. Subjects will remain in the inpatient unit for 5 
consecutive days; including the day of admission to inpatient unit (Day -1), 3 days of dosing 
SM (Day 1-3), and the day of discharge from inpatient unit (Day 4).  
Treatment Period 
Subjects will receive 600 mg SPN-812 in the morning on Days 1, 2, and 3 after the completion 
of safety assessments. On Day 2 and Day 3, SM will be administered at the same time in the 
morning (±30 min) relative to the time that SM administration occurred on Day 1. On Days 1-4, 
breast milk will be pumped/collected from each breast per the PK breast milk sampling schedule 
or subject’s pumping routine. For each breast milk collection period, the start and end times of 
the collection will be recorded, and the total volume (mL) of breast milk collected will be 
measured and recorded. 
Serial breast milk and blood samples will be collected on Day 3 to 4 for PK analysis. Breast 
milk samples collected out of the PK sampling period (non-PK breast milk sample) will not be 
analyzed for drug concentrations. The end of study (EOS) procedures will be conducted prior 
to discharge on Day 4 following the last breast milk and blood sample collection. If subject 
discontinues early, all EOS procedures will be conducted.   
Pharmacokinetic Sampling: 
Breast Milk:   
A total of 9 expressed breast milk samples will be collected on Day 3 at the following time 
intervals:   
Day 1: -4 to <0 hours pre-dose; 
Day 3: -4 to <0 hours pre-dose, and ‘0 to 4’, ‘4 to 6’, ‘6 to 8’, ‘8 to 10’, ‘10 to 12’, ‘12 to 16’ and 
‘16 to 24’ hours post-dose.  
Breast milk from each breast will be emptied as thoroughly as possible at each session using 
an electric breast pump at the planned time intervals. To ensure that the pump completely 
removes milk from the breasts, double pump for no less than 10 minutes until milk flow ceases. 
The length of each expressing session should be no longer than 30 minutes. 
Non-PK breast milk samples (not to be analyzed for drug concentrations but volume will be 
recorded) will be collected at the following time intervals:  
 Day -1: store milk as pumped per subject’s pumping routine 
 Day 1: 0 to 24 hours post-dose per subject’s pumping routine 
 Day 2: 0 to 20 hours post-dose per subject’s pumping routine

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any viewing or disclosure 
of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Blood:  
A total of 13 blood draws (4 mL each) for PK will be collected on Day 1 pre-dose, Day 3 pre-
dose, and Day 3 at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 16.0 and 24.0 hours post-dose. 
The following windows are permitted relative to the protocol-specified PK sample collection 
times:  
Pre-dose:  -15 minutes < 1 hour post-dose:   ± 3 minute 
1 to 8 hours post-dose:   ± 5 minutes 
> 8 to 24 hours post-dose:  ± 10 minutes 
Bioanalytical Methods    
Concentrations of viloxazine and 5-HVLX-gluc in plasma and breast milk will be determined 
using validated achiral chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry methods.  
Safety Monitoring: 
See Table 1 for safety monitoring procedures. Adverse event (AE) and concomitant medication 
monitoring will be performed throughout the study.  
Statistical Methods 
Analysis Populations 
 The Safety Population  will include all subjects who receive at least one dose of SM. 
 The PK Population  will include all subjects in the safety population who have a 
sufficient PK profile to derive at least 1 PK parameter without major events that could 
impact the PK data (e.g., emesis).  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
The PK Population will be used to generate breast milk and plasma PK parameters of viloxazine 
and 5-HVLX-gluc for all subjects.  
Descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation [SD], and coefficient of 
variation [CV], minimum, median, and maximum) will be used to summarize breast milk and 
plasma concentration data at each planned sampling time point for each analyte in breast milk 
and plasma. The midpoint time for breast milk expressions will be used as the milk sampling 
time. Breast milk and plasma PK parameters calculated from the concentrations and actual 
times will be summarized by analyte using descriptive statistics (including geometric mean and 
geometric CV). Individual and mean breast milk and plasma concentration-time profiles for 
viloxazine and 5-HVLX-gluc will be presented graphically on linear and semi-logarithmic scales. 
All PK parameters will be derived using a non-compartmental analysis method. 
Sample Size Determination 
The sample size selected is not based on statistical power considerations. Up to 15 healthy 
lactating women volunteers will be enrolled in the study, with the expectation that 12 subjects 
will complete the study. A sample size of 12 subjects is considered sufficient to achieve the 
primary objective of this study. 
Safety Analysis:  
AEs coded by system organ class and preferred term will be listed and summarized. Vital signs, 
ECG, C-SSRS, physical examination and clinical laboratory values will be summarized and 
listed with abnormal values flagged.

To distinguish between data in the public domain and that generated by Supernus, historical data 
will be associated with the term “viloxazine” and data generated by Supernus will be associated 
with the term “SPN-809V [IR], SPN-812, SPN-812 IR, or SPN-812 ER.   
1.1 Background 
SPN-812 (viloxazine extended-release capsules; QELBREE®) is a structurally distinct, bicyclic, 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. The active substance in SPN-812 is viloxazine, whose 
mechanism of action is multimodal with antagonistic activity observed at 5-HT2B and agonistic 
activity at 5-HT2C receptors, as well as weaker antagonistic effects at ADRα1B, ADRβ2 and 5-
HT7 receptors. Additionally, SPN-812 acts as a modulator with inhibitory effects at the 
norepinephrine reuptake transporter. Viloxazine was previously marketed in several European 
countries as an antidepressant as an immediate-release (IR) product. An extended-release (ER) 
formulation of viloxazine, SPN-812, has been developed by Supernus to prolong the release and 
absorption of viloxazine post-administration, thereby allowing longer dosing intervals for a drug 
with a relatively short half-life. As of April 2022, SPN-812 ( QELBREE PI ) is FDA-approved for the treatment of ADHD in persons 6 years of age and older based on clinical trials described below.   
1.2  Clinical Information 
Thirteen Phase 1 studies in adults, one Phase 2 and one Phase 3 studies in adults with ADHD, 
one Phase 2 in children with ADHD and four Phase 3 studies in children and adolescents with 
ADHD have been conducted with SPN-812. Data collection in two open-label extension studies 
evaluating long-term safety and efficacy of SPN-812 in ADHD patients, one inchildren and 
adolescents (6 to 17 years of age) with ADHD and one in adults (18-65 years of age) with ADHD, 
has concluded; final results are pending.  
1.2.1 Phase 1 Studies 
Phase 1 studies include comparison of various ER formulations to an equivalent daily dose of IR 
viloxazine (812P101), comparison of single- and two-bead SPN-812 ER formulations to an IR 
formulation at single and multiple doses (812P102 and 812P103, respectively), an evaluation of 
maximum tolerable doses in a single- and multiple-ascending dose study (812P120), as well as 
an evaluation of food and sprinkling effects (812P105) and alcohol (812P115). In addition, a 
[14C]-labelled oral solution was used to examine absorption, metabolism, and excretion 
(812P111). Drug-drug interaction of SPN-812 on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4 
isoenzymes was evaluated in study 812P113.1. Drug-drug interaction studies with stimulants 
were performed with d-amphetamine and methylphenidate in the 812P113.2 and 812P113.3 
studies, respectively. A study evaluating the DDI potential of paroxetine (strong inhibitor of 
CYP2D6) as a perpetrator of SPN-812 metabolism (812P113.4) was conducted. The effect of a 
multiple supratherapeutic dose of SPN-812 on QT interval has also been evaluated (812P117). 
Further, the effect of renal and hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SPN-812 has 
also been evaluated in 812P112.1 and 812P112.2, respectively. 
Results from these studies demonstrated that 200 mg single dose of an extended release SPN-
812 formulation resulted in a mean maximum plasma concentration (C max) of 1.33 µg/mL, area

for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC inf) of 27.3 hr*µg/mL, 
median time to maximum concentration (T max) of 5 hours, and a half-life of approximately 7 hours 
(812P103). Lower mean C max was observed for SPN-812 as compared to SPN-812 IR and by 48 
hours overall viloxazine exposure was comparable between the two formulations. The rate of 
absorption of viloxazine was formulation dependent; SPN-812 exhibited a slower absorption rate 
than SPN-812 IR. Following multiple-dose administration of SPN-812 on consecutive days, 
steady-state was achieved by the second day of multiple dosing. Little systemic accumulation of 
viloxazine was observed as no major increase in PK parameters was observed following multiple 
administration of SPN-812 compared to single dose administration, during the same time interval.  
Food and sprinkling did not affect the relative bioavailability of viloxazine following administration 
of SPN-812 capsules (812P105). SPN-812 interacted as a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2, a weak 
inhibitor of CYP2D6, a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4; and displayed no significant differences in 
metabolism within CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (812P113.1). 
There was no DDI between SPN-812 and d-amphetamine (812P113.2) nor between SPN-812 
and methylphenidate (812P113.3). There was no clinically relevant impact of paroxetine on SPN-
812 (812P113.4). In addition, there was no dose dumping observed with co-administration of 
alcohol with SPN-812 (812P115). Renal impairment resulted in a 1.09-fold, 1.3-fold, and 1.9-fold 
increase in AUC for mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment subjects receiving 400 mg SPN-
812 as compared to healthy subjects (812P112.1). Hepatic impairment (HI) resulted in 
approximately 21% increase and up to 6% decrease in AUC of viloxazine for mild and moderate 
HI subject receiving SPN-812 400mg compared to matched healthy subjects; severe HI subjects 
receiving 200mg of SPN-812 had a 25% increase in AUC of viloxazine compared to matched 
healthy subjects (812P112.2). Multiple doses of 1800 mg (supra-therapeutic) SPN-812 did not 
affect cardiac repolarization as measured by QTcI and QTcF or other electrocardiographic 
parameters (812P117). In the single ascending/multiple ascending dose study (812P120), SPN-
812 was well tolerated up to 2100 mg/day as a single dose and up to 1800 mg/day as multiple 
doses given once daily for 5 consecutive days. Intolerable adverse events (AEs) were not 
observed at doses of up to 1800 mg/day. SPN-812 at a single supratherapeutic dose had no 
effect on cardiac repolarization or other electrocardiographic parameters, other than slight 
increase in heart rate consistent with the known anticholinergic effect of viloxazine (812P120).  
In the human absorption, metabolism, and excretion study (812P111), absorption of the isomers, 
R- and S-viloxazine, was rapid with a median T max of 1.0 hour and showed a 2:1 concentration 
ratio, respectively. Nearly 100% of the radioactive dose was recovered with approximately 90% 
being recovered within 24 hours of administration, demonstrating complete absorption of the drug 
followed by rapid elimination. The primary circulating form was SPN-812; the only metabolite 
found above 10% total radioactivity was 5-hydroxyviloxazine-glucuronide (5-HVLX-gluc).   
The most common AEs in the Phase 1 studies in healthy adults were somnolence and headache. 
Most AEs were mild; none were severe or serious. No clinically significant, study medication-
related findings were observed for laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) tests in any study. In 
general, SPN-812 is considered to be well-tolerated with no safety events observed that would 
be unexpected for viloxazine.

Study 812P201, conducted in adults with ADHD using an earlier, IR formulation of viloxazine, was 
a randomized, blinded, proof-of-concept study. Subjects received either placebo or IR formulation 
of viloxazine three times a day in a dose range of 150 to 300 mg/day (26 subjects per treatment). 
The most common AEs the treatment group were nausea, decreased appetite, headache, and 
insomnia. No serious adverse events (SAEs) or deaths occurred during the study. 
In the Phase 2 dose finding study, 812P202, children 6-12 years old with ADHD were randomized 
in a 1:2:2:2:2 ratio to received placebo or 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg SPN-812 ER once daily for 
5-8 weeks (titration and 5 weeks of maintenance). SPN-812 ER at 200-400 mg was shown to be 
efficacious on the primary objective, reduction of ADHD-RS-IV Total Score. All doses of SPN-812 
were well tolerated with no serious or severe AEs. 
1.2.3 Phase 3 Studies 
Four pediatric pivotal Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 3-arm, 
parallel-group clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of SPN-812 for the treatment of 
ADHD in children and adolescents have been conducted, including two clinical trials in children 6 
to 11 years of age with ADHD (Studies 812P301 and 812P303; evaluated 100 mg, 200 mg, and 
400 mg) and two clinical trials in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with ADHD (Studies 812P302 
and 812P304; evaluated 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg). In April 2021, the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approved SPN-812 (Qelbree®; viloxazine extended-release capsules) 100-
400mg for the treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age. The most common 
adverse events (100-400mg) for were somnolence, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, insomnia, and irritability.  
A single pivotal Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 2-arm, 
parallel-group clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of SPN-812 (200-600mg) for the 
treatment of ADHD in adults 18 to 65 years of age with ADHD (Study 812P306) was also 
conducted. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to placebo or SPN-812 (200 to 600mg/day) 
for a total of 6 weeks of treatment. In total, 374 subjects were randomized and 372 subjects were 
treated: 183 subjects with placebo and 189 subjects with SPN-812. SPN-812 was well tolerated 
in all dose levels, with no deaths, and 2 SAEs were reported in 2 subjects receiving placebo 
(cardiac failure congestive and pancreatitis), and no SAE occurred in any subject receiving SPN-
812. No safety concerns were identified in this study. The most frequently reported treatment-
emergent adverse events (≥5%) were insomnia, nausea, dry mouth, constipation, headache, 
fatigue and decreased appetite. 
As of July 2022, data collection in two open-label extension studies evaluating the long-term 
safety and efficacy of SPN-812 has concluded, including one in children and adolescents (6 to 17 
years of age) with ADHD (Study 812P310) and one in adults (18 to 65 years of age) with ADHD 
(Study 812P311); final results for both are pending. 
Information and data from clinical studies are available in greater detail in the current SPN-812 
Investigator Brochure.

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is an open label, single treatment, lactation study of SPN-812 in healthy lactating women. 
The study is designed to assess the excretion of viloxazine and its major metabolite 5-HVLX-gluc 
into breast milk following repeated administration of SPN-812 600 mg, QD.  
This study is comprised of Screening, Inpatient Admission, Treatment Period and End of Study 
(EOS). The total duration of the study is up to 1 month including Screening up to 28 days and 4 
days of Treatment Period. Subjects will remain in the inpatient unit for 5 days, including the day 
of admission to the inpatient unit (Day -1), 3 days of dosing SM (Days 1-3), and the day of 
discharge (Day 4). 
Subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to dosing. After informed consent is obtained, 
information from subjects will be collected (including maternal-related information) and subjects 
will undergo screening evaluations (see Table 1). Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed to 
determine the subject’s eligibility at Screening. A lactation consultant will be available to provide 
lactation support to subjects once they are enrolled.  
Subjects will be admitted to inpatient unit on Day -1 to confirm eligibility. Subjects will receive 600 
mg SPN-812 on the morning of Days 1, 2 and 3 after completion of safety assessments. SM 
should be administered at the same time in the morning (±30 min) of dosing days. Breast milk 
and blood sample for PK analysis will then be collected on Day 3 per schedule in Section 7.2.1.1 
and Section 7.2.1.2 , respectively.  Non-PK breast milk expressed on Days -1, 1, and 2 will be 
collected over the time intervals in Section 7.2.1.1 , and these samples will not be analyzed for 
drug concentrations. The volume and the start and end times of the collection of each non-PK 
and PK breast milk sample will be recorded. The end of study (EOS) procedures will be conducted 
prior to discharge on Day 4 following the last breast milk and blood sample collection. If subject 
discontinues early, all EOS procedures will be conducted. Study schematic is shown in Figure 1, 
and Schedule of Events and Procedures is presented in Table 1.

3.2 Rationale of Study Design 
SPN-812, an extended-release oral capsule formulation of viloxazine, has been approved for the 
treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age. A Phase 3 clinical trial for the 
treatment of ADHD in adults has been completed and is under FDA review. Per FDA request, a 
post-marketing lactation study needs to be conducted “ in lactating women who have received 
therapeutic doses of viloxazine extended-release capsules to assess concentrations of viloxazine 
in breast milk” . This study will be conducted in healthy lactating women, and drug concentration 
in breast milk and estimated infant dose via breastfeeding will be assessed following the FDA 
guidance ( FDA guidance for clinical lactation studies, May 2019 ); the mother-infant pair will not 
be enrolled in this study, since there is no information available about the extent of drug transfer 
into breast milk, including evidence that the drug accumulates in breast milk and if the drug is 
likely to be absorbed by the breastfed infant. In this study, a multiple-dose design will be used 
since SPN-812 is administered chronically to treat patients with ADHD. The plasma steady-state 
will be reached after two days of once-daily administration without obvious accumulation 
(QELBREE PI ). In this study, the dose of SPN-812 will not be titrated up in incremental doses since a previous multiple ascending dose study of up to 2100 mg/day SPN-812 (812P120) has 
been conducted and no safety concerns were reported. The dose to be administered in the study, 
600 mg SPN-812 once daily, is the highest dose administered in pivotal Phase 3 studies 
conducted/completed in adolescents (812P304) and adults (812P306) with ADHD.

5.1 Study Medication Identity, Packaging, and Labeling 
Study medication, SPN-812 (QELBREE®, viloxazine extended-release capsule), will be provided 
at a strength of 200 mg. The 200 mg capsule is formulated to deliver viloxazine hydrochloride in 
the quantity of 200 mg viloxazine freebase.  
5.2 Treatment Assignment and Administration 
Each subject will receive 600 mg (3 x 200 mg) SPN-812 capsules. SM will be orally administered 
to subjects in the morning with water and with or without food. Subject will receive SPN-812 
capsules at approximately the same time each day (Day 1, 2, and 3).  
5.3 Blinding 
Not applicable as this is an open-label study. 
5.4 Study Medication Handling and Accountability 
All SM will be supplied to the Investigator by the Sponsor. SM supplies must be kept in an 
appropriate secure area (e.g., locked cabinet) and stored according to the conditions specified on 
the SM labels. Following Sponsor instructions and in compliance with ICH E6 as well as local, 
state, and federal regulations, the Investigator and study staff will be responsible for the 
accountability of all clinical supplies (receiving, shipment, dispensing, inventory, and record 
keeping) in a SM accountability log.  A copy will be collected by the Sponsor at the end of the 
study.  
Under no circumstances will the Investigator allow the SM to be used in a manner other than as 
directed by this protocol. Clinical supplies will not be dispensed to any individual who is not 
enrolled in the study. An accurate and timely record of the receipt of all clinical supplies; 
dispensing of SM to the subject; collection of unused supplies; and subsequent return of unused 
SM to the Sponsor must be maintained with dates. This SM accountability log includes, but may 
not be limited to: (a) documentation of receipt of clinical supplies, (b) SM inventory log, (c) SM 
accountability log, and (d) all shipping service receipts.  Forms may be provided by the Sponsor.   
Any comparable forms that the study site wishes to use must be approved by the Sponsor.  
The supplies and inventory records must be made available, upon request, for inspection by the 
designated representative of the Sponsor, or a representative of the FDA. The assigned CRA will 
review these documents along with all other study conduct documents at specified intervals once 
SM has been received by the study site.  All used, partly used, and unused clinical supplies, 
including empty containers, are to be returned to the Sponsor at the conclusion of the study, 
unless provision is made by the Sponsor for destruction of supplies and containers at the study 
site.   
5.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications

6.1.1 Screening Period (Study Days -28 to -1) 
Subjects will complete the screening visit, after informed consent is obtained, within 28 days prior 
to dose initiation. Since the mother’s infant cannot receive breast milk for 7 consecutive days (Day 
-1 to Day 6), the mother will be reminded at Screening to make plans to have their infant fed 7 
consecutive days with either (a) formula or (b) stored breast milk (e.g., breast milk pumped and 
stored in freezer during screening period between screening visit and day of admission to 
inpatient unit). 
6.1.2 Inpatient Admission (Study Day -1) 
Subjects will be admitted to the inpatient unit on Day -1 to confirm eligibility. A subject must meet 
all of the Inclusion Criteria and none of the Exclusion Criteria to remain eligible for enrollment in 
the study. Non-PK breast milk samples will be collected according to the schedule described in 
Section 7.2.1.1 . Subject will remain in the inpatient unit for 5 consecutive days, including day of 
admission to inpatient unit (Day -1), 3 days of dosing SM (Days 1 to 3) and day of discharge from 
inpatient unit (Day 4).  
6.1.3 Treatment Period (Study Days 1, 2, and 3) 
All eligible subjects will receive 600 mg SPN-812 on Days 1, 2, and 3. Subjects will remain in the 
inpatient unit during this time. The Treatment Period includes collections of blood and breast milk 
samples, according to the schedule described in Section 7.2.1.1 and Section 7.2.1.2 . 
6.1.4 Inpatient Discharge (Study Day 4); End of Study (EOS)/Early Termination (ET) 
EOS procedures will be completed and subject will be discharged from the inpatient unit on Day 
4, 24 hours after the final dose has been administered and the breast milk and plasma PK 
sampling is completed ( Section 6.2.4), or if the subject is discontinued during the inpatient before 
Day 4. 
6.1.5 Follow-up Phone Call (FPC) 
Subjects will be contacted via telephone 7 (± 2) days after discharge or final dose of SM for safety 
follow-up. 
6.1.6 Repeat Safety Assessments (Unscheduled Visits) 
At discretion of investigator, repeat assessments, including ECG, measure vital signs/weight, 
draw blood sample for hematology and/or serum chemistry and/or urine for urinalysis/drug screen, 
administer C-SSRS (Since Last Visit version), physical examination can be performed before, 
during and after inpatient study. AEs and concomitant medications should also be assessed at all 
unscheduled visits. The investigator should notify the medical monitor that they are planning to 
perform or have performed one of the above assessments again and provide the reason/rationale 
for repeating one of these assessments.

7.1 Baseline Characteristics 
The following demographic parameters will be captured: date of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity. 
The following will be assessed as related to the eligibility criteria as listed in  Section 4.2 and 
Section 4.3 and will include the following: 
 Medical History 
 Medication History (including all medications taken within 30 days before Screening) 
 History of drug, tobacco, and alcohol use 
7.2 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
7.2.1 Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection 
 Breast Milk   
A total of 9 expressed PK breast milk samples will be collected for PK analysis at the following 
time intervals:  
 Day 1: -4 to <0 hours pre-dose; 
 Day 3: -4 to <0 hours pre-dose, and ‘0 to 4’, ‘4 to 6’, ‘6 to 8’, ‘8 to 10’, ‘10 to 12’, ‘12 to 16’ 
 and ‘16 to 24’ hours post-dose.  
Breast milk from each breast will be emptied as thoroughly as possible at each session using an 
electric breast pump at the planned time intervals. To ensure that the pump completely removes 
milk from the breasts, double pump for no less than 10 minutes until milk flow ceases. The length 
of each expressing session should be no longer than 30 minutes.  
Non-PK breast milk samples (not to be analyzed for drug concentrations but volume will be 
recorded) will be collected at the following time intervals:  
 Day -1: store milk as pumped per subject’s pumping routine; 
 Day 1: 0 to 24 hours post-dose per subject’s pumping routine; 
 Day 2: 0 to 20 hours post-dose per subject’s pumping routine. 
The type of breast pump preferred will be determined on an individual basis. Those subjects with 
their own pumps and sterilizers will be permitted to continue using these. Subjects without their 
own pumps will be provided with a breast pump by the clinic. For each breast milk collection 
period, the start and end times of the collection will be recorded, and the total volume (mL) of 
breast milk collected will be measured and recorded. 
 Blood  
A total of 13 blood draws (4 mL each) for PK will be collected on Day 1 pre-dose, Day 3 pre-dose 
and Days 3 at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 16.0 and 24.0 hours post-dose. The 
following windows are permitted relative to the specified PK sample collection times:  
Pre-dose: - 15 minutes < 1 hour post-dose: ± 3 minutes 
1 to 8 hours post-dose: ± 5 minutes 
> 8 to 24 hours post-dose: ± 10 minutes

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any viewing or disclosure 
of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. All laboratory tests will be reviewed in a timely manner by qualified clinic personnel to ensure 
safety. Abnormal laboratory findings may be confirmed, if necessary, by one repeated testing at 
the discretion of the Investigator.  A laboratory abnormality may qualify as an AE (see Section 
7.4.7) if deemed so in the Investigator’s judgment. 
7.4.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs’ measurements, including orthostatic blood pressure, pulse rate, oral temperature and 
respiratory rate, will be obtained at times (+/- 15 minutes) designated in the Schedule of Events 
and Assessments ( Table 1). Orthostatic blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured after the 
subject has been seated for a minimum of 5 minutes and within 3 minutes of standing. Vital signs 
(resting or non-resting) may also be taken at any other time, as deemed necessary by the 
Principal/Site Investigator. 
7.4.3 Physical Examinations  
The physical examination conducted at Screening and EOS/ET will include assessments of head, 
eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, thyroid, neurological, lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, lymph 
nodes, and musculoskeletal. Measurement of height and weight will be performed at Screening.  
Any clinically significant findings during screening will be recorded as medical history and any 
clinically significant abnormal findings during treatment will be recorded as an AE. At the EOS 
physical examination, only changes from Baseline will be noted. 
7.4.4 Clinical Breast Examination  
The clinical breast examination conducted at Screening, Baseline (day of admission to inpatient 
unit prior to first dose), and at EOS/ET, is a physical examination of each breast, including visual 
inspection of the skin and nipples, and an assessment of the underarms and collarbone area. Any 
clinically significant findings during screening and/or baseline will be recorded as medical history 
and any clinically significant abnormal findings during or after treatment (after first dose of SM) 
will be recorded as an AE. Only changes from Baseline will be noted for the clinical breast 
examination at the EOS. 
7.4.5 Electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
A single 12-lead ECG will be obtained as per the Schedule of Events and Assessments ( Table 
1). Additional ECGs may be performed at other times if deemed necessary by the Principal/Site 
Investigator. 
The ECG will be recorded while the subject is resting in a supine position for at least 5 minutes. 
The ECG will electronically measure the PR, QRS, QT, RR, and QTc intervals, and heart rate. 
All ECG tracings will be reviewed within 24 hours by the Principal/Site Investigator or qualified 
Sub-Investigator. PR intervals will be determined for each of these ECGs from a single reading. 
Invalid measurements will be repeated. QTc will be reported as QTcF (QT corrected using 
Fridericia's method).

for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 7.4.6 Prospective Assessment of Suicidality via C-SSRS 
Suicidality assessment will be performed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-
SSRS), which will be administered by a trained professional during Screening , Day -1, and at End 
of Study. 
The C-SSRS is a questionnaire that prospectively assesses suicidal ideation and behavior using 
a semi-structured interview to probe subject’s responses ( Posner et al., 2011 ).  The C-SSRS 
versions applicable to the current study are the “ Baseline/Screening ” version ( Appendix 14.1.2.1 ) 
and the “ Since Last Visit ” version ( Appendix 14.1.2.2 ).  
 The Baseline/Screening version of the scale assesses suicidal ideation and behavior for 
lifetime and last 6 months. This version is suitable as part of a subject’s first interview and 
will be used at Screening to identify volunteers who must not participate in the trial due to 
their suicidal tendencies.   
 The Since Last Visit version of the scale assesses any suicidal thoughts or behaviors the 
subjects may have had since the last administration of the C-SSRS.   
 Training will be provided on the administration and interpretation of the C-SSRS. 
 C-SSRS findings 
Positive suicidality reports are generated for ANY of the following findings: 
 Suicidal ideation with intention to act 
 Suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent 
 Made suicide attempt 
 Interrupted suicide attempt 
 Aborted suicide attempt 
 Preparatory behaviors for making a suicide attempt 
Should the interview reveal that a subject has a positive suicidal ideation, the site staff should 
take appropriate steps to refer the subject to a psychiatrist for a follow-up evaluation.  The subject 
should not be released from the evaluation site until it is confirmed that the questionnaire answers 
are reviewed by the Principal/Site Investigator or designee and the subject is not considered to 
be at risk. Ultimately, the determination of suicidality and risk is up to the Principal/Site 
Investigator’s judgment.  
Any confirmed positive findings occurring after initiation of the SM dosing may qualify as 
treatment-emergent suicidality and should be recorded as an AE on the AE CRF. Positive suicidal 
findings recorded as an AE should be evaluated by the Principal/Site Investigator, in consultation 
with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee, as a potential important medical event ( Section 
7.4.7.3). If the suicidal indication has been determined to be an SAE, the subject must be 
immediately withdrawn from the study and the SAE must be reported to the Sponsor using the 
SAE Form (See Section 9.1 ).

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any viewing or disclosure 
of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 7.4.7 Adverse Event 
Subjects will be monitored throughout the study by Principal/Site Investigator for AEs. Adequate 
medical surveillance will be assured during the confinement period and a physician will be 
available on call at all times.  If necessary, a physician, either at the study site or in a nearby 
hospital, will administer treatment for any AEs. Subjects experiencing AEs will be re-evaluated for 
eligibility criteria to assess their continuation in the study. 
As defined by the ICH Guideline for GCP, an adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product 
and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with treatment. 
An AE can be: 
 Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether 
or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
 Any new disease, intercurrent injuries, or exacerbation of an existing disease. 
 Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG) that results in 
symptoms, a change in treatment or discontinuation from SM. 
 Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline. 
Surgical procedures are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that require 
surgery.  The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is detected during 
the study period. 
 Causality 
Adverse events may be categorized as either Adverse Drug Reactions or Suspected Adverse 
Drug Reactions based on their relationship to SM and the degree of certainty about causality.  
Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions  (SADRs) are a subset of adverse events for which there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the SM and the AE, i.e., there is a 
reasonable possibility that the SM caused the adverse event. 
Adverse Drug Reactions  (ADRs) are a subset of all SADRs for which there is reason to conclude 
that the SM caused the event. 
 Recording and Evaluation of Adverse Events 
All subjects who are enrolled and who receive SM will be monitored and questioned regarding 
the occurrence of AEs. Adverse events occurring prior to SM administration on Study Day 1 will 
become part of the subject’s medical history. Throughout the study, the Investigator must seek 
information on AEs by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  
Information on all AEs should be recorded immediately in the source document and also in the 
appropriate section of the case report form (CRF).  
All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be 
recorded in the source document, though they may be grouped under one diagnosis.  For

of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. example, fever, elevated WBC, cough, abnormal chest X-ray, etc., can all be reported as 
“pneumonia”. 
All AEs occurring after enrollment and receipt of SM and throughout the study period must be 
recorded.  A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE with a start date on 
or after the first dose of SM, or that worsened following first administration of SM, therefore, all 
AEs will be treatment-emergent.  The clinical course of each AE should be followed until resolution 
or until, in the medical judgment of the Investigator, the event has stabilized. Subjects that have 
experienced AE(s) may be re-evaluated for eligibility criteria to assess their continuation in the 
study as determined by the Investigator and the Sponsor. 
The Investigator is responsible for evaluating AEs and determining the following: 
 Severity: How pronounced is the incapacity/discomfort caused by an AE? 
 Causality: Was AE related or possibly related to the SM? 
 Serious vs. Non-serious: Is the event a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)? 
 Criteria for Assessing Severity 
The Investigator will evaluate the comments of the subject and the response to treatment in order 
that he or she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE.  Severity refers to the accumulated 
intensity of discomfort/impairment of health since the last recording of AEs and will be assessed 
according to the following criteria: 
 Mild:  Awareness of sign, symptom or event, but easily tolerated 
 Moderate: Discomfort enough to interfere with usual activity and may warrant intervention 
 Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly affects clinical 
status and warrants intervention 
 Criteria for Assessing Causality 
The Investigator is responsible for determining the relationship between the administration of SM 
and the occurrence of an AE as not suspected  or as a suspected reaction to SM.  These are 
defined as follows: 
Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the AE to SM administration makes a causal 
relationship unlikely , or other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide 
a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
 Not related:  Temporal relationship to SM administration is missing or implausible, or 
there is an evident other cause. 
 Unlikely related :  Temporal relationship to SM administration makes a causal relationship 
improbable; and other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible 
explanations.

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any viewing or disclosure 
of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the AE to SM administration makes a causal 
relationship possible , and other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions do 
not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
 Possibly related:  Temporal relationship to SM administration is plausible, but concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals could also explain event.  Information on medication 
withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  This will be reported as a Suspected Adverse 
Drug Reaction (SADR) . 
 Definitely related:  Temporal relationship to SM administration is plausible, and 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals cannot explain event.  The response to 
withdrawal of the medication (de-challenge) should be clinically plausible.  The event must 
be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re-challenge 
procedure if necessary.  This will be reported as an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) . 
 Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
AEs are classified as serious or non-serious.  An AE or adverse drug reaction  (ADR) is 
considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in one of the 
following outcomes:  
 death 
 life-threatening AE (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred. This does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or 
was allowed to continue, might have caused death.) 
 in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death 
or hospitalization but are clearly of major clinical significance.  They may jeopardize the subject 
and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. For 
example, drug dependence or abuse, blood dyscrasias, a seizure that did not result in in-patient  
hospitalization, or intensive treatment for allergic bronchospasm in an emergency department 
would typically be considered serious.  
7.5 Screening Scales and Assessment Tools 
7.5.1 Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)  
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a commonly used screening tool developed to assist in identifying possible symptoms of depression in women during pregnancy and during 
the postnatal period ( Cox et al., 1987 ; Wisner et al., 2002 ; see Appendix 14.1.1 ).  The EPDS is a 
10-item self-report questionnaire; items of the scale correspond to various clinical depression 
symptoms, such as guilt feeling, sleep disturbance, low energy, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation.  
The individual rates themselves on each item on a 4-point Likert (various response option

1, 2, and 4, the four response options are assigned a numeric value of 0-3 top to bottom. For 
items 3 and 5-10, the four response options are assigned a numeric value of 3-0 top to bottom. A 
total score is calculated by summating the ratings of all 10 items. The total score ranges between 
0 and 30, and a total score of >13 represents presence of depression. It takes approximately 3-5 
minutes to complete the EPDS.

All statistical analysis will be performed by CRO after the completion of the trial. A statistical 
analysis plan (SAP) will be written by CRO, reviewed, and approved by the Sponsor prior to 
database lock.  
Summaries for continuous variables will include the number of subjects, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Summaries for discrete variables will include the 
tabulation of frequencies and percentages, except zero (n=0) where percentages will not be 
displayed. All statistical analysis will be conducted by using SAS Version 9.4 or higher. 
8.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
8.1.1 Analysis Populations 
The Safety Population  will include all subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication. 
The PK Population  will include all subjects in the safety population who have a sufficient PK 
profile to derive at least 1 PK parameter without major events that could impact the PK data (e.g., 
emesis).  
For subjects experiencing emesis: 
PK parameters will be determined and listed for subjects experiencing emesis following the 
administration of SPN-812, however, parameters for these subjects may be excluded from the 
affected statistical analysis (i.e., descriptive statistics) per PK scientist’s discretion.  
Subjects experiencing emesis before study Day 3 may be invited to continue participation in the 
study if deemed appropriate by the Principal/Site Investigator. The accurate time of emesis should 
be recorded. 
8.1.2 Demographics/Baseline Analysis 
For continuous demographic variables, (age, height, weight, and BMI) results for each treatment 
administered will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  For categorical variables (ethnicity, 
race, and gender), the number and percentage of subjects will be used. All demographic 
characteristics will be listed by subject. 
 Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations (both site and individual) will be categorized and listed by subject. 
 Study Medication 
The dose administration details (including treatment received, date and time of dose, and dose 
level administered) will be listed by subject.  
 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior and/or concomitant medications will be monitored and coded using the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary and listed by subject. Concomitant medications will be further coded 
to the appropriate Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) code indicating therapeutic 
classification and a listing will be provided.

to receiving the first administration of the study treatment. 
8.1.3 Pharmacokinetics Analysis 
The PK Population as defined in Section 8.1.1  will be used to generate breast milk and plasma 
PK parameters of viloxazine and 5-HVLX-gluc for all subjects. Descriptive statistics (number of 
subjects, mean, standard deviation [SD], and coefficient of variation [CV], minimum, median, and 
maximum) will be used to summarize breast milk and plasma concentration data at each planned 
sampling time point for each analyte in breast milk and plasma. The midpoint of the breast milk 
collection interval will be used as the milk sampling time. Breast milk and plasma PK parameters 
calculated from the concentrations and actual times will be summarized by analyte using 
descriptive statistics (including geometric mean and geometric CV). Individual and mean breast 
milk and plasma concentration-time profiles for viloxazine and 5-HVLX-gluc will be presented 
graphically on linear and semi-logarithmic scales. All PK parameters will be derived using a non-
compartmental analysis method.  
 Pharmacokinetic Concentrations 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize evaluable breast milk and plasma concentration 
data at each planned sampling time point for each treatment. A listing of the actual sampling times 
and corresponding concentrations will be provided for all PK samples. Generally, concentrations 
below the lower limit of quantification (BLQ) will be treated as zero in the summary statistics for 
concentration data. However, if a BLQs value in the profile of Day 3 is between two quantifiable 
concentrations, then the BLQ value may be treated as missing at PK scientist’s discretion.   
Viloxazine and 5-HVLX-gluc mean breast milk and plasma concentration versus time profiles will 
be presented by using the scheduled sampling time on both linear and semi-logarithmic scales. 
Individual breast milk and plasma concentrations by actual sampling time will be provided on both 
linear and semi-logarithmic scales.  
 Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
Viloxazine and 5-HVLX-gluc PK parameters (see Section 7.2.3) will be calculated from breast 
milk and plasma concentration-time data by standard non-compartmental methods using 
Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (Version 8.0 or higher, Certara) and will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics. All individual subject parameter data will be listed. A list of PK parameters for plasma 
and breast milk are presented in Table 2. 
8.1.4 Efficacy Analysis 
There will be no efficacy analysis in this study. 
8.1.5 Safety Analysis 
Evaluation of safety will be performed on the safety population.  Safety analysis will include AEs, 
clinical laboratory tests’ results, vital signs, physical examination, C-SSRS, and ECGs. Safety and 
tolerability data will be reported using descriptive statistics. A complete description of the

SAP. 
 Adverse Events 
AEs will be classified into standardized medical terminology from the verbatim description 
(Investigator term) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will be 
presented by preferred term nested within System Organ Class.  All AE data listings will include 
the verbatim term and MedDRA Preferred Term. 
AEs are recorded only after SM has been administered; therefore, all AEs are treatment-
emergent. 
AEs will be summarized in tables. Listings of all AEs including deaths, SAEs, and AEs resulting 
in treatment discontinuation. 
 AEs will be summarized in tables. Listings of all AEs including deaths, SAEs, and  AEs leading 
to treatment discontinuation will be provided. 
 Laboratory Values 
Listings of all clinical laboratory results will be provided with the abnormal values flagged and the 
clinical significance assessment added, when appropriate.  Listings will include normal ranges.  
Descriptive statistics for each clinical laboratory test will be presented. Change from baseline to 
EOS will also be presented.  Laboratory test results will be assigned a low, normal, or high (LNH) 
classification according to whether the values were below (L), within (N), or above (H) the 
laboratory parameters’ reference ranges provided by the central laboratory.  For each laboratory 
parameter, shift from baseline to end of study visit will be presented in 3 by 3 tables based on 
LNH classification for each laboratory test, as applicable. 
 Vital Signs, Physical Examination, and Clinical Breast Examination 
Vital signs values and physical examination and clinical breast exam assessments will be 
evaluated on an individual basis, by subject, only for purposes of entry into the study and safety 
evaluation. Individual subject vital signs will be listed. For vital signs, both actual values and 
change from Screening values will be summarized.  
 ECG Results 
Subject tabular summaries of the quantitative ECG parameters and the overall ECG findings 
(normal, abnormal not clinically significant, or abnormal clinically significant) will be presented. 
QTc will be reported as QTcF (QTcF=QT corrected using Fridericia's method). For the quantitative 
ECG parameters, both actual values and change from Screening values will be summarized.  
Individual subject ECGs will be listed. 
 Prospective Suicidality Monitoring (C-SSRS) 
Suicidality monitoring data will be evaluated individually by subject and the C-SSRS findings will 
be presented in data listings.

9.1 Investigator Responsibilities for Reporting SAEs 
The Investigator must report all SAEs to Sponsor within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the 
SAE, regardless of whether the Investigator believes they are drug related. The Principal/Site 
Investigator must complete an SAE Form and include a detailed description of the SAE, as well 
as other available information pertinent to the case (e.g., hospital records, autopsy reports, and 
other relevant documents). The Principal/Site Investigator will keep a copy of this SAE Report 
Form on file at the study site. 
The Principal/Site Investigator, after thorough consideration of all facts that are available, must 
include an assessment of causality of the SAE to study medication.  
Follow-up information, or new information available after the initial report, should be actively 
sought and reported to the Sponsor as it becomes available using the SAE Report Form. 
Principal/Site Investigator must comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs to the IRB including submission of relevant safety information provided by the 
Sponsor.  
The Drug Safety Contact for SAE reporting is :  
PPD Medical Monitor 
Telephone (24 Hour): 1-888-483-7729  
Email: rtpsafety@ppd.com  
9.2 Other Events Requiring Immediate Reporting 
The Principal/Site Investigator must report a pregnancy  that occurs in a subject during a clinical 
study to the Sponsor Medical Monitor within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the event.  
Pregnancy should be reported on a Pregnancy Report Form. The Investigator must follow-up with 
any pregnant subject for 3 months after the child is born.  Any AEs concerning the pregnancy of 
the subject or the child after birth must be documented and reported to the Sponsor. 
In the case a subject has or manifested any clinical signs characteristic of a reportable disease 
or condition (e.g., tuberculosis, SARS), it is the responsibility of the Medical Director of CRO to 
notify the applicable Public Health authorities within 48 hours after becoming aware of the 
information. 
9.3 Sponsor Responsibilities for Expedited Reporting of SAEs 
The Sponsor will inform Principal/Site Investigator and regulatory authorities of adverse drug 
reaction (ADRs) that are both serious and unexpected, in compliance with applicable regulatory 
requirements, on an expedited basis (i.e., within specific timeframes). For this reason, it is 
imperative that study site submit SAE information to the Sponsor in the manner described above. 
Principal/Site Investigator must also submit the safety information provided by the Sponsor to the 
IRB/IEC unless the country legal regulation requires that the Sponsor should be responsible for 
the safety reporting to the IRB/IEC.

Investigator, in a written IND safety report, of any SADR that is both serious and unexpected, as 
per their applicable SAE reporting guidelines. The Sponsor will also notify Principal/Site 
Investigator of any findings from other sources (other studies, animal and in vitro testing, etc.) that 
suggest a significant risk for human subjects. Such findings will typically lead to safety-related 
changes in the study protocol, Informed Consent, and/or Investigator’s Brochure.

10.1 Adherence to the Protocol 
The Principal/Site Investigator agrees, when signing the protocol, to adhere to the instructions 
and procedures described within and to the principles of ICH GCP as well as all governing local 
regulations and principles for medical research. 
The Principal/Site Investigator and the Sponsor’s representative must sign the protocol and its 
amendments (if any) before initiating the study. 
The protocol, ICF, and appropriate related documents must be reviewed and approved by an IRB 
constituted and functioning in accordance with ICH E6 and any local regulations. Documentation 
of IRB compliance with the ICH and any local regulations regarding constitution and review 
conduct will be provided to the Sponsor. 
A signed letter of study approval from the IRB must be sent to the Principal/Site Investigator with 
a copy to the Sponsor prior to study start and the release of SM to the site by the Sponsor or its 
designee.  If the IRB decides to suspend or terminate the study, the Principal/Site Investigator will 
immediately send the notice of study suspension or termination by the IRB to the Sponsor. 
10.2 Changes to the Protocol 
Changes to the protocol will not be made without written approval from the Sponsor. 
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change that 
must be approved by the Sponsor before implementation.  Amendments specifically affecting the 
safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study require 
additional approval by the applicable IRB, and in some cases, filings to the regulatory authority.  
These requirements should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by the 
Investigator, or by the Sponsor, in the interest of preserving the safety of all subjects included in 
the study.  If an immediate change to the protocol is felt by the Investigator to be necessary for 
safety reasons, the Medical Monitor, and IRB must be notified promptly.  
Changes to the protocol which are administrative in nature do not require formal protocol 
amendments or IRB approval, but the IRB must be kept informed of such changes.  In these 
cases, the Sponsor or CRO will send a letter to the IRB detailing such changes. 
10.3 Protocol Deviations 
There are to be no Investigator-initiated deviations from the protocol. The date of and reason for 
deviations must be documented in all cases. Important deviations that significantly impact the 
completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a 
subject's rights, safety, or well-being must be reported by the Investigator to the IRB immediately. 
Reporting of all other protocol deviations must adhere to the requirements of the governing IRB.  
Changes to the procedures which may impact the quality of the PK data will be considered 
important deviations.  These changes will include any circumstances that will alter the evaluation 
of the PK.  Examples include, but may not be limited to:  
 Sample handling or processing errors that invalidate bioanalytical results  
 Inaccurate dosing on the day of PK sampling

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any viewing or disclosure 
of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  Such information may be used solely 
for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. In the case of an important deviation, collected blood samples will be analyzed. However, PK 
concentrations and PK parameters affected by the deviations (per PK scientist’s discretion) will 
be excluded from the study results.  
Other changes to the procedures which do not impact the quality of the PK data will not be 
considered important deviations.  If such changes occur, data will be included but the analysis 
will be adjusted accordingly. A common example of an unimportant deviation is a missed blood 
sample or deviations from blood collection times. Although these changes are  not significant, they 
are deviations from the protocol and should be documented in the clinical study report.  
10.4 Data Quality Assurance 
This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the protocol, standard 
operating procedures (SOPs), working practice documents, and applicable regulations and 
guidelines.  
10.4.1 Data Collection 
All clinical data will be recorded on site by the clinical staff on source documents and/or recorded 
electronically using validated software.  The Principal/Site Investigator and/or the site staff will 
assume the responsibility of ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the clinical data. 
10.4.2 Clinical Data Management 
The clinical database will be populated directly from electronic data as specified in the CRO’s 
data management plan.  However, recording of data may be done on raw data sheets (e.g., ECG 
data) and will be manually transcribed into the validated software. As a result, the CRFs will be 
populated directly from the validated software database and will be used solely for submission 
purposes.  Quality control and data validation procedures will be applied to ensure the validity 
and accuracy of the clinical database.   
10.4.3 Database Quality Assurance 
The clinical database will be reviewed and checked for omissions, apparent errors, and values 
requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures.  Data queries requiring 
clarification will be documented and returned to the investigational site for resolution. Only 
authorized personnel will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections will be 
documented in an audit trail.  All data will be verified for quality control and will also be subject to 
audits from CRO’s Quality Assurance Unit. 
10.4.4 Bioanalytical Sample Handling 
All collected PK breast milk and blood samples will be analyzed. Bioanalytical sample analyses 
for viloxazine and 5-HVLX-gluc will be performed at Supernus bioanalytical facility and/or a 
Supernus designated bioanalytical facility. Samples and Sample Inventory Forms/Manifests will 
be shipped to Supernus bioanalytical facility or the Supernus designated bioanalytical facility, 
according to instructions provided in a separate document. Primary and secondary (backup) 
samples will be transported in at least two separate shipments. The samples should be packed

included as appendices to the clinical study report.   
10.5 Retention of Records 
The Principal/Site Investigator has the responsibility to retain all study “essential documents”, as 
described in ICH E6.  Essential documents include but are not limited to the protocol, copies of 
paper CRFs, source documents, laboratory test results, SM inventory records, Investigator's 
Brochure, and regulatory agency registration documents (e.g., FDA form 1572, ICFs, and IRB/IEC 
correspondence). The Investigator should take measures to prevent accidental or premature 
destruction of these documents.  Study essential documents should be retained until at least two 
years after the last approval of a marketing application or after formal discontinuation of clinical 
development of the investigational product. These documents should be retained for a longer 
period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with 
the Sponsor. The Principal/Site Investigator must obtain written permission from the Sponsor prior 
to the destruction of any study document. 
It is requested that at the completion of the required retention period, or should the CRO relocate, 
the Sponsor should be contacted and give the option of permanently retaining the study records. 
These records must be made available at reasonable times for inspection and duplication, if 
required, by a properly authorized representative of the US FDA in accordance with the US 21 
CFR 312.68 or other national or foreign regulatory authorities in accordance with regulatory 
requirements. 
10.6 Auditing Procedures 
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, the Sponsor’s Corporate Quality Assurance 
department or qualified designee may conduct audits of clinical research activities in accordance 
with the Sponsor’s written SOPs to evaluate compliance with the principles of ICH GCP and all

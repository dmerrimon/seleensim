version of the protocol. The change of the name “amendment” to “amended protocol” is due to process change at the Sponsor com pany.
AMENDMENT 03 (07JUNE 2018 )
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union .
OVERA LL RA TIONA LE FOR THE AMENDMENT
In response to a BfArM (German y)request, the protocol was updated to add the rationale for the 
selected efpeglenatide doses and to add an appendix subsection related to acute kidney failure as a 
consequence of severe gastrointestinal ( GI)events and deh ydration .In response to a request from 
the health authorit y (HA ) in Poland ,monthly  home urine pregnancy  testshave been added.

update text with new available information (including statistical a nalysis update in response to 
an 
FDA request) , to align the procedures with those in other studies within the program and/or for 
better clarity .
Inconsistencies, t ypographical, and spelling errors throughout the document were also 
corrected.
Section # and 
NameDescription of Change Brief Rationale
Short title
Section 1.1 
SynopsisAdded study name ‘AMPLITUDE -M’ A name was selected for the program and was added 
to the study title .
Section 1.1 
Synopsis, 
Section 3 Objectives 
and EndpointsWording of tertiary objective (immunogenicity) 
and secondary objectives and corresponding 
endpoints of glycemic control, body weight, and 
safety are modified.Reworded for clarity, and to harmonize with th e other 
protocols in the program.
Secondary objective andcorresponding 
secondary endpoints which arenot part of 
multiplicity analysis are deleted from secondary 
and added under tertiary/explor atory endpoints.Only key efficacy endpoints included in the hierarchical 
testing and selected safety endpoints will be 
considered Secondary Endpoints ; all other swill be 
included in Tertiary/ exploratory endpoints.
Deletion of safety endpoints :laboratory 
variables, vital signs, and 12 -lead ECG .These are safety parameters assessed during the 
study and will be presented descriptively (detailed in 
SAP). At program level ,it was decided not to consider 
them endpoints.
Section 1.1 
Synopsis,
Sectio n 6 Study 
Interventions 
administeredAdded placebo toIMP dose schedule table. Placebo arm dosing was missing by mistake from the 
table .
Section 1.3 
Schedule of 
activitiesMinimum duration of screening (V1 to V2 and 
V2 to V3) has been clarified.To clarify the minimum period needed between 
screening and randomization to allow IMP supply 
(triggered by screening confirmation in IRS).
Added following text for pregnancy test: at on -
site visits and monthly at home in between 
visits.To add, at Polish HA request, monthly pregnancy tests 
to WOCBP included in the study.
Section 4.3 
Justification for doseModified and provided additional information for 
dose justifi cation.To clarify, at BfArM request, rationale for efpeglenatide
doses to be evaluated in the study.
Section 5.2 
Exclusion criteriaExclusion criteria E01 modified and added 
history of surgery affecting gastric emptying .
Exclusion criteria E15 modified and added 
‘clinical study involving any other type of 
medical research ’.
Exclusion criteria E16 updated to clarify the 
exclusion of participants with previous GLP -1RA 
intolerance.E01,E15, and E16 were amended to provide more 
details and clarify the patients’ eligibility criteria .

Section 5.2 
Exclusion criteria
Section 10.4 
Appendix 4 
Contraceptive 
guidance and 
collection of 
pregnancy 
informationExclusion criteria E19 deleted details of male 
contraception.
Deleted details of male contraception from 
Section 10.4 Appendix 4 .Efpeglenatide was not genotoxic, and a fertility and 
early embryonic development study in rats revealed no 
effect on male or female fertility and mating 
performance. 
Furthermore ,risk ofembryo- fetal toxicity in female 
partners of male subjects taking efpeglenatide (via 
seminal fluid )can be excluded .This is based on an 
exposure assessment performed according to 
methods prosed by Banholzer et al. (1)and an FDA 
guidance of 2015 (2)based on numerous parameters 
such as exp osure at no-observed -adverse -effect level
(NOAEL ) in embryo -fetal studies in 2 animal species 
(cumulated dose administered vaginally and resulting 
female exposure ).  
Using worst case assumptions for these factors, a 
safety margin of approximately 1800 between 
exposure at NOAEL in the most sensitive species and 
estimated exposure in females after contamination 
with efpeglenatide via seminal fluid was calculated. 
Therefore, use of condoms to avoid this contamination 
of female partners of male subjects taking 
efpeglenatide is considered as not required in clinical 
trials.
Section 6.3.2 
Randomization code 
breaking during the 
studyAdded following text, ‘When documenting the 
reason for unblinding, the Investigator must not 
provide any detail regarding the nature of the 
IMP. The Investigator should not divulge IMP 
detail to the Sponsor’s representative or to any 
staff members until database closure. 
Furthermore, when completing forms (eg, AE, 
SAE, adjudication information), the IMP should 
not be disclosed on the forms. ’Protocol updated to reflect the actual instructions 
provided to the sites to ensure blinding preservation at 
Sponsor/CRO team level, to allow an unbiased 
analysis of data.
Section 6.5 
Concomitant therapyAdded note for insulin use and also added 
DPP-4 inhibitors (eg, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, 
vildagliptin, or linagliptin), which are prohibited 
during the study.This information was omitted in error from previous 
version o f the protocol. DPP -4 inhibitors are not 
allowed to be taken during the study as this class is 
not approved for use in combination with a GLP1 RA. 
It was also clarified that short -time administration of 
prandial insulin (for acute illness, surgery etc) is 
allowed.
Recommendation for concomitant use of drugs 
with a narrow therapeutic window wasadded .To harmonize with the Investigator’s Brochure for 
efpeglenatide .
Section 8.2.4 
Clinical safety 
laboratory 
assessmentModified the text pertaining to local laboratory 
results which are used to make study treatment 
decision.Clarification of the local laboratory results that sites 
need to report in the eCRF to support medical 
evaluation of AEs.

Synopsis
Section 9.4.1 
Efficacy analysisUpdated the primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
method.Following FDA request, the statistical methodology of 
the primary efficacy end point has been updated .
Section 9.4.1 
Efficacy analysisAdded subgroup s of duration of diabetes 
(<10, ≥10years) and baseline estimated GFR 
categories (mL/min/1.73 m2): (<30; [30 -60]; >60) 
for assessment of treatment effect.
Prioritized order has been changed for 
hierarchical testing procedure of secondary 
endpoints.
Added following endpoint in hierarchical testing 
procedure ‘cha nge from baseline to Week 56 in 
body weight (kg) for efpeglenatide 2 mg versus 
placebo .’For project harmonization , subgroups for statistical 
analysis have been added .Also the order of the 
secondary endpoints in multiplicity assessment was 
changed, to pri oritize:  
 At Week 30, testing of body weight for 4mg 
dose before testing of FPG for 6mg dose 
and testing of  HbA1c <7% for 2mg dose 
before testing  of FPG for 4mg dose.
 At Week 56, testing of HbA1c < 7% for 6 mg 
dose before testing of body weight for 4mg 
dose .
Section 9.4.1 
Efficacy analysisAdded details of tertiary endpoint analysis under 
separate row .Updated to follow the change in endpoints explained 
above (moved from secondary to tertiary endpoints) .
Section 9.4.2 Safety 
analysisAdded the definition of 30 -week on -study 
period.
Specifications for hypoglycemia ha vebeen 
added in observation period of safety data .Following FDA request, the 30 week on study period

This study  is a Phase 3, multicenter, double -blind, placebo- controlled, randomized, 4- arm, parallel 
group stud y in participants with T2DM who have inadequate gl ycemic control with diet and 
exercise .
The randomization (1:1:1:1) to efpeglenatide 2 mg, efpeglenatide 4 mg, efpeglenatide 6 mg, or 
placebo will be stratified by  Screening hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ; <8%, ≥8%) and Visit 3 
(Baseline, Day  1) body  mass index (BMI ; <30 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/ m2).
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC ) will review clinical study  safet y data and 
an 
Independent Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC )will review, assess and/or adjudicate all events 
of death, selected cardiovascular adverse events (AEs),pancreati c events and other selected AEs 
(seeAppendix 1 [Section 10.1]for further details of study  committees).
Number of participants:
Sufficient participants will be screened to achieve 400 random ized participants assigned to stud y 
treatment for an estimated total of 100 participants per treatment group. All randomized 
participants will be included in the population analy zed for efficacy  endpoints. Section 9.2 gives 
details of the sample size determination.
Intervention groups and duration :
The study  will comprise 4 periods:
An up to 3- week Screening Period (with a minimum of 1 1days)
A 30 -week double -blind, placebo -controlled Core Treatment Period, for efficacy  and 
safet y assessment
A 26 -week double -blind, placebo -controlled 
Treatment Extension Period; participants will 
remain on the randomized investigational medicinal product (IMP ) regimen
A 6-week Follow -up Period to collect post -treatment safet y information for all participants 
after last dose of IMP
The maximum study  duration per participant will be 65 weeks.

Rescue therapy
Open -label rescue medication(s) to treat hy perglycemia will be at the discretion of the 
Investigator and in accordance with local standard of care and prescribing practice. Except for 
other glucagon- like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP -1RA)and dipeptidy l peptidase 4 (DPP -4) 
inhibitors
, any  approved medication(s) ,including oral antidiabetic drugs or insulin ,can be 
prescribed to treat the h yperglycemia. If a participant requires gl ycemic rescue, the IMP received 
during the randomized, double
-blind treatment period should continue and must remain blinded 
until the end of the study  (unless the Investigator considers a change necessary  for safet y reasons).
See Section 6.1.2.1 for full details of rescue therapy.

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly confidential Page 14Statistical considerations:
Primary analysis:
The primary  efficacy  endpoint (change from Baseline to Week 30 in HbA1c) will be anal yzed 
using HbA1c values at Baseline and Week 30 (observed or imputed), regardless of treatment 
discontinuation or initiation of rescue therap y. 
The prim ary anal ysis method for the primary  efficacy  endpoint will be an Analy sis of Covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with missing values imputed by multiple imputation (MI ) anal ysis methods in 
2 parts as follow s:
Missing endpoint data in participants who prematurely  discontinue the study  treatment 
before the Week 30 visit will be imputed using a model estimated from participan ts in the 
same treatment arm who prematurel y discontinue the study treatment before the Week 30 
visit but have the measurements for the endpoint (retrieved dropouts) . Considering that the 
number of 
participants in each treatment arm who discontinue the stu dy treatment but ha ve
the measurement for the endpoint is expected to be small, a simple imputation model will 
be used, where onl y the baseline measurements are included as the predictor. Each 
treatment group willhave their own imputation model. Missing data will be imputed using 
the regression method. 
Missing endpoint data in all participants, including those in the efpeglenatide arms, who 
stay on the study  treatment until the Week 30 visit will be imputed separately , using a 
model estimated from partici pants in the placebo group who stay  on the study  treatment 
until the endpoint visit and have the Week 30 data available. The imputation model will 
include the randomization strata and corresponding baseline values but without including 
any intermediate val ues. Missing data will be imputed using the regression method. 
In this analy sis, missing endpoint values will be imputed 10 000 times to generate 10 000 data 
setswith complete data. Each of the complete datasets after the imputation will be anal yzed by 
t
he ANCOVA model with the treatment groups (efpeglenatide 2, 4, or 6 mg, or placebo), 
randomization stratum of Screening HbA1c (<8%, ≥8%), randomization stratum of Visit 3 
(Baseline, Day  1) BM I (<30 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2) , and geographical region as fixed effects, and 
Baseline HbA1c value as a covariate. The Baseline value is defined as the last available value 
prior to the first dose administration of I MP or the last available value on or before the date of 
randomization if not treated with the double -blinded IMP. 
The r esults from the 10 000 anal yses will be combined using Rubin’s formula to provide the 
adjusted mean change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 30 (regardless of treatment 
discontinuation or initiation of rescue th erapy) for each treatment group, as well as the difference 
between each efpeglenatide dose and placebo and the 95% confidence interval (CI ) for the 
difference.
The number of retrieved dropouts 
is expect ed to be small, and may  not have sufficient data to 
support the imputation approach .If the re are less than 5 participants in an y arm who prematurel y 
discontinue the study  treatment before the Week 30 visit but have the measurement for the 
endpoint ,a back -up imputation method for the primary  efficacy  anal ysis will be used.

Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly confidential Page 15Inparticular, missing endpoint data in all participants in both efpeglenatide and placebo groups, 
regardless of stay ing on the study  treatment or not, will be imputed using a model esti mated from 
participants in the placebo group with endpoint data, where randomization strata and baseline 
HbA1c value are included as the predictors. Missing data will be imputed using the regression 
method.
Hierarchical procedure will be done to adjust for the multiplicity  of comparison. First, the highest 
dose of efpeglenatide (6 mg) will be compared to placebo. If the superiority  is demonstrated, the 
superiority  of 4 mg dose of efpeglenatide versus placebo will be tested. If demonstrated, the 
lowest dose (2 mg) will be tested. When the superiority  is not obtained in a step, the sequential 
testing procedure will be stopped.
Summary  statistics (for Screening value, Baseline value, observed values, and observed changes 
from Baseline) at scheduled visits will be provided for each treatment group over the whole 
treatment period including the 26 -week Safet y Extension Period. The summary  will include the 
number of observations, mean, standard deviation, standard err or (SE ), minimum, median, and 
maximum. Graphical presentations will also be used to examine trends over time using mean 
values ( ±SE) and mean changes from Baseline (±SE) at each of the scheduled visits (using 
observed cases).
Analysis of secondary and other efficacy endpoints:
Continuous secondary  efficacy  endpoints will be anal yzed using the same ANCOVA model with 
missing values imputed by similar MImethod as the oneused for the primary  efficacy  endpoint 
analysis. Differences between treatment groups and CI s will be estimated by  this method. 
Categorical efficacy  endpoints will be analy zed by  Cochran -Mante l-Haenszel method stratified 
bythe randomization strata. For t he HbA1c <7.0% anal ysis, parti cipants with missing 
HbA1c data at Week 30 or Week 56 will be considered non- responders in the ITT population.
Comparisons of time to event endpoints between treatment groups will be performed using the 
Cox proportional hazards regression model with the treatment groups (efpeglenatide 2, 4, or 6 mg, 
placebo), randomization stratum of Screening HbA1c (<8%, ≥8%), randomization stratum of 
Visit 3 (Baseline, Day  1) BMI (<30 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2), and geographical region as the factors.

Property of the Sanofi group -strictly confidential Page 242 INTRODUCTION
Efpeglenatide is a GLP-1 RAthat is being developed for once -weekly treatment of T2DM .
2.1 STUDY RA TIONA LE
The primary  objective of this study  is to assess the effect of the different doses of efpeglenatide on 
glycemic control as measured by  the change in HbA1c from Baseline at Week 30, a well -accepted 
benchmark of overall and longer -term gl ycemic control. Main secondary  objectives include 
assessing the effect of efpeglenatide on treatment success factors (proportion of participants who 
achieve HbA1c goals of <7.0%), additional gl ycemic parameters ( FPG, 7-point self- monitored 
plasma glucose [SMPG ]profiles [24- hour profile, mean 24- hour SMPG, average pre -breakfast 
SMPG, prandial glucose excursions]), proportion of participants requiring rescue therapy , time to 
initiation of rescue therapy ,and on bod y weight.
2.2 BACKGROUND
Several classes of pharmacological treatments are approved for glucose control in T2DM, but 
good gl ycemic control remains challenging for many  patients and new therapy  options are 
necessary .
In recent years, the GLP -1 RA class of pharmacotherap
y for T2DM has evolved as an effective 
treatment option from multiple daily  over daily  to weekl y injection. Glucagon- like peptide 1
(GLP-1) is an endogenous enteroendocrine hormone secreted by  L-cells of the distal intestine in 
response to oral nutrient ingestion, and it has multiple phy siologic effects that contribute to 
ameliorating h yperglycemia. These e ffects include enhancing insulin secretion from pancreatic 
β
-cells in a glucose dependent manner, suppressing glucagon secretion, and slowing gastric 
empty ing. Due to their glucose -dependent mechanism of action, GL P-1 RAs are generall y 
associated with a low risk of hy poglycemia.
Efpeglenatide (SAR439977), a GLP -1 RA, is a novel long -acting form of CA exendin-4 
(anexendin -4 analogue) that is being developed for the trea tment of T2DM by  once -weekl y 
SCinjection with an auto -injector. In clinical Phase 2 st udies, it has shown effects on bod y weight 
and may  therefore provide potential for development for use in obesit y.
In total, 7 clinical studies (two Phase 1 studies and five Phase 2 studies) in approximately  
1000 participants, with approximately  720 expose d to efpeglenatide, have been completed. The 
Phase 2 studies have been conducted in participants with T2DM and in obese non- diabetic 
individuals. I n participants with T2DM, weekl y doses between 0.3 to 4 mg or monthly  doses 
between 8 to 16 mg were used, whe reas in non
-diabetic obese s ubjects, weekly  doses of 4 to 6 mg 
and doses of 6 and 8 mg every  other week were investigated. Overall, these studies have 
demonstrated that efpeglenatide effect improves glycemic control and reduce bod y weight, with 
an overall favorable safety  and tolerability  profile consistent with currentl y available GLP -1 RAs. 
Three weekl y efpeglenatide doses (2, 4, or 6 mg) have been selected based on the Phase 1 and 2

2.3 BENEFIT/RISK A SSESSM ENT
The non
-clinical toxicological data and the safet y data from clinical studies with efpeglenatide to
date (with a cut -off date of 22 June 2017) suggest a safet y profile consistent with the known AE
profile of currentl y marketed GLP -1 RAs with the exception of potential liver toxicity . The 
following safet y procedures are planned for the clinical study EFC14822:
Potential AEs common to the GL P
-1 RAdrug class are mainl y GI disorders such as 
nausea/vomiting and rarely  pancreatitis. Thus far, no case of pancreatitis has been 
identified with efpeglenatide. The trend over time for nausea and vomiting events 
appeared dose -related with an increase after the first injection, and generally  decreasing 
thereafter within a period of approximately  2to 4 weeks. It is anticipated that the planned, 
gradual dose escalation scheme emplo yed in study EFC14822 will reduce intensity  and 
frequency  of GI events, mainly  such as nausea and vomiting. 
Increase in heart rate (HR) is a known side- effect of GL P-1 RA s. In the current stud y 
EFC14822, both periodic monitoring of vital signs inc luding 
HR and blood pressure (BP)
and 24- hour electrocardiogram ( ECG )recording (Holter) will be performed to monitor for 
any effects on HR. 
The GL P-1 RA class has a box warning related to risk of thy roid C -cell tumors in the US 
label, based on findings in rodents. As the relevance for humans is unclear, GL P-1 RAs 
are contraindicated in participants with a personal or family  history  of medullary  thyroid 
cancer (MTC ) or in participants with multiple endocrine neoplasia sy ndrome T ype 2
(MEN -2). In EFC14822, calcitonin will be monitored throughout the study , and 
participants with history  of MTC or MEN -2 or with elevated calcitonin levels 
(≥5.9 pmol/L  [20 pg/mL ]) at Baseline will be excluded from the study . 
Diabetic retinopath y complications have been reported for one of the GLP -1RA s(as of 
05December 2017) . No case s have been reported for efpeglenatide. Participants with a 
recent or planned retinal treatment for retinopathy or maculopathy will be excluded in the 
current stud y. Diabetic retinopathy complications will be monitore d throughout the study .
Additional safet y monitoring in stud y EFC14822 includes the collection of AEs, anti -drug 
antibodies ( ADA
s;immunogenicity [4,5]),as well as safet y laboratory  and 12 -lead ECG. 
In the 3 Phase 2 cl inical studies with efpeglenatide (HM- EXC -203, HM -EXC -204, and 
HM-EXC -205), overall a total of out of 571 participants on efpeglenatide and out of 
183 participants on comparators had post- baseline AL T elevation ≥3 × ULN; most had 
confounding factors (3).In this stud y, patients with elevated liver enzy mes >3 ×upper 
limit of the normal
(ULN ) or total bilirubin >1.5 × ULN (except in cases of 
Gilbert’s syndrome) 
will be excluded from participation. L iver function tests will be done

Property of the Sanofi group -strictly confidential Page 26Efpeglenatide concentrations will also be sampled in study  EFC14822. These sparse 
pharmacokinetic (PK ) samples will be used for population PK analy ses to determine the 
PKcharacteristics of efpeglenatide in the target T2DM population.
The risks to the study  participants will be minimized by  careful participant selection according to 
appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria based on existing nonclinical and clinical data. During 
the study  participants will be closely  monitored at the regular visits, including ph ysical 
examinations and laboratory  tests to monitor the glucose -
lowering effects and to earl y detect 
eventual adverse reactions.
Placebo injections will not contribute to lower the plasma glucose, but the participation in the 
study may  increase participant motivation and result in an improvement of gly cemic control. In 
any case the close monitoring will detect early  deterioration of gl ycemic control and allow 
initiation of “rescue therapy ” as deemed necessary. The HbA1c and FPG tests will be performed 
approximately  every  3 to 4 months. Participants will be provided with a glucose meter and test 
strips to regularly  self-measure their plasma glucose. Gly cemic control central laboratory  alerts on 
FPG and on HbA1c (at Week 12 onward
s) will be set up to ensure that gl ycemic parameters 
remain under predefined rescue thresholds.
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonabl y 
expected AEs of 
efpeglenatide may  be found in the IB(3).

3.1 APPROPRIA TENESS OF MEA SUREMENTS
Efpeglenatide monotherapy  in participants with T2D Mwho have inadequate gl ycemic control 
with diet and exercise is expected to lower HbA1c over 30 weeks of treatment (primary  efficacy  
analysis).
The concentration of HbA1c reflects the gl ycemic history  of the previous 120 day s and is thus an 
index of mean gl ycemia, documenting gl ycemic control over the past 2 to 3 months. 
Hemoglobin A1c has also been shown to correlate with the development of long -term 
complications of diabetes, and reduction of HbA1c is known to reduce the risk of long -term 
microvascular complications. Therefore, HbA1c is considered an appropriate primary  endpoint for 
assessing the effect of a treatment on gl ycemic control. 
The problem of weight gain in T2DM is widely  recognized. More than 80% of individuals with 
T2DMare overweight, many  at the time of diagnosis. Consequently , iatrogenic weight gain is not 
only unwelcome, but represents an important clinical issue that can become a barrier to the 
successful management of gl ycemic control. Therefore, in this study , assessing change in bod y 
weight from Baseline to Week 30 and Week 56 is a secondary  endpoint. 
Improvements in pre-prandial and post-prandial plasma glucose ( PPG)have been observed with 
efpeglenatide in previous studies. Therefore, assessment of both pre-prandial plasma glucose and 
PPG (by  7-point SMPG profile) is relevant in this study . These 2 parameters are also considered 
by regulatory  agencies to b
e supportive of efficacy of an antidiabetic agent.

4.1 OVERA LL DESIGN
The current protocol EFC14822, is a m ulticenter, 30 -week, randomized, double- blind, 
placebo- controlled Phase 3 study  with an additional 26 -week controlled Safety  Extension Period 
evaluating the efficacy  and safet y of efpeglenatide as a monotherap y in participants with 
inadequatel y controlled with diet and exercise.
Eligible participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 dose levels of efpeglenatide (2, 4, or 6 mg) or to 
placebo, to be administered SC once -weekl y. Randomization will be stratified by HbA1c at 
Screening (<8%, ≥8%) and BMI (<30 kg/m2,≥30 kg/m2)at Visit 3 (Baseline, Day  1). Masked 
weekl y dose escalation over the course of 5 weeks will be use d to reach the assigned 4 and 6 mg 
efpeglenatide weekly  doses. Escalation will start from 2 mg once- weekly  to the maximum of 4 or 
6 mg once -weekl y,as assigned at Randomization. Participants randomized to the efpeglenatide 
2 mg dose arm will also initiate dosing at 2 mg once-weekl y and remain on this dose for the 
treatment duration. In order to blind the treatments, both efpeglenatide and placebo wil l be 
provided in volume -matched, PFS.
The study  will be comprised of 4 periods as follows: 
An up to 3- week Screening Period (with a minimum of 1 1days)
A
30-week double -blind, placebo -controlled Core Treatment Period, for efficacy  and 
safet y assessment
A 26 -week double -blind, placebo -controlled 
Treatment Extension Period; participants will 
remain on the randomized I MP regimen
A 6-week Follow -up Period to collect post -treatment safet y information for all participants
after last dose of IMP
The maximum study  duration per participant will be 65 weeks. 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC RA TIONA LEFOR STUDY DESIGN
This study  is designed to demonstrate the efficacy  and safet y of efpeglenatide when used as 
monotherap y in participants with T2DM who have inadequate gl ycemic control with diet and 
exercise. Efpeglenatide will be compared to placebo, consistent with regulatory  guidance. Based 
on the study  design, the protocol stipulates that participants can receive antidiabetic rescue 
therap y according to a predefined algorithm. 
A placebo control will be used to allow for an unbiased assessment of treatment effects and safet y 
data. Bias will be minimized by  randomizing the participants to treatment groups, blinding the 
participants, the Investigators, and the Sponsor to the treatment allocations, and by  adjudicating 
the selected AEs in a blinded fashion.

Property of the Sanofi group -strictly confidential Page 31A parallel -group, randomized placebo -controlled design was selected because trial participants are 
exposed to a single treatment and dose , and assignment to that treatmen t is based solel y on 
chance. This design is free of the limitations of competing designs such as crossover in which 
there may  be a carry over of effect from the first to the second treatment. Although this carry over 
effect can be minimized with a washout pe riod, it is possible that some longer -term effects may  
persist. While the sample size of the parallel group design is larger to account for more variability  
when participants cannot serve as their own control, the above- mentioned limitations of the 
crossov er design have led the randomized controlled trial design to be the standard for therapeutic 
confirmatory  trials for regulatory approval such as this trial.
4.3 JUSTIFICA TION FOR DO SE
The selection of efpeglenatide 2, 4, and 6 mg once -weekl y doses is based on the results of early  
phase studies. 
Efpeglenatide has shown increasing efficacy  up to the highest dose tested. Both once -weekly  
2mg and 4 mg doses have shown clinicall y relevant efficacy in study HM -EXC -203. The 
achieved Hb1Ac reduction indicates tha t the dose -
response plateau has not been reached with the 
4 mg dose ;this may  suggest higher efficacy  of the 6 mg dose compared to the 4 mg dose can also 
be expected for gl ycemic control in diabetic patients. The once- weekl y 6mg dose tested in 
non-diabeti c subjects in the Phase 2 study  (HM -EXC- 205) has shown higher efficacy  in the 
decrease of bod y weight than the once- weekl y 4mg dose in this population.
Nausea and vomiting events appeared to be dose related and the trend over time showed an 
increase in in cidence after the first injection with a general decrease thereafter for all tested doses. 
Based on the observed general decrease of GI event incidence after the first week of treatment 
with efpeglenatide, dose increases to achieve the higher doses of 4 an d 6 mg (in the corresponding 
arm) will be in 2 mg step intervals every  2 weeks in order to minimize the GI adverse effects. The 
escalation step of 2 mg is small enough to contribute to improvement of GI tolerability  at dose 
increase. With this dose escalat ion schedule, the dose of 4 mg once -weekly will be achieved 
2weeks and the maximal dose of 6 mg once -weekly  will be achieved onl y 4weeks after the first 
dose of efpeglenatide.

Dosing instructions The injection interval of the IMP is once -weekly on the same week day (eg, each Monday) at 
any time of the day. Injections should be administered SC to the abdomen . Within this region, 
the site of injection should be changed (rotated) at each time to prevent skin reactions. The site, 
date, and time of administration should be recorded for each injection administration.
For selected visits during the Core Treatment Period up to Week 30 (corresponding to pre -dose 
PK sample collection) the weekly dose will be administered at the site after blood sample 
collection (see SoA, Section 1.3).
For the other weekly administrations, if a dose is missed, participants must be instruct edto 
administ er the dose as soon as possible if there are at least 3 days (72 hours) until the next 
scheduled dose. If less than 3 days remain before the next scheduled dose, participant sshould 
skip the missed dose and administer the next dose on the regularly scheduled day. In each 
case, participant s should then resume their regular once -weekly dosing schedule. The day of 
weekly administration can be changed if necessary as long as the last dose was administered 
3or more days before.

Routine fasting SMPG and central laboratory  alerts on FPG (and HbA1c at Week 12 [Visit 7] 
onward) are set up to ensure that gly cemic parameter results remain below the predefined 
thresholds.
If 1 fasting SMPG value exceeds the specific gly cemic limit on 1 day, the participant
checks it again during the 2 following day s. If all the values in 3 consecutive day s exceed
the specific limit, the participant should contact the Investigator and a central laboratory
FPG measurement (and HbA1c at Week 12 [Visit 7] onward) be performed as soon as
possible for confirmation
Upon receipt of a central laboratory  rescue alert, a central laboratory  re-test must be
completed and confirmed as exceeding the threshold for rescue before rescue therap y is
initiated. The re -test confirmation should be performed as soon as possible by unscheduled
visit
In the event that a confirmatory  FPG and/or HbA1c exceed the threshold, the Investigator should 
ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for insufficient glucose control and in par ticular that:
The increased FPG has been tested at a fast ed state (ie, no food intake or liquid intake
[except water] for ≥8 hours)
IMP wasappropriatel y injected (as per weekl y schedule)
There was no intercurrent disease, which may  jeopardize gl ycemic control (eg, infectious
disease)

Compliance to diet and lifesty le was appropriate
If any of the above mentioned reasons can reasonably  explain the insufficient gl ycemic control, 
the Investigator should consider not initiating rescue medication and should undertake appropriate 
action, ie:
Assess FPG (ie, after ≥8 hours fast)
Initiate an evaluation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in 
AE/concomitant medication parts of the electronic Case Report Form [ e-CRF ]and the 
medical record)
Stress the absolute need to be compliant with treatment
Organi ze a specific interview with the participant and a Registered Dietician or other 
qualified nutrition professional to reinforce the absolute need to be compliant with diet and 
lifesty le recommendations, and schedule a nFPG/HbA1c assessment at the next visit
If none of the above mentioned reasons can be found, or if appropriate action fails to decrease 
FPG/HbA1c under the threshold values, rescue medication may  be introduced.
If a participant needs to start rescue therap y, an unscheduled in -person visit will be scheduled to 
perform pre -rescue assessments (as specified for EOT; Week 56/Visit 14], except the 7- point 
SMPG and 24 -hour ECG), prior to starting the rescue medication(s).

generated b y Sanofi.
In accordance with the double -blind design, Investigators will remain blinded to study treatment 
and wil l not have access to the randomization (treatment )codes except under exceptional medical 
circumstances. 
Members of the CEC will review and adjudicate events in a blinded manner (please refer to 
Appendix 1 [ Section 10.1] ).
The Investigator will not have access to the data of the primary  efficacy  endpoint (ie, HbA1c) or
FPG obtained after Baseline /
Randomization visit (Visit 3) as tho se data will be masked. Ifthe
central laboratory  detects FPG above the rescue thresholds ,the Investigator will receive an alert 
from the central laboratory  (see Section 6.1.2.1 ). The HbA1c alerts will also be sent if a value is 
above threshold at the W eek 12 visit (Visit 7) onwards.
6.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study
The blind may  be broken if, in the opinion of the Investigator , it is in the participant’s best interest 
for the Investigator to know the IMP assignment. The Sponsor must be notified before the blind is 
broken unless identification of the IMP is required for a medical emergency in which the 
knowledge of the specific blinded IMP will affect the immediate management of the participant’s 
condition (eg, antidote available). In this c ase, the S ponsor must be notified within 24 hours after 
breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source 
documentation and e-CRF, as applicable.
Code breaking can be performed at an y time b y using the proper module of the interactive 
response technology  (IRT)and/or b y calling an y other phone number provided by  the Sponsor for
that purpose. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, time of day , and
reason for code breaking. If the code is broken b y the Investigator, the participant must withdraw
from IMP administration. When documenting the reason for unblinding, the Investigator must not 
provide an y detail regarding the nature of the IMP. The Investigator should not divulge IMP detail 
to the Sponsor’s representative or to an y staff members until d atabase closure. Furthermore, when 
completing forms (eg, AE, SAE, adjudication information), the IMP should not be disclosed on 
the forms.
Randomization code breaking will also be performed during the anal ysis of the PK serum 
concentration samples and ADA samples in order to enable the laboratory  to sort the samples 
(verum [dose group], placebo) and start anal yzing the samples (verum group only ) while the stud y 
is still ongoing . Onl y the Project manager and lead scientist at the Bioanal ytical laboratory ,as
well as the population PK anal yst,will have access to the randomization code to allow for the 
sorting of the efpeglenatide blood samples. The Bioanal ytical lab oratory and responsible 
personnel will follow the standard procedures to ensure the protection of the blind within the 
Sponsor’s clinical team. The randomization code or the individual anal ytical results will not be 
disclosed to any  clinical team personnel prior to the database lock.

consent.
7.1 DISCONTINUA TION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION
The IMP should be continued whenever possible. 
In case the IMP is stopped, it should be determined whether the stop can be made temporarily ; 
permanent IMP discontinuation should be a last resort. Any  IMP discontinuation must be fully  
documented in the e
-CRF . In an y case, the participant should remain in the study  as long as 
possible to collect endpoint data at Week 30 and Week 56 and vital safet y status at the scheduled 
end of study time.
7.1.1 Permanent discontinuation
Permanent intervention discontinuation is any  intervention discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator not to re -expose the 
participant to the I MP at any  time 
during the stud y, or from the participant not to be re -exposed to the IMP whatever the reason.
The participants may  withd raw from treatment with I MP if they  decide to do so, at any  time and 
irrespective of the reason . Participant sshould discuss stopping study medication with thesite
before doing soinorder thatquestions canbeaddressed, concomitant therapy canbeadjusted if
needed, andafollow -

A participant should withdraw from treatment with I MP in case of the follo wing:
Intercurrent condition that requires discontinuation of IMP: eg, laboratory  abnormalities 
(see decision tree and general guidance for the follow- up of laboratory  abnormalities in 
Appendix 5 [ Section 10.5.1] ), diagnosis of acute pancreatitis confirmed b y 
gastroenterologic evaluation and imaging, unless a clear cause unrelated to IMP is 
confirmed and the particip ant has recovered from pancreatitis (see 
Appendix 5
[Section 10.5.2] ), or calcitonin value ≥50 pg/mL 
(seeAppendix 5
[Section 10.5.3])

detrimental to the participant
’s well -being

As all data until the scheduled date of stud y compl etion will be used in statistic al analy ses, it i s 
important to collect data for all participant s, under treatment or not, during the 56 weeks of the 
study . A high rate of missing data could jeopardize efficacy  results of the study . See the SoA
(Section 3.1) for data to be collected at the time of intervention discontinuation and follow -up and 
for an y further evaluations that need to be completed.
Any abno rmal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately  rechecked for 
confirmation (as soon as possible, preferabl y within 24 hours) before making a decision of 
permanent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned participant.
Handling of participants after permanent intervention discontinuation
Every  effort s hould be made to maintain participan ts in the study . Participants will be followed -up 
according to the stud y procedures specified in this protocol up to the scheduled date of stud y 
completion, or up to recovery  or stabilization of any  AE to be followed- up as specified in this 
protocol, whichever comes last.
If possible, the participants will be assessed using the procedure normall y planned for the 
EOT
Visit including a PK sample when the permanent discontinuation occurred during the core 
treatment period and visit can be scheduled 7 days after the permanent discontinuation of 
intervention .For participants who discontinue IMP but remain in the study, the remaining visits 
should occur as scheduled wh ere possible. The Investigators should discuss with them key  visits 
to attend. All efforts should be made t o continue to follow the participant s for primary  and 
secondary  endpoints, after the discontinuation of treatment.
The value of all their study  data collected during their continued involvement will be emphasized 
as important to the public health value of the stud y. Participants who withdraw from the stud y 
intervention should be explicitly  asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their decision,
and an y AE information elicited must be documented.
All cases of permanent intervention discontinuation must be recorded b y the Investigator in the 
appropriate pages of the e-CRF when considered as confirmed.
7.1.2 Temporary  discontinuation 
Temporary  intervent ion discontinuation corresponds to 
at least 1dose not administered to the 
participants.
AllIMPdiscontinuation should initially beconsidered astemporary unless permanent
discontinuation ismandated bytheprotocol (seeSection 7.1),andtheInvestigator should make

discontinuations, dura tion should be recorded b y the Investigator in the appropriate pages of the 
e
-CRF. 
7.1.2.1 Rechallenge
Reinitiation of intervention with the I MP will be done under close and appropriate clinical/and or 
laboratory  monitoring once the Investigator will have conside red according to his/her best medical 
judgment that the responsibility  of the IMP(s) in the occurrence of the concerned event was 
unlikely .In case of IMP intolerance, a one-time re- challenge is recommended following 
temporary  discontinuation before decidi ng to permanently  discontinue the I MP. If a maximum of 
2 consecutive doses are missed, the I MP can be restarted with the last dose given. In cases of 3 or 
more consecutive doses are 
missed, the titration is highl y recommended to be re -initiated to 
minimize the risk of GI events (especially  if the temporary  discontinuation was related to a 
GIevent) .
Participants who temporarily  discontinue IMP should be reassessed at every  visit to determine 
whether it is possible to safel y resume IMP. If a decision has bee n made that the discontinuation is 
permanent, then the participant should be considered as permanentl y discontinued and the 
corresponding e- CRF page should be completed. Please note that permanent discontinuation 
should be a last resort.

A participant may  withdraw from the study  at an y time at his/her own request, or may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety , behavioral, compliance, or 
administrative reasons.
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use an y data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.
If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may  request destruction of any  samples taken 
and not tested, and the Investigator must document this in the site study
 records.
See SoA ( Section 1.3) for data to be collected at the time of study  discontinuation and follow - up 
and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed.
All study  withdrawals should be recorded b y the Investigator in the appropriate screens of the

Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA
(Section
1.3), is essential and required for study  conduct.
All S creening evaluations must be completed and reviewed before confirming Visit 2 in 
IRT, to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility  criteria. Eligibility  criteria 
will be evaluated again before randomization, including additional criteria at the end of 
Screening Period (see Section 5.2). The Investigator will maintain a Screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility  or record reasons for 
Screening failure, as applicable. 
8.1 EFFICA CY ASSESSMENTS
8.1.1 Hemoglobin A 1c
The primary  efficacy  endpoint and 2 secondary  efficacy  endpoints are assessed by  measurement 
of HbA1c. For the eligibility  and efficacy  assessments of the study , HbA1c is measured at 
different time points during stud y, by a certified level I  “National Gl ycohemoglobin 
Standardization Program” central laboratory . 
If a participant needs to receive rescue antidiabetic medication
(see Section 6.1.2.1 ), assessment 
of HbA1c should be performed before the introduction of the rescue medication (s).
8.1.2 Fasting plasma glucose
Plasma glucose will be assessed in the fasting st ate (as defined in Section 5.3.1 ) according to the 
schedule detailed in the SoA ( Section 1.3). If participant is not fasting at the time of the visit a 
re-test should be scheduled in fasting status for the next day  (or as soon as possible). For the 
efficacy  assessments of the study , FPG is measured at a central laboratory .
8.1.3 7
-point self -monitored plasma glucose profiles
The 7 -point SMPG w ill be performed over a single 24 -hour period, on at least 1 day  within the 
weeks prior to selected study  visits (see SoA, Section 1.3), and must be recorded in the participant 
diary . Participant should repeat the 7 -point SMPG profile if any time point is missed.

Property of the Sanofi group -strictly confidential Page 49The 7 -point SMPG profile should be measured at the following 7 points: pre -breakfast and 
2hours post -breakfast, pre -lunch, 2 -hour post-lunch, pre -dinner, 2 -hour post-dinner ,and at 
bedtime. Two hours post -prandial (breakfast, lunch ,and dinner) is defined as 2 hours after the 
start of the meal.
On day s when 7- point profiles are done, fasting pre-breakfast SMPG will be considered as the 
first point of measurement, ie, “pre -breakfast” time point. 
8.1.4 Body  weight
Body weight will be measured to allow the estimation of change from Baseline to Weeks 30 
and56 in body  weight.
Body weight is measured according to the schedule detailed in the SoA ( Section 1.3)with the 
participant wearing onl y undergarments or very  light clothing and no shoes, and with an empt y 
bladder.
The same scale should be used throughout the study, and calibrated on a regular basis as 
recommended b y the manufacturer. Calibration should be docu mented in source documents. 
Theuse of balance scales is recommended; if digital scales are used, testing with standard weights 
is of particular importance . The floor surface on which the scale rests must be hard and should not 
be carpeted or covered with other soft material. The scale should be balanced with both weights at 
zero and the balance bar aligned. The participant should stand in the center of the platform as 
standing off -center may  affect measurement. T he weights are mov ed until the beam balances 
(thearrows are aligned). The weight is read and recorded in the e- CRF and source documents. 
Self-
reported weights are not acceptable; participants must not read the scales themselves.
8.1.5 Use of rescue therapy
The use of rescue medications for hy pergl ycemia will be assessed and reported throughout the 
treatment period to allow determination of the start of rescue treatment and the percentage of 
participants using rescue therap y at Weeks 30 and 56. Routine fasting SM PGs will be measured 
by the participants, and alerts on FPG and/or HbA1c will be sent to the Investigator from the 
central laboratory  to ensure that gly cemic parameter results remain within predefined thresholds. 
For details and further actions should FPG and/or HbA1c values rise above thresholds, refer to
Section 6.1.2.1.
8.1.6 Patient Qualitative A ssessment of Treatment 
The Patient Quali tative Assessment of Treatment version 2 (PQAT
v2; see Appendix 9; 
Section 10.9) is intended for the collection of participant -perceived benefit -risk of 
glucose -lowering treatment with IMP.

Property of the Sanofi group -strictly confidential Page 50This participant qualitative assessment should take between 10 and 20 minutes to complete. 
Theparticipant s will be asked to complete it from home just before the on- site visits planned at 
Weeks 30 and 56. They will be asked to do it by  themselves without any  help from friends or 
relatives. Use of this questionnaire will be limited to participant s in countries where PQAT v2is 
available in the local language .
At the beginning of the Weeks 30 (Visit 10) and 56 (Visit 14) patient visits, I nvestigators will 
have to review participant’s answers in order to identify  any potential AEs reported b y 
participant s within the open -ended questions. Investigators will discuss with the participant’s
potential AEs identified; Investigators will not discuss an y other aspects of the answers with the 
participant , and will not ask participants to change their answers. If AEs that wer e previousl y not 
captured are identified during this process, they  should be reported as described in
Appendix 3 (Section 10.3).
If a participant discontinues treatment with IMP during the Treatment Period, the participant will 
be asked to complete the PQATv2 at the time of discontinuation. Even if he/she remains in the 
study , the participant will not need to complete it again at t he following scheduled visits: Week 30 
and/or Week 56 .
8.2 SAFETY A SSESSMENTS 
Planned time points for all safety  assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3).
8.2.1 Physical examinations
A complete ph ysical examination will be performed as per clinical practice in order to 
assess the health status of the participant at 
Screening and evaluate the inclus ion/exclusion 
criteria .
At the following on- site visits ,a limited phy sical examination focused on any  affected 
body  area or organ sy stem and other sy mptomatic or related organ s ystem(s) will be 
performed.
Height will be measured at Screening onl y. If for any reason it was not measured at this 
visit,it can be measured at an y other visit in the study .
Investigators should pay  special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.

Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed in a seated position using the 
same device (automated BP monitor or a manual sphy gmomanom eter) for each 
participant.
At the Screening Visit (Visit 1), BP will be meas ured on both arms to identify  and select the 
appropriate arm for future measurements. Seated BP should be measured in both arms after at 
least 5-minute rest period, and then again after 1 minute in both arms while the participant is 
in a seated posi tion. T he arm with the highest sy stolic BP will be determined at this visit, and 
BP should be measured in this arm throughout the study. This highest value will be recorded 
in the e- CRF.
Atsubsequent visit s, BP and pulse measurements are to be done at participan ts’ identified 
appropriate arm and should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in a 
quiet setting without distraction s (eg, television, cell phones)
Heart rate will be measured at the time of the measurement of seated BP
8.2.3 Electrocardiograms
8.2.3.1 12-lead electrocardiogram
A 12-lead ECG recording will be performed locally  as scheduled in SoA (see Section 1.3).
The 12
-lead ECG should be performed after at least 10 minutes in supine position and prior to 
other study  procedures at that visit (eg, blood collection, I MP administration). The Investigator 
should review the ECG trace and document the interpretation, sign and date the ECG print out and 
record it in the e -CRF. Each ECG trace must be compar edwith the S creening ECG results. 
Alloriginal ECG traces must be kept as source data. The ECG assessment of “normal” or 
“abnormal” will be anal yzed .
Note: Any  new EC G abnormality  should be rechecked for confirmation and reported as an AE if 
considered clinically  significant by  the Investigator.
8.2.3.2 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram including diary
Holter ECG will be collected over approximately  24 hours starting on selecte d visits as presented 
in the SoA (see Section 1.3). Twent y–four hour average and night time average HRwill be 
derived based on the Holter monitoring. 
Instruction and diary  for participants’ notes while they  are wearing the ECG device will be 
provided b y the Investigator.

If the Holter ECG needs to be repeated to get a complete evaluation, Randomization may  be 
delay ed by up to 7 days.
8.2.4 Clinical safety  laboratory  assessments
SeeAppendix 2 ( Section 10.2) for the list of clinical laboratory  tests to be performed and to the 
SoA (Section
1.3)for the timing and frequency of sample collection . 
The Investigator must review the laboratory  report, document this review, and record any  
clinically  relevant changes occurring during the study
 in the AE section of the e-CRF. 
Thelaboratory  reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically  significant 
abnormal laboratory  findings are those which are not associated with the underly ing 
disease, unless judged b y the Investigator to be more severe than expected for the 
participant's condition.
All laboratory  tests with values considered clinically  significantl y abnormal during 
participation in the study  should be repeated until the values return to normal or B aseline 
or are no longer considered clinically  significant by  the Investigator or Medical Monitor.
- If such values do not return to normal or Baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable b y the Investigator , the etiology  should be identified and the Sponsor
notified.
All protocol -required laboratory  assessments, as defi ned in Appendix 2 ( Section
10.2), 
must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory  manual and the SoA (Section

Property of the Sanofi group -strictly confidential Page 538.2.5 Hypoglycemia
During the study , participants must be instructed to document an y hypogl ycemic episodes in their 
study  diary . Hypoglycemia will be reported in the specific hypoglycemia event information form 
in e-CRF with onset date and time, sy mptoms and/or signs, the SM PG value if available, and the 
treatment. Hy poglycemia fulfilling the seriousness criteria will be documented in addition on the 
SAE form in the e -CRF.
Hypoglycemic events will be categorized ( 7, 8, 9 ) as follows (also see Appendix 8 
[Section
10.8] ):
Severe hypoglycemia: Severe h ypogl ycemia is an event that 
requir esthe assistance of 
another person to actively  administer carbohy drate, glucagon, or other resuscitative 
actions. These episodes may  be associated with sufficient neurogl ycopenia to induce 
seizure, unconsciousness or coma. Plasma glucose measurements may  not be available 
during such an event, but neurological recovery  attributable to the restoration of plasma 
glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by  a low 
plasma glucose concentration. The definition of severe s ymptomatic h ypogl ycemia 
includes all episodes in which neurological impairment was severe enough to prevent 
self-treatment and which were thus thought to place participants at risk for injury  to 
themselves or others. Note that “requiring assistance of another person” means that the 
participant could not help himself or herself. Assisting a participant out of kindness, when 
assistance is not required, should not be considered a “requiring assistance” incident.
Severe h ypogl ycemia will be qualified as an SAE only  if it fulfills SAE criteria 
(seeAppendix 3 [ Section 10.3] ). For example, events of seizure, unconsciousness ,or 
coma must be reported as SAEs.
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia: Documented sy mptomatic hy poglycemia is an 
event during which t ypical symptoms of h ypogl ycemia are accompanied b y a measured 
plasma glucose concentration 
≤3.9 mmol/L  (≤70 mg/dL). Clinical s ymptoms that are 
conside red to result from a hy poglycemic episode are, eg, increased sweating, 
nervousness, asthenia/weakness, tremor, dizziness, increased appetite, palpitations, 
headache, sleep disorder, confusion, seiz ures, unconsciousness, or coma
Asymptomatic hypoglycemia: Asymptomatic hypogl ycemia is an event not accompanied 
by typical s ymptoms of hy pogly cemia but with a measured plasma glucose concentration 
≤3.9 mmol/L  (≤70 mg/dL)
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia: Probable sy mptomatic hy pogly cemia is an event 
during which symptoms of hy poglycemia are not accompanied by  a plasma glucose 
determination, but was presumably  caused b y a plasma glucose concentration 
≤3.9 mmol/L  (≤70 mg/dL); s ymptoms treated with oral ca rbohydrate
Relative hypoglycemia: (recently  termed “pseudo -hypoglycemia”) is an event during 
which the person with diabetes reports an y of the typical s ymptoms of hy poglycemia, and 
interprets the s ymptoms as indicative of h ypogl ycemia, but with a measured plasma 
glucose concentration >3.9mmol/L  (>70 mg/dL)

hypoglycemia with a measured plasma glucose concentration <3.0 mmol/L ( <54 mg/dL) will also 
be anal yzed (9).
Hypoglycemic events will be evaluated regardless of the time of onset during the study  and time 
of the day .
In addition, hy poglycemia events will be evaluated at the following time periods defined b y time 
of the day :
Nocturnal hypoglycemia defined by time of the day: any hypoglycemia of the above 
categories that occurs between 00:00 and 05:59, regardless of whether the 
participant was 
awake or woke up because of the event
Daytime hyp oglycemia: any hypoglycemia of the above categories that occurs between 
06:00 and 23:59
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS A DVERSE EVENTS
Adverse event of special interest
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor ’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by the Investigat or to the Sponsor is required. Such events may  require 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. The classification of AESI may 
be changed during the study  by protocol amendment (eg,further AE classified as AESI, or AE 
losing the ir AESI status).
Pregnancy  of a female participant entered in a study as well as pregnancy  occurring in a 
female partner of a male participant entered in a study  with IMP/NIMP (see Section 8.3.5) ; 
-
In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued. 
Symptomatic overdose (serious or nonserious) with I MP/NIMP ;
-An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP is an event suspected by  the 
Investigator or spontaneously  notified b y the participant and defined as at least twice 
the planned dose (e g,two or more injections) if given within 3 days (72 hours)
-An ove rdose (accidental or intentional) with the NIMP is an event suspected by  the 
Investigator or spontaneously  notified b y the participant and defined as at least twice 
the recommended dose during the planned interval (s)
-Of note, as ymptomatic overdose has to b e reported as a standard AE
Increase in ALT >3×ULN (see Appendix 5 [ Section 10.5])
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found inAppendix 3 ( Section 10.3).
Adverse events will be reported by  the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the participant's legally  authorized representative).

up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study  intervention or study  procedures, or that 
caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention and/or study  (see Section 7). 
Adverse events requiring specific monitoring
An AErequiring specific monitoring is a serious or non
-serious AE of sci entific and medical 
concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring may  be 
appropriate. Such events may  require further investigation to characterize and understand them. 
These events should be reported on the AE page and additional information required on specific 
e-CRF page (where applicable) and will only  qualify  for expedited reporting when serious 
(fulfilling SAE criteria).
The AEs requiring specific monitoring for this study are: 
Severe GI events
Severe hypoglycemia (see Section 8.2.5)
Pancreatic events (including abnormal values of pancreatic enzymes 
[seeAppendix 5,Section 10.5.2] pancreatitis, and pancreatic neoplasm ) – will be 
adjudicated by CEC
Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; cardiovascular ( CV)death, myocardial 
infarction ( MI), or stroke) and other specific CV events (eg, heart failure leading to 
hospitalization) –will be adjudicated b y CEC
Calcitonin increase >5.9 pmol/L  (20 pg/mL) a nd thy roid C -cell neoplasm 
(seeAppendix 5, [Section 10.5.3])
Acute renal failure (see Appendix 5 [ Section
10.5.4] for definition)
Diabetic retinopath y complications (will b

8.3.2 Method of detecting A Es and SA Es
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the partic ipant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences. 
8.3.3 Follo w
-up of A Es and SA Es
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, non- serious AESI s, and AEs requiring specific 
monitoring (as defined in Appendix 3 [ Section
10.3]), will be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, the 
event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in 
Section 7.3). Further information on follow - up procedures is given in Appendix 3 ( Section 10.3).
8.3.4 Regulatory  reporting requirements for SA Es
The following are requirements for reporting of SAEs:
Prompt notification by  the Investigator to the Sponsor of anSAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safet y of 
a study  intervention under clinical investigation are met. 
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authority  and 
other regulat ory agencies about the safet y of a study  intervention under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor will comply
 with country -specific regulatory  requirements 
relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory  authority , Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and Investigator s.
Investigator safety  reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory  requirements and Sponsor policy  and 
forwarded to Investigator s as necessary .
An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety  report describing a nSAE or other 
specific safet y information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review 
and then file it along with the IBand will notify  the I RB/IEC, if appropriate a ccording to 
local requirements.

8.3.8 Guidelines for reporting product complaints/medical device incidents (including 
malfuncti ons)
Any defect in the IMP/NIMP/device must be reported as soon as possible by  the Investigator to 
the monitoring team that will complete a product complaint form within required timelines.
Appropriate information (eg, samples, labels or documents like pic tures or photocopies) related to 
product identification and to the potential deficiencies may  need to be gathered. The Investigator
will assess whether or not the quality  issue has to be reported together with an AE or SAE.
8.4 TREATMENT OF OVERDOS E
The Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.
In the event of an overdose, the Investigator should:

as specified in the SoA (see Section 1.3). Instructions for the collection and handling of 
biological samples will be provided b y the Sponsor. The actual date and time (24 -hour 
clock time) of each sample will be recorded along with the date,time, and site (abdomen)
of drug administration . Samples not collected, missed or lost, for any reason should be 
recorded
For a subset of participants, 10% of total (N=12 per group): 1 additional post -dose sample 
will be taken either 4 days (±1 d ay) after 
1stIMP dose (Week 1), or 4 day s (±1 day) after 
4thdose (Week 4), or 4 days (±1 day) after 12thdose (Week 12). To reach this number and 
due to the blind design of the study , PK post -dose sample will be collected in the first 
80 randomized participants who will accept this additional sampling ,sign the separate 
section of the main consent form and provide a valid post -dose sample
The collected blood samples will be used to determine concentration of efpeglenatide in 
serum and these concentra tion data will be summarized and reported in the CSR
The co ncentrations data will be used to perform a population PK analy sis by  non- linear
mixed effects modeling and the results will be reported in a separate population PK report
Samples collected for ana lyses of 
efpeglenatide serum concentration may also be used to 
evaluate safet y or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study if

9.1 STATISTICA L HYPOTHES ES
For the primary  efficacy  variable of change from Baseline to Week 30 in HbA1c, the following 
statistical null hy pothesis and alternative will be tested for each efpeglenatide dose:
H0: No treatment difference
H1: e fpeglenatide has a higher reduction in HbA1c from Baseline than placebo
Based on data from previous Phase 1 and 2 studies and modeling, a minimum treatment effect 
difference of -0.6% in HbA1c change from Baseline to Week 30 was considered as reasonable for 
this study .
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMIN ATION 
The sample size calculations are performed based on the primary  endpoint, change in HbA1c (%) 
from Baseline to Week 30.
A sample size of approximately 100 participants per arm (ie, 100 participants for each of the

difference of -0.5% ( -0.6%) between each dose of efpeglenatide and placebo in HbA1c change 
from Baseline to Week 30, assuming a common standard deviation of 1.1% (2- sided, α=0.05) for 
each comparison. 
Hence, there are 4 parallel dosing arms:
Efpeglenatide 2 mg, N=100
Efpeglenatide 4 mg, N=100
Efpeglenatide 6 mg, N=100
Efpeglenatide placebo, N=100
Hierarchical procedure will be done to adjust the multiplicity  of comparison.

Primary
Change in HbA1c from 
Baseline to Week 30Primary analysis:
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using all HbA1c values at Baseline and Week 30 
(observed or imputed), regardless of treatment discontinuation or in itiation of rescue therapy 
(ITT estimand).
The primary analysis method for the primary efficacy endpoint will be an ANCOVA model with 
missing values imputed by MIanalysis method in two parts as follows:
 Missing endpoint data in participants who prematurely discontinue the study treatment 
before the Week 30 visit will be imputed using a model estimated from participants in the 
same treatment arm who prematurely discontinue the study treatment before the Week 
30 visit but have the measurement for the endpoint (retrieved dropouts). Considering that 
the number of participants in each treatment arm who discontinue the study treatment 
but have the measurement for the endpoint is expected to be small, a simple imputation 
model will be us ed, where only the baseline measurements are included as the predictor. 
Each treatment group will have their own imputation model. Missing data will be imputed 
using the regression method. 
 Missing endpoint data in all participants, including those in the efpeglenatide arms, who 
stay on the study treatment until the Week 30 visit will be imputed separately, using a 
model estimated from participants in the placebo group who stay on the study treatment 
until the Week 30 visit and have the endpoint data availa ble. The imputation model will 
include the randomization strata and corresponding baseline values without including 
any intermediate. Missing data will be imputed using the regression method. 
In this analysis, missing endpoint values will be imputed 10 000 times to generate 10 000 data sets 
with complete data. The completed data sets will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with 
treatment groups, randomization strata, and geographical regions as fixed effects and the 
corresponding baseline values as a covariate.  
The Baseline value is defined as the last available value prior to the first dose administration of 
IMP or the last available value on or before the date of Randomization if not treated with the 
double -blinded IMP. 
The results from the 10 000 analyses will be combined using Rubin’s formula and provide the 
adjusted mean change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 30 (regardless of treatment 
discontinuation or initiation of rescue therapy) for e ach treatment group, as well as the difference 
between each efpeglenatide dose and placebo and the 95% CI for the difference. 
A hierarchical procedure will be applied to adjust for the multiplicity of comparison on the primary 
endpoint:
 First, the highest dose of efpeglenatide (6 mg) will be compared to placebo to 
demonstrate superiority of this dose versus placebo 
 If superiority is demonstrated for efpeglenatide 6 mg, the superiority of 4 mg dose of 
efpeglenatide versus placebo will be tested 
 If superio rity is also demonstrated for 4 mg dose, the lowest dose (2 mg) will be tested 
for superiority over placebo
When the superiority is not obtained in a step, the sequential testing procedure will be stopped.
As noted, the number of retrieved dropouts is expected to be small, and may not have sufficient 
data to support the imputation approach in item 1 described above. If there are less than 
5participants in any arms who prematurely discontinue the study treatment before the Week 30 
visit but have the measure ment for the endpoint, a back- up imputation method for the primary 
efficacy analysis will be used. In particular, missing endpoint data in all participants in both

efpeglenatide and placebo groups, regardless of staying on the study treatment or not, will be 
imputed using a model estimated from participants in the placebo group with endpoint data, where 
randomization strata and corresponding baseline values are included as the predictors. Missing 
data will be imputed using the regression method. 
Sensitivit y analysis:
Tipping point analysis based on the same MI method as described above will be performed to 
examine the robustness of the re sults from the primary analysis .A penalty δ will be added to 
participants in efpeglenatide groups (2, 4, or 6 mg) who have no HbA1c data at Week 30. The 
penalty will be gradually increased to evaluate at which level the conclusion of the analyses in 
terms of statistical significance is changed for each efpeglenatide dose group. The tipping point is 
the penalty level, at w hich the magnitude of efficacy reduction in participant s without HbA1c data at 
Week 30 creates a shift in the treatment effect of efpeglenatide from being statistically significantly 
better than placebo to a non -statistically significant effect. The penalt y δwill start at 0 and increase 
by 0.01 at each imputation until non -statistically significance is found. Least square mean 
difference between each efpeglenatide dose and placebo and its associated p -value will be 
provided for each penalty level. 
The pri mary endpoint will be assessed too by an ANCOVA model with missing values imputed by 
Control -based MI method (copy to reference) under the MNAR framework in the ITT population. 
Data will be imputed 10 000 times.
 For placebo participants, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data 
 For participants in the efpeglenatide groups, missing data will be imputed as if the 
participants were on placebo throughout the study 
In particular, a 2 -step approach will be used:
 Step 1: Use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method conjunction with the 
IMPUTE=MONOTONE option in PROC MI to create an imputed data set with a 
monotone missing pattern
 Step 2: Based on the MONOTONE data sets obtained from Step 1, build the imputation 
model using the regression method on data from the placebo group, and use the built 
model conditional on the participant’s previous observed data to impute the missing data 
in both placebo and efpeglenatide groups. The imputation model will include the 
randomization stratum of HbA 1c value at Screening (<8 %, ≥ 8% ), and the randomization 
stratum of Visit 3 (Baseline, Day 1) BMI (<30 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2). This will be 
implemented using MNAR statement in PROC MI
Each of the complete datasets after the imputation will be analyzed using the same ANCOVA
model as used for the primary analysis. Results from each complete dataset will be combined 
using Rubin’s formula.
Descriptive analyses will be conducted to explore missing data patterns for HbA1c in the primary 
efficacy analysis, with number and percenta ge of participants in each of the following categories 
presented by treatment group.
 Pattern 1: participants without Baseline if any
 Pattern 2: participants with Baseline but without post -Baseline value during the 30 -week 
Core Treatment Period
 Pattern 3: participants with Baseline and at least 1 po st-Baseline value during the 
30-week Core Trea tment Period but not at Week 30
 Pattern 4: participants with Baseline and Week 30 value during the 30 -week Core 
Treatment Period
HbA1c values by visit will be presented by missing data pattern for each treatment group, using 
descriptive statistics and/or graphs

Assessment of treatment effect by subgroup:
Primary efficacy endpoint will be further analyzed to examine the consistency of the treatment 
effect across the subgroups defined by the following Baseline covariates:
 Race (White, Black or African American, Asian, Other) (any race groups with fewer than 
5participants may be combined with “Other” category as appropriate) 
 Ethnicity (Hispanic, Not Hispanic)
 Age grou p (<50, ≥50 to <65, ≥65 years) (any category with fewer than 5 participants 
may be combined with another category as appropriate)
 Gender (Male, Female)
 Duration of diabetes (<10, ≥10 years)
 Baseline HbA1c (<8.0 %, ≥8.0%)
 Baseline BMI (<30 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m ²)
 Country
 United States /non-United States
 Baseline estimated GFR categorie s (mL/min/1.73m²): (<30; [30 -60]; ≥60)
The treatment effects (efpeglenatide 2, 4, or 6 mg, versus placebo) across the subgroups defined 
for each of these factors will be estimated for the change from Baseline to Week 30 in HbA1c in 
the ITT population, and using a similar approach as applied to the analysis for the primary efficacy 
endpoint. The ANCOVA model will include treatment groups (efpeglenatide 2, 4, or 6 mg, placebo) 
and randomi zation stratum of Screening HbA1c (<8 %, ≥8% ), randomization stratum of Visit 3 
(Baseline, Day 1) BMI (<30 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2), subgroup factor, treatment -by-subgroup factor, and 
region as fixed factors and using Baseline HbA1c value as a covariate. The adjus ted estimates of 
treatment mean differences (each efpeglenatide dose versus placebo) with SE and 95 % CIs will be 
provided as appropriate across the subgroups. A graphical presentation of the results (ie, forest 
plot) will also be provided.
In the case that the subgroup factor is identical or similar to a randomizat ion strata factor 
(eg,Baseline HbA1c, Baseline BMI), only the subgroup factor (as a single factor or an interaction 
term) will be included in the model in order to avoid the issue of collinearity in the analysis. The 
corresponding strata factor will not be included in the model. In case that the subgroup factor is 
country, the region will not be included in the model.
Summary statistics (for Screening value, Baseline value, observed values, and ob served changes 
from Baseline) at scheduled visits will be provided by treatment group for HbA1c value over the 
whole treatment period including the 26 -week Safety Extension Period. The summary will include 
the number of observations, mean, SD, SE, minimum, median, and maximum. Graphical 
presentations will also be used to examine trends over time using mean values (±SE) and mean 
changes from Baseline (±SE) at each of the scheduled visits (using OC).

Categorical efficacy endpoints will be analyzed by Cochran Mantel Haenszel method stratified by 
the randomization stratum of Screening HbA1c (<8 %, ≥8% ) and randomization stratum of Visit 3 
(Baseline, Day 1) BMI (<30 kg/m2, ≥30 kg/m2). For the HbA1c <7.0% analysis, participants with

population.

will be tested in the order of 6 mg, 4 mg, and 2 mg. once the primary endpoint is statistically 
significant at α=0.05 (2 -sided) for all 3 efpeglenatide doses, a hierarchical testing procedure will be 
performed to test the following st udy secondary efficacy endpoints by the following prioritized 
order:
1. HbA1c <7% at Week 30 for efpeglenatide 6 mg v ersus placebo (yes/no)
2. HbA1c <7 % at Week 30 for efpeglenatide 4 mg versus placebo (yes/no)

An independent DMC with members who are independent from the Sponsor and the Investigators 
will meet on a regular basis and will be responsible for:
Review of accumulating clinical study  safet y data, and
Making a recommendation to the Sponsor regarding the stud y following each meeting
The DMC reviews and analy zes, on a regular basis, unblinded safet y data throughout the stud y, as 
well as safet y data from the other ongoing clinical studies conducted with efpeglenatide (a single 
DMC for the whole efpeglenatide program) . Details describing the DMC processes and 
procedures are outlined in the DMC Charter. To maintain continuous blinding and stud y integrit y, 
the anal ysis will be conducted by  an independent statistician who will directly  transfer data to 
DMC members, and measures will be taken to ensure the validity of the data.
10.1.4.2 Clinical Endpoint Committee
Independent CEC (s)will be composed of experts in the field of cardiology ,neurology  and 
gastroenterology  (and other appropriate medical specialties as needed). This committee will be 
independent from the Sponsor, the CRO and the Investigators, and will be implemented to review, 
assess and/or adjudicate all events of death, selected cardiovascular events ( non-fatal myocardial 
infarction , stroke, unsta ble angina leading to hospitalization, and heart failure leading to 
hospitalization) , pancreatic events and other selected AEs (to be defined in the CEC charter). This 
review will be conducted in a blinded manner with regard to stud y treatment.
10.1.4.3 Independent Expert
An independent ophthalmologist expert will review in a treatment -blinded manner all reported 
AEs suspected to be diabetic retinopath y-related to assess the presence of retinopathy and 
relationship of repor ted AE to IMP.

RECORDING, EVA LUATING, FOLLOW -UP, A ND REPORTING
DEFINITION OF AE
AE definition
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical study  participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study  intervention , whether or not considered related 
to the study  intervention .
NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of study  intervention .
Events 
meeting the AE definition
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or 
other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from B aseline, considered clinically significant in the med ical 
and scientific judgment of the Investigator (ie, not related to progression of underly ing 
disease).
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New condi tions detected or diagnosed after study  intervention administration even though 
it may  have been present before the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequela e of a suspected overdose of either study  
intervention or a concomitant medication.
"Lack of efficacy " or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy  assessments.
However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy  
will be reported as AE or SAE if they
 fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. 
Events NOT meeting the AE definition
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  the 
Investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
The disease/di sorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.

Version number: 1
Property of the Sanofi group -strictly confidential Page 76Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the star t of the study  that do not worsen.
DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/s ymptoms of the disease under study , death due to 
progression of disease).
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a)Results in death
b)Is life -threatening
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time o f the event. I t does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically  might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c)Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually  
involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency  ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitaliz ation are AEs. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE 
should be considered serious.
Hospitalization for electi ve treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from 
Baseline is not considered an AE.
d)Results in persistent disability/incapacity
-The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.
-This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may  interfere with or 
prevent every day life f unctions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e)Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f)Other situations:
- Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting 
is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize 
the participant or may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually  be 
considered serious.

emergency  room or at home for allergic broncho spasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
RECORDING AND FOLLOW -UP OF AE AND/OR SAE
AE and SAE /AESI recording
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the Investigator to review all
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory  reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.
The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the e-CRF.
It is notacceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to S ponsor representative in lieu of completion of the SAE/AESI e-CRF page.
There may  be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by  
the S ponsor representative . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before 
submission to Sponsor representative .
The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
The Investigator will submit any  initial SAE /AESI data to the Sponsor representative
within 24 hours of its acknowledgement.
Assessment of intensity
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity  for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study  and assign it to 1 of the following categories:
Mild: An event that is easily  tolerated by  the participant, causing minimal discomf ort and 
not interfering with every day activities.
Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal every day 
activities.
Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category  utilized for rating the 
intensity  of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described 
in the definition o f an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of causality
The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y intervention and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.

Property of the Sanofi group -strictly confidential Page 78A "reasonable possibility " of a relationship conveys that there are fa cts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.
The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant ther apy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study  intervention
administration will be considered and investigated.
The Investigator will also consult the IBand/or Product Information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to a Sponsor representative . However, it is very 
important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for every 
event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor representative .
The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality  in light of follow -up information 
and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality  assessment.
The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulat ory reporting 
requirements.
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested by  Sponsor 
representative to elucidate the natu re and/or causality  of the AE or SAE as fully  as 
possible. This may  include additional laboratory  tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.
If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized Follow - up 
Period, the Investigator will provide the S ponsor representative with a copy  of any  
post-mortem findings including histopathology .
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed e-CRF.
The Investigator will submit any  updated SAE /AESI data to the Sponsor representative
within 24 hours of receipt of the information.
REPORTING OF SAE s/AESIs
SAE reporting to S ponsor representative via an electronic data collection tool
The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE/AESI to Sponsor representative will be the 
electronic data collection tool.
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the 
paper SAE/AESI data collection tool.

INFORMA TION
DEFINITIONS :
Woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post- menopausal unless 
permanentl y sterile (see below).
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
1.Premenarchal
2.Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
-Documented h ysterectomy
-Documented bilateral salpingectomy
-Documented bilateral oophorectom y
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history  interview.
3.Post-menopausal female :
-A post -menopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may  be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy  (HRT ). However, in the absence of 
12months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. 
-Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the non- estrogen hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study  enrollment.

Female participants
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they  agree to use a 
highl y effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in Table 9.
In addition, WOCBP must refrain from donating ova for the durat ion of the study  and at least 
5weeks after last dose of study  treatment.
Table 9
-Highl y effective contraceptive methods
Highly effective contraceptive methods that are user dependenta
Failure rate of <1%  per year when used consistently and correctly.
Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
 Oralb
 Intravaginal 
 Transdermal
Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
 Oralb
 Injectable
Highly effective me thods that are user independenta
 Implantable progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
 Intrauterine device (IUD)
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)
 Bilateral tubal occlusion
Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner o f the 
WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of con traception should be 
used.
Sexual abstinence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of risk associated with the study intervention . The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to 
the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with local regulations 
regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies. 
bPharmacokinetic drug -interaction potential of oral hormonal contraception with the study treatment is low, but still unknown. Therefore, if the 
oral contraceptive cannot be replaced by other highly effective method of contraception, with different route of administrati on, the hormonal 
contraception method must be supplemented with a male condom (for partner) during the treatment period and for at least 5 weeks after the 
last dose of study treatment.
PREGNANCY TESTING :
WOCBP should only  be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative highly  
sensitive serum pregnancy  test

Pregnancy  testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cy cle is missed or when 
pregnancy is otherwise suspected 
COLLECTION OF PREGNANCY INFORMATION:
Male participants with par tners who become pregnant 
The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy  information on any  male participant’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this study . This 
applies only  to male participants who receive IMP
After obtaining the necessary  signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly , the Investigator will record pregnancy  information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy . The 
female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor . 
Generally , the follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery  date. An y termination of the pregnancy  will be reported regardless of fetal status 
(presence or absence of anomalies) or indicatio
n for the procedure
Female p artici pants who become pregnant 
The Investigator will collect pregnancy  information on any  female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. I nformation will be recorded on the 
appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a 
participant's pregnancy . The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy . The Investigator will collect follow- up information on the participant and the 
neonate and the information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generall y, follow -up will 
not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks bey ond the estimated delivery date. Any  
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence 
of anomalies) or indication for the procedure
Any pregnancy  complication or elective termination of a pregnancy  will be reported as an 
AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be 
reported as such. An y post -study  pregnancy  related SAE considered reasonably  related to
the study  intervention by the Investigator will be reported to the Sponsor as described in
Section 8.3.4. While the Investigator is not obligated to actively  seek this information in 
former stud y participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting
Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study  will

10.5.2 Monitoring of participants with increased lipase and/or amy lase >2 ULN
GLP-1 RAs stimulate pancreatic beta -cell and suppress alpha -cell function. Some cases of acute 
pancreat itis have been reported with marketed GLP -1 RAs. Therefore participant s enrolled in this 
study  should be closel y monitored for an y suspected pancreatitis, eg, with sy mptoms and/or signs 
of acute abdominal distress or abnormal levels of pancreatic enz ymes. Serum amy lase and lipase 
concentrations are monitored routinel y at Screening, Baseline and periodically during the stud y 
treatment period. 
In the presence of clinical signs and/or s ymptoms evocative of pancreatitis, eg, persistent 
abdominal pain, which can radiate to the back, often with characteristic positional features, with 
possible occurrence of nausea, vomiting, fever ,and leucocy tosis, further measurement of am ylase 
and lipase should be performed. The clinical signs and/or sy mptoms should be documented in the 
source data.
10.5.2.1 Elevation of amylase and/or lipase >2 x ULN without clinical signs and/or 
symptoms
In an y case where am ylase and/or lipase are >2 × ULN, a retest (centrall y assessed as far as 
possible) must be performed as follows:
If value( s) is/are >2 to 3 ×ULN: retest within 7 day s,
If value(s) is/are >3 ×ULN: retest within 48 hours,
If the value(s) remain(s) >2 ×ULN upon retesting: amy lase and/or lipase levels should be 
retested weekl y until values are <2 
×ULN.
In case a retest is >2 × ULN a gastroenterological evaluation and imaging (ultrasound and/or 
computed tomograph y [CT ] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI ] with contra st, as appropriate) 
is highly  recommended . The absence of clinical signs and/or s ymptoms should be documented in 
the source documents (if clinical signs and/or s ymptoms develop, please see Appendix 5 
Section 10.5.2.2 below).
Best clinical judgment is to be used when interpreting elevated serum am ylase and lipase levels in 
asymptomatic participants. Temporary  discontinuation of the I MP may  be considered in these 
cases if deemed necessary  by the Investigator.

Property of the Sanofi group -strictly confidential Page 8810.5.2.2 Elevation of amylase and/or lipase >2 ×ULN with clinical signs and/or symptoms.
In the presence of clinical signs and/or s ymptoms evocative of pancreatiti s (as previousl y 
described ) associated with elevated amy lase and/or lipase, treatment with the IMP should be 
promptly  and at least temporarily discontinued pending further clinical evaluation and diagnosis 
confirmation. Clinical signs and/or s ymptoms are to be documented in the source data. 
Alaboratory  determination of am ylase and lipase must be obtained at the time of the event and 
again within 48 hours or earlier as clinicall y indicated. If the value(s) remain(s) >2 ×ULN, then 
amylase and/or lipase leve ls should be retested as described in Appendix 5 Section 10.5.2.1 or
more often if clinically  indicated.
A gastroenterologic evalua tion and imaging (ultrasound and/or CT or MRI  with contrast, as 
appropriate) must be performed as clinicall y indicated and as per clinica l practice and local 
guidelines .If a diagnosis of pancreatitis is confirmed, I MP should not be restarted and should be
permanentl y discontinued. 
In both cases (Section 10.5.2.1 and Section 10.5.2.2) as previousl y described ,all laboratory  or 
clinical documentations are to be collected. If the retest confirms lipase and/or amy lase values are 
>2 ULN , the event must be reported in the e
-CRF on the specific AE form  and the specific 
complementary  forms, using the appropriate verbatim: eg, “increased am ylase and/or lipase” in 
case of isolated enzy me elevation, “suspected pancreatitis” in the presence of clinical s igns 
evocative of pancreatitis if the diagnosis is suspected but cannot be confirmed or excluded, and 
“pancreatitis” if the diagnosis has been confirmed.
10.5.3 Management of participants with increased calcitonin values
During the course of the study  if calciton in value is found ≥20 pg/mL (5.9 pmol/L): 
A retest should be performed by  the ce ntral laboratory  within 7 day s
The following is to be collected and recorded as soon as possible:
-Conditions other than C -cell disease which may  increase calcitonin levels, such as: 
smoking status, treatment with proton- pump inhibitor (eg, omeprazole), autoimmune 
thyroid diseases (Hashimoto’s thy roiditis or Grave’s disease), differentiated thy roid 
cancer, h ypercalcemia, hypergastrinemia, chronic renal insufficiency (not on dial ysis), 
other neuro-endocrine tumors (lung small cell carcinoma, intestinal carcinoid), acute 
pulmonary  inflammatory conditions, or sepsis
-Personal and/or familial medical history  in relation with thy roid or other endocrine 
diseases
-Specific ph ysical examin ation (neck, th yroid gland)
If the retest confirms that calcitonin value is ≥20 pg/mL : 
The event must be reported in the e-CRF on the AE form (as final diagnostic if available 
or as “increased calcitonin”); all appropriate clinical and laboratory  documentations should 
also be reported in the corresponding eCRF pages

The participant should continue to be followed according to protocol schedule (including 
planned calcitonin measurements). The AE form and all other related eCRF pages should 
be updated with an y new informat ion collected during the follow-up
If calcito nin value ≥50 pg/mL (14.75 pmol/L) is found at any  time during foll ow-up, the 
participant should be permanently discontinued from I M
Pand referred to a specialist. 
As far as possible, blood should be collected 1 to 2 weeks after I MP discontinuation and 
sent to the central laboratory  for calcitonin measurement. As per protocol, the participant 
should be followed according to study  procedures up to the scheduled end of the study
If at an y time during follow -up calcitonin value ≥20 pg/mL increases by  20% or more between 
2assessments (while remaining below 50 pg/mL), a repeated measurement should be performed 
earlier than scheduled in the protocol, ie, 1 month later. Once results are available, discussion with 
Sponsor representative should be initiated witho ut delay  for further guidance.
10.5.4 Gastrointestinal events in relation to acute renal failure
Acute renal impairment caused b y deh ydration is a potential risk described for other GLP- 1 RA. 
Acute renal impairment is not thought to be caused directly  by GLP-1 RA (including 
efpeglenatide) without dehy dration.
In case of prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting, if clinically  indicated, serum creatinine 
measurement should be performed at the central laboratory . If there is an acute increase of serum 
creatinine, metf ormin must be discontinued (if concomitantly  taken) until resolution of renal 
dysfunction. Please also refer to Appendix 5 ( Section 10.5.1), increase in serum creatinine

Overview of study 
interventions 
administeredAdditional instructions have been provided for 
the timing of IMP administration prior to PK 
pre-dose (expected to be 6 to 7 days)We need PK samples which are far enough removed 
from the period between time of injection and C max
(Tmax) such that the large, random fluctuations in 
concentration which typically occur during that period 
will not confound our estimates. Because for 
efpegl enatide C maxtypically occurs around 4 days after 
injection, PK samples taken during the first 5 to 6 days 
after dosing will still be heavily influenced by random 
fluctuations in C maxand T max, and essentially 
uninformative with regard to clearance.

Section 7.1.2.1 
Rechallenge”Consecutive” was added to the text:
If a maximum of 2 (two) consecutive doses are 
missed, the IMP can be restarted with the last 
dose given. In cases of 3 (three) or more 
consecutive doses are miss ed, the titration 
should be re -initiated.To clarify the conditions when the re -titration with IMP 
is needed following temporary discontinuation.
Section 8.3 Adverse 
events and serious 
adverse eventsText to define symptomatic overdose with the 
IMP as at least twice the planned dose given 
within 3 days (72 hours) is addedTo separately define the overdose of IMP considering 
longer half -life of efpeglenatide
Sections 8.3.8.1
Appendix 6These sections have been removed
Appendix 6 has been made “Not applicable”It was clarified that the study intervention is not a 
medical device per regulatory definition so no related 
information and reporting rules are applicable. It is a 
combined product. Sponsor’s procedures for product 
technical complaints will be followed.

protectionText for collection of participants race and 
ethnicity addedRace is collected in this trial as it is requested by 
regulatory authorities and the information was missing

Committee s 
StructureAddition of pancreatic events (and need for 
gastroenterologist) to events adjudicated by 
CEC
Addition of Independent Expert for review of all 
reported AEs suspected to be diabetic 
retinopathy -relatedBoth pancreatic events and diabetic retinopa thy 
complications are included in the Adverse Events 
requiring specific monitoring. Pancreatic events were 
planned be adjudicated by the CEC, but by mistake 
they were omitted from description of the Committee. 
Based on the recent reporting of diabetic reti nopathy 
complication for another drug in same class, it was 
decided to add an independent expert to review all 
reported events for confirmation and causality 
assessment.

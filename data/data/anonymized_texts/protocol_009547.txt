PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  A Pilot Study of the Renuvion APR System when Used as an Adjunct Procedure in 
Gynecomastia Surgery  
Investigational Device:  The Renuvion APR Handpiece (K191542) is a sterile, single use electrosurgical (monopolar) 
device intended to be used in conjunction with compatible generators for the 
percutaneous delivery of radiofrequency energy and/or helium plasma for cutting, 
coagulat ion and ablation of soft tissue. The Renuvion APR Handpiece is compatible with 
the Electrosurgical Generators BVX- 200H/P (K170188), and APYX- JS3/RS3 (K192867) 
owned by Apyx Medical that are indicated for delivery of radiofrequency energy and/or 
helium gas plasma to cut, coagulate, and ablate soft tissue during open and laparoscopic 
surgical procedures.  
  
Development Phase:  Pilot   
Study Purpose : To evaluate the use and safety of the Renuvion APR System as an adjunct procedure to 
bilateral gynecomastia surgery . 
Brief Study Overview:  This is a prospective, multi -center, single -blinded, randomized study of up to  10 study 
subjects undergoing bilateral gynecomastia surgery with Renuvion APR System used as an adjunct procedure on one side.   The study will be conducted at up to 3 investigational 
centers in the United States.   
 
At baseline, the grade of gynecomastia will be recorded by side, male chest measurements 
will be taken, and pre -surgery photographs taken in the frontal, lateral, and oblique views.  
 
The gynecomastia surgery and Renuvion APR System use will be as per investigator’s standard clinical practice. During the procedure, fat transfer and treatment of the lateral chest and/or axilla is not allowed. The Renuvion APR System will be used on one side only. 
The treated side will be randomized and the patient will be blinded as to which side of the 
chest received Renuvion. 
Procedure data and adverse events will be captured. 
Endermology is not allowed post -procedure. Post -procedure compression  will be  used  for 
2-3 weeks with a standard compression vest  for all subjects.  
 
Follow -up images, grade of gynecomastia, and male chest measurements will be taken at 
D30/D90/D180.  
 
All images will be assessed for correct identification of Renuvion -treated side by blinded 
Independent Photographic Reviewers (IPR) following the D180 visit.  
 
Following study participation, the subject will be offered an optional balancing treatment 
to the side not previously treated with Renuvion.

2. INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
2.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION  & RATIONALE  
 
Energy has been applied in some form to tissue since the beginning of recorded history.  The practice of applying heat to tissue through the use of cauteries was used for thousands of years as an invaluable method of controlling hemorrhage.  Continuous improvement of methods for utilizing the beneficial effects of heat on tissue eventually led to the development of the basic concepts of electrosurgery we know today.  In October of 1926, Dr. Harvey 
Cushing used an electrosurgical unit developed by Dr. Willia m T. Bovie to successfully remove a highly vascularized 
brain tumor from a patient after previous failed attempts.  Today, electrosurgical instruments are used in almost 
every surgical procedure performed worldwide.
1 
Through this long history, the heat effects of the radiofrequency (RF) alternating current used in electrosurgery on 
cells and tissue have been well established.  Normal body temperature is 37°C and, with normal illness, can increase 
to 40°C without perman ent impact or damage to the cells of our body.  However, when the temperature of cells in 
tissue reaches 50°C, cell death occurs in approximately 6 minutes.2 When the temperature of cells in tissue reaches 
60°C, cell death occurs instantaneously.3 Between the temperatures of 60°C and just below 100°C, two simultaneous 
processes occur.1 The first is protein denaturation leading to coagulation which will be discussed in more detail 
below.  The second is desiccation or dehydration as the cells lose water through the thermally damaged cellular wall.  
As temperatures rise above 100°C, intrac ellular water turns to steam and tissue cells begin to vaporize as a result of 
the massive intracellular expansion that occurs.  Finally, at temperatures of 200°C or more, organic molecules are 
broken down into a process called carbonization.  This leaves behind carbon molecules that give a black and/or 
brown appearance to the tissue.  
 Understanding these heat effects of RF energy on cells and tissue can allow the predictable changes to be used to 
accomplish beneficial therapeutic results.  Protein denaturation leading to soft tissue coagulation is one of the most 
versatile and widely ut ilized tissue effects.  Protein denaturation is the process in which hydrothermal bonds 
(crosslinks) between protein molecules, such as collagen, are instantaneously broken and then quickly reformed as 
tissue cools.  This process leads to the formation of uniform clumps of protein typically called coagulum through a subsequent process known as coagulation.  In the process of coagulation, cellular proteins are altered but not 
destroyed and form protein bonds that create homogenous, gelatinous structures.  The resulting tissue effect of 
coagulation is extremely useful and most commonly used for occluding blood vessels and causing hemostasis.  
 
In addition to causing hemostasis, coagulation results in predictable contraction of soft tissue.  Collagen is one of the 
main proteins found in human skin and connective tissue.  The coagulation/denaturation temperature of collagen is 
conventionally state d to be 66.8°C, although this can vary for different tissue types.
4  Once denatured, collagen 
rapidly contracts as fibers shrink to one -third of their overall length.5  This principal of thermally -induced contraction 
of collagen through denaturation and coagulation of soft tissue is well known in medicine and is used to achieve 
beneficial results in ophthalmology, orthopedic applications, and the treatment of varicose v eins.  Once tissue is 
heated to the appropriate temperature, protein denaturation and collagen contraction occur resulting in a reduction 
of volume and surf ace area of the heated tissue.  Noninvasive use of RF devices, lasers, and plasma devices have 
been used for the reduction of facial wrinkles and rhytides caused by thermal -induced collagen/tissue contraction 
since the mid -1990s.6-11 
 
Recently, the use of thermal -induced collagen/tissue contraction has been expanded to minimally invasive 
procedures.  Laser -assisted lipolysis (LAL) and radiofrequency- assisted lipolysis (RFAL) devices have combined the 
removal of subcutaneous fat with sof t tissue heating to address  the skin laxity that often results from fat volume

removal.  These devices are placed in the same subcutaneous tissue plane as a standard suction- assisted lipolysis 
(SAL) cannula and are used to deliver thermal energy to coagulate the subcutaneous tissue including the underside 
of the dermis, the fascia, a nd the septal connective tissue.  The coagulation of the subcutaneous tissue results in 
collagen/tissue contraction.   
 
Apyx Medical Corporation’s product family of helium -based plasma technology (Renuvion/J -Plasma family of 
devices) has FDA clearance for the cutting, coagulation, and ablation of soft tissue.  The Renuvion APR  Handpiece is 
a new device designed to be a part of this helium- based plasma technology family. All devices in the product family 
are part of a system that consists of an electrosurgical generator unit, a handpiece, and a supply of helium gas.  RF 
energy i s delivered to the handpiece by the generator and used to energize an electrode.  When helium gas is passed 
over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is generated which allows heat to be applied to tissue in two different 
and distinct ways.  First, heat is generated by the actual production of the plasma beam itself through the ionization 
and rapid neutralization of the helium atoms.  Second, since plasmas are very good electrical conductors, a portion of the RF energy used to energize the electrode and generate the plasma passes from the electrode t o the patient 
and heats tissue by passing current through the resistance of the tissue, a process known as Joule heating.  These 
two sources of tissue heating give the Renuvion APR  device some advantages during use as a surgical tool for the 
coagulation and contraction of subcutaneous soft tissue.   
 
These advantages are as follows:  
1. The Renuvion APR  Handpiece device achieves soft tissue coagulation and contraction by rapidly heating the 
treatment site to temperatures greater than 85°C for between 0.040 and 0.080 seconds.   
2. The tissue surrounding the treatment site remains at much cooler temperatures resulting in rapid cooling after the application of the energy through conductive heat transfer.  
3. Focused delivery of energy on immediate heating of the fibroseptal network resulting in immediate soft 
tissue coagulation and contraction without unnecessarily heating the full thickness of the dermis.  
4. 360° tissue treatment without the need for the user to redirect the flow of energy due to electrical energy 
taking the path of least resistance.  
5. Unencumbered delivery of power regardless of the tissue impedance due to the unique power output from the electrosurgical generator.  
6. Low current RF energy resulting in minimal depth of thermal effect and prevention of over -treating tissue 
when performing multiple passes.  
 
Gynecomastia is a benign enlargement of the male breast due to proliferation of the glandular tissue.  It affects up 
to 65% of males at all stages of life, however, not all require surgical intervention.
17 Typically, gynecomastia presents 
as asymmetric and mostly bilateral.  Treatment options are varied, but liposuction, either alone or in conjunction 
with removal of the glandular tissue, is most commonly utilized.18 This study aims to evaluate the use and safety of 
the Renuvion APR System as an adjunct pro cedure to bilateral gynecomastia surgery . 
 
 
2.1.1  DEVICE NAME AND INDICATIONS FOR USE 
The Renuvion APR Handpiece is a sterile, single use electrosurgical (monopolar) device intended to be used in 
conjunction with compatible generators for the percutaneous delivery of radiofrequency energy and/or helium 
plasma for cutting, coagulation and ab lation of soft tissue. The compatible Generators operate at an adjustable 
power of up to 40W (expressed as 0 -100% where 100% is 40W) and provide an adjustable helium gas flow of 1- 5 
LPM.  
 Radiofrequency energy is delivered to the handpiece by the generator and used to energize the electrode.  When 
helium gas is passed over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is generated for soft tissue cutting, coagulation

or ablation. The Renuvion APR system consists of a handpiece (Figure 1), an electrosurgical unit (ESU, Figure 2), and 
a supply of helium gas (Figure 2).  RF energy is delivered to the handpiece by the ESU and used to energize an 
electrode.  When helium gas  is passed over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is generated which allows for 
conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the subject in the form of a precise helium plasma beam.

2.1.2 PRECLINICAL STUDIES  
Pre-Clinical Studies to Support Safe Tissue Temperatures during Device Use  
During the use of the Renuvion system in open surgical procedures involving subdermal tissue coagulation, the tip 
of the Renuvion handpiece is placed in the subcutaneous tissue plane through the same access ports used during suction assisted lipolysis proc edures (liposuction).  In this use, it is important to establish that both the external 
epidermal tissue temperatures and the internal subdermal tissue temperatures remain within safe limits.  The following pre -clinical studies were conducted to measure th ese temperatures on both live porcine skin tissue and ex 
vivo human skin tissue:  
1. RP-18032301:  Evaluation of Porcine Skin Tissue Epidermal Temperature During Subdermal J- Plasma 
(Renuvion) Application (Non -GLP)  
This was a pre -clinical study in which the Renuvion system was used to coagulate the subdermal tissue 
of porcine skin at various treatment parameters in order to measure the maximum temperature on the 
surface of the epidermis.  In this study, the maximum r ecorded epidermal surface temperatures were 
39.1
oC and 40.2oC.  These temperatures were recorded after performing six consecutive passes of the 
Renuvion system under the same area of tissue.  Six consecutive passes under the same tissue was 
included in the  study to represent a “worst case” scenario.  Six passes are not commonly performed 
clinically.  However, even in this “worst case” scenario the epidermal surface temperature remained within safe limits.  Pedroso, et.al, reported that because of superficia l thermal safety concerns, the skin 
surface temperature should be maintained below 45
oC.  This study was subsequently published1.  The 
summary of the published study is as follows:  
J-Plasma helium was used in porcine, liver, kidney and muscle tissue at 20%, 50% and 100% power 
and 1 L/min and 3 L/min gas flow at 1, 5, and 10 second intervals.  J -Plasma was then used in 
ovarian and uterine tissue at maximum power and gas flow settings in intervals of 1, 5, 10 and 30 
seconds.  Concluded that J -Plasma has predictable thermal spread in a variety of tissue types.  
Thermal depth of spread increased linearly with increased power setting, gas flow rate, and 
exposure time.  Even at settings that greatly exceeded the manufacturer’s recommendation, the depth of thermal spread associated with the J -Plasma device was less than 3 mm (regardless of the 
type of tissue) and the diameter of lateral spread was 12 mm or less.  
2. RP-18040201:  A Study Evaluating Tissue Contraction, External Tissue Temperature, and Internal 
Tissue Temperature When Using J- Plasma (Renuvion) on Ex Vivo Abdominoplasty Tissue (non -GLP)  
This was a pre -clinical study that was performed on ex vivo human tissue collected by a surgeon during 
previously conducted abdominoplasty procedures.  The Renuvion system was used to coagulate the 
subdermal tissue of the human skin samples at various trea tment parameters.  During treatment, both 
the maximum external epidermal tissue temperatures and the maximum internal subdermal tissue 
temperatures were measured and recorded.  The maximum external tissue temperatures ranged from 24.9
oC to 37.8oC.  This da ta serves to validate the maximum external tissue temperatures of 39.1oC and 
40.2oC reported in RP -18032301 measured in a live porcine model.  The maximum internal tissue 
temperatures ranged from 40oC to 80oC.  It is known from the literature that the reported range of 
temperatures causing collagen shrinkage varies from 60oC to 80oC.  Therefore, in order to cause soft 
tissue coagulation and collagen contraction, the target internal tissue temperature should be within this range.  Both the external and inter nal temperatures remained within safe limits when using the 
Renuvion system to coagulate the subdermal tissue of human skin samples.  
 
The results of the above summarized pre- clinical testing support the safe and effective use of the 
Renuvion® system in dermatological and general surgical procedures involving subdermal tissue coagulation.

2.2 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
2.2.1 POTENTIAL RISKS 
This treatment modality was designed to inherently minimize the risk to the subject. However, treatment with 
energy -based modalities (laser, radiofrequency, and plasma devices) produce subsequent heating of the soft tissue 
that could involve the following commonly Expected Treatment Effects (ETEs): discomfort/pain, edema, erythema, 
ecchymosis, hypoesthesia, temporary sensory nerve injury (touch sensitivity, itching, temporary numbness/tingling), 
transient migratory firmness, and temporary and/or transient c repitus.  
 
In addition to commonly expected treatment effects, treatment with the Renuvion APR device could involve the 
following risks: helium embolism into the surgical site due to inadvertent introduction into the venous or arterial 
blood supply system, unintended burns (deep or superficial), pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, temporary or 
permanent motor nerve injury, ischemia, fibrosis, infection, gas buildup, bleeding, hematoma, seroma, 
subcutaneous induration, pigmentation changes, increased healing time, unsatisfactory scarring, asymmetry and/or 
unacceptable cosmetic result.  
 
Risks associated with tumescent anesthesia (lidocaine and epinephrine) include blurred vision, mental/mood changes, drowsiness, dizziness, unusually slow heartbeat, rash, itching, swelling, anxiety, apprehensiveness, 
restlessness, tremor, weakness, sweating, palpitations, pallor, nausea and vomiting, headache, and respiratory 
difficulties.  
 
Subjects using drugs that reduce coagulation (aspirin or NSAIDs) may experience increased bruising or bleeding at the treatment site.  Any other medications prescribed for the procedure or after -procedure by the investigator have 
their own risks; these risks should be discussed with the subject.  
 
A grounding pad is used to ground/neutralize the electrical current. Subjects undergoing radiofrequency treatment 
will be kept away from contact with metal parts which are grounded, or which have appreciable capacitance to 
earth.  
 As the Investigator will be treating the subjects per their Standard Practice of Care, there may be additional risks associated with the gynecomastia procedure.  The Investigator will be responsible for properly reviewing all potential 
risks with the patie nt prior to treatment.  
Any unexpected or unforeseen complications will be managed by the investigator throughout the conduct of the 
study. Unforeseen or unexpected side effects not listed above will be reported to the sponsor and regulatory representatives (IRB) as they occur . 
 
2.2.1.1 
 MINIMIZATION OF POTENTIAL RISKS 
These risks are mitigated by utilizing qualified clinical Investigators who have training and are experienced in 
gynecomastia procedures and Renuvion procedures .  In addition, risks are mitigated by including only those subjects 
that meet the study eligibility criteria.  
2.2.2 POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
This study is being conducted to determine if there is a possible benefit of using the Renuvion APR  device  as an 
adjunct procedure to Gynecomastia surgery.

4.3.3 EVALUATION TOOLS  
The following evaluation tools will be used in this study:  
4.3.3.1 SOFT TISSUE PINCH THICKNESS OF THE UPPER POLE (STPTUP)  
The STPTUP is a measure of the soft -tissue pinch thickness of the upper pole, by isolating skin and subcutaneous 
tissue superior to the breast parenchyma, pinching firmly, and measuring the thickness with a caliper19. See Figure 
3. 
This will be performed at Bas eline, Day 30, 90, and 180.  
 
 
FIGURE 3: STPTUP  
 
4.3.3.2 SOFT TISSUE PINCH THICKNESS AT THE INFRAMAMMARY FOLD (STPTIMF)

4.3.3.5 MODIFIED GLOBAL AESTHETIC IMPROVEMENT SCALE (GAIS)  (ADDITIONAL ENDPOINT ) 
The Modified Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) is a subjective rating of improvement in treatment results 
compared to pre -treatment.  The Investigator will grade the overall improvement of the treatment area as indicated 
in Table 4 by comparing the subject’s appearance at follow -up visits against a photograph taken prior to procedure.   
Likewise, the subject will also rate their improvement compared to pre- treatment as shown in Table 5.

The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) is a 5 -point scale that rates global aesthetic improvement from the 
pretreatment appearance. The ratings are worse, no change, improved, much improved, and very much improved. 
It was validated by Dr. Carutthers , et al. for this use.  In this study both live observation and photo review are utilized 
by the physician or a qualified, delegated clinician and subject in order to assign a score. The P GAIS must be 
performed by the principal investigator, sub- investigat or or qualified clinician delegated by the principal investigator. 
Both the PGAIS  and SGAIS  should be completed in two steps:  
• Based on a live assessment of the subject while referring to the subject’s pre- treatment photographs 
(subjects should be given a hand mirror for assessment); and 
• Based on a comparison of the subject’s pre -treatment photographs to the current post -treatment 
photographs.  
4.3.3.6 PATIENT SATISFACTION QUESTIONNAIRE (PSQ)  
The study subjects will be asked to complete Subject Satisfaction Surveys (see A ttachment  A) at the 180- day follow -
up visit .

• Significant or uncontrolled medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator participation in the 
study may compromise the patient’s health.  
• History of autoimmune disease (excluding Hashimoto’s thyroiditis).  
• Known susceptibility to keloid formation or hypertrophic scarring.  
• Cancerous or pre -cancerous lesions in the area to be treated.  
• Possesses a surgically implanted electronic device (i.e. pacemaker).  
• Serious mental health illness such as dementia or schizophrenia; psychiatric hospitalization in the past two years.  
• Use of endermology post -procedure for the duration of the study.  
• Participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to consent and throughout study participation.  
• Subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, is not an appropriate candidate for the study.  
 
5.4 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
Subjects will receive compensation for completion of the 30, 90, and 180- day visits.  This small stipend will be 
outlined in the site specific ICF and approved by the IRB prior to subject enrollment.  
 
5.5  PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWAL OR TERMINATION  
5.5.1  REASONS FOR WITHDRAWAL OR TERMINATION  
All subjects have the right to withdraw at any point during the study without prejudice. The investigator can 
discontinue any subject, at any time, if medically necessary. Subjects must be discontinued from the investigation 
by the investigator at any time  for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of informed consent.  
• Any AEs for which treatment continuation would constitute an unacceptably high risk for the subject.  
 
5.5.2  HANDLING OF WITHDRAWALS OR TERMINATION  
The subject must undergo the recommended follow -up assessments specified for the last study visit unless 
contraindicated due to a medical condition. Withdrawn subjects who have been treated will not be replaced.  
 
Subjects who are discontinued from the study due to an AE(s) will be treated according to standard clinical practice  
and this protocol and will be followed -up until the final study visit/safety visit as described in Section 7.3 . All 
pertinent information concerning the AE will be documented  on the appropriate study specific CRF. 
 
A subject may discontinue from the study at any time without any penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is 
otherwise entitled. An Investigator may also discontinue a subject from the study without the subject’s consent, if the Investigator feels it is in the best medical interest of the subject.  The date and the reason for study withdrawal 
will be indicated on the Study Exit CRF.   
5.6 PREMATURE TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE STUDY  OR A STUDY  SITE 
The study or a study  site can be prematurely terminated or suspended by the sponsor. Reasons for termination of 
the study or a study  site may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Subject enrol lment is unsatisfactory.  
 
 
APX-21-02                                         Title: Gynecomastia Pilot Clinical Trial Protocol  
Revision: 01   Page 24 of 42 
• The risks and benefits of continuing the study  have been reassessed, and the risks outweigh any potential 
benefits.  
• The incidence of AEs constitutes a potential health hazard to the subjects.  
• New scientific data do not justify a continuation of the study . 
• The investigator or study site exhibit serious and/or persistent non- adherence to the protocol , the 
Declaration of Helsinki, EN ISO 14155, and/or applicable regulatory requirements.  
• The sponsor decides to terminate the study at any time for any other reason.  
Furthermore, the study may be prematurely ended if the regulatory authority or the IRB  has decided to terminate 
or suspend approval for the study, the study site, or the investigator.  
 
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended for any reason, the investigator must inform the subjects  and 
assure appropriate follow -up treatment. Within the timeframes noted in applicable regulations, the sponsor will 
promptly inform the investigators, study  sites, the IRB , and regulatory authorities  of the termination or suspension 
of the study, as well as provide reasons for the action.  
6. STUDY  DEVICE  
Cleared devices  (K191542) shipped for use in clinical investigations conform to the applicable general safety and 
performance requirements (GSPR) apart from the aspects covered by the clinical investigation and that, with regard 
to those aspects, every precaution is taken to protec t the health and safety of the subjects. This includes, where 
appropriate, technical, and biological safety testing and pre -clinical evaluation as well as provisions in the field of 
occupational safety and accident prevention and taking into consideration the state of the art.  Apyx Medical will 
provide devices for use in this clinical investigation.  
6.1 PACKAGING  & STORAGE  
The sponsor will provide appropriate packaging and storage instructions to the study sites.  
6.2 ACCOUNTABILITY  
The investigator, or designee, must maintain an inventory record using the site -specific Device Disposition Form of 
study devices received, used for treatment, and returned to the Sponsor to ensure that the device will not be 
dispensed to any person who is not a subject under the terms and conditions set forth in this protocol. There will be 
100% accountability for a ll devices.  The clinical study site shall maintain all devices received for clinical trial use in a 
locked, limited access cabinet or room unti l the end of the study unless they are returned to Apyx while the study is 
being conducted, such as at the end of study treatments.   Each site will use their existing generators for this study.  
6.3 DEVICE MALFUNCTION /OBSERVATION  
All malfunctions of, or defects of the delivery system will be reported to the Sponsor by the investigational sites.  
This will include situations where the delivery system did not perform as intended; user errors; study 
device/component being physically defec tive, including out of the box failure.  
7. STUDY  PROCEDURES  AND  SCHEDULE  
7.1 PRE-PROCEDURE  
Study subjects will have verification of eligibility criteria, a brief general examination including medical history, and 
pre-procedure assessments as detailed below completed within 30 days prior to undergoing the study procedure. 
In response to the ongoi ng coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) pandemic, preoperative testing can be completed at the 
Investigator’s discretion.  Pre -operative testing should be performed as close to the scheduled study procedure as 
feasible, but in time to get the results.  
 
 
APX-21-02                                         Title: Gynecomastia Pilot Clinical Trial Protocol  
Revision: 01   Page 25 of 42 
The following pre -treatment assessments will be performed:  
• Subject Gynecomastia Grade will be determined . 
• Baseline imaging – frontal, lateral, and oblique views.  
• Brief medical history and physical examination per the Investigator’s standard of care.  
• STPTUP  (Figure 3). 
• STPTIMF  (Figure 4). 
• Bilateral chest measurements ( Table 2) 
 
Medications  that the  subject is taking upon entry into the study should also be documented in the Case Report Forms 
(CRF). All concomitant prescription medications taken during study participation will be recorded on the appropriate 
study specific CRF. For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only 
by a properly authorized/l icensed clinician. Medications to be reported on the CRF and entered on the eCRF are 
concomitant prescription medications, over -the-counter medications, and non- prescription medications.  
Medication used for analgesia and/or anesthesia should be recorded as concomitant medication as well. To ensure 
the capture of the foregoing information on pre -existing conditions, sites should also be attentive to the need to 
document without limitation a nd whenever discovered: (1) all chronic, episodic or ‘as needed’ medications used 
before study enrollment; (2) prior episodic or ‘as needed’ therapeutic interventions, procedures , or hospitalizations; 
and (3) recent or planned surgical procedures.   
7.2 STUDY PROCEDURE  
The bilateral gynecomastia surgery and Renuvion APR System use will be as per investigator’s standard clinical 
practice. During the procedure, fat transfer and treatment of the lateral chest and/or axilla is not allowed. The 
Renuvion APR System will be use d on one side only, and alternate consecutively between patients, starting on the 
right side. For example, subject 001 will be treated with Renuvion on the right side, subject 002, will be treated on 
the left, subject 003 will be treated on the right, etc.   This treatment scheme will continue until enrollment has 
completed at each site. The subjects will be blinded as to which side has been treated with Renuvion.  
Procedure data and adverse events will be captured.  
 
Endermology is not allowed post -procedure  for the duration of the study.  
 
7.3 FOLLOW -UP PROCEDURES   
7.3.1 IMMEDIATELY POST-PROCEDURE  
All subjects will be required to wear a Sponsor -provided compression vest for 2 -3 weeks.  
7.3.2 FOLLOW -UP VISITS & SUBJECT CONTACT OUTSIDE OF FOLLOW -UP VISITS 
Investigators will follow -up with the study subjects, per their Standard of Care  (SOC), at the following time -points:  
• 30 (±7) days , 
• 90 (±10) days , and  
• 180 (±15) days .

7.5 STUDY SCHEDULE  
7.5.1 SCREENING  
• Obtain informed consent of potential participant verified by signature on study informed 
consent fo rm. 
• Verify all preliminary/screening inclusion/exclusion criteria are met . 
7.5.2 BASELINE ASSESSMENT  
• Obtain protocol -required baseline measures  
• Document medical history.  
• Perform baseline photography  
• Document concurrent medications.  
• Obtain height and weight.  
7.5.3 TREATMENT VISIT  
• Greater than 30 days between baseline and treatment visits will require that the subject be re- screened to 
confirm enrollment eligibility.  
• Perform study treatment.  
7.5.4 FOLLOW -UP 
Subjects will be asked to return to the clinic for in -person follow -up visits at 30, 90, and 180 days  post -treatment. At 
all visits, subjects will be assessed for safety and efficacy, images will be taken, adverse events and protocol 
deviations will be assessed, and study outcome measures ( Gynecomastia Grade, STPTUP, STPTIMF,  GAIS)  will be 
completed. At the 180-day follow -up appointment in addition to the above referenced assessments, the subject will 
complete a Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire.  Following study participation, the subject will be offered an optional 
balancing treatment to the side not previously treated with Renuvion.  Virtual visits are not allowed for D30, D90, 
and D180 as images and measurements are required that are not able to be completed virtually.  
7.5.5 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Adverse events  will be assessed  immediately post -treatment and at all follow -up visits . 
7.5.6 UNSCHEDULED VISITS 
Investigators may see subjects for visits in addition to the Day 30, Day 90, and D180 at their discretion. Any 
unscheduled visit or examination should be documented  in the subject’s  medical record  and adverse event form (if 
applicable) stating the reason for the visit and any actions taken. The Sponsor should be notified of the unscheduled 
visit.  
 
7.5.7 END OF STUDY  (COMPLETION ) 
All subjects who have signed an Informed Consent Form  will be considered enrolled in the study. Subjects who 
complete the study duration will be considered to have completed the study. The end of study will be defined as completion of all study visits by all enrolled subjects. If a device -related AE, SAE, or unanticipated serious device -
related effect is ongoing at the final study visit, the subject will be followed until resolution, unt il the condition 
stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  
 
A study closure visit may be conducted at the study site to  review record retention requirements, device disposition 
requirements, etc., with site personnel.  The Sponsor may choose to conduct the closure visit via telephone contact 
or online conference if appropriate.

8. ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
8.1 SPECIFICATIONS OF SAFETY PARAMETERS  
8.1.1  DEFINITION OF AN EXPECTED TREATMENT EFFECT (ETE)  AND AN ADVERSE EVENT (AE) 
An expected treatment effect is defined as any typical treatment side -effect of Renuvion APR  System of mild to 
moderate severity and lasting up to a typical maximum duration.  An  adverse event is defined as any new medical 
problem, or exacerbation of an existing problem, experienced by a subject while enrolled in the study, whether or 
not it is considered device -related by the investigator.   
 
 A preexisting condition (one that is present at the start of the study) will be recorded as an AE only if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. Neither the condition, hospitalization, 
prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an AE in the following circumstances: hospitalization or 
prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a preexisting condition. Surgery should  
not be reported as an outcome of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome 
was uneventful.  
 
All ETEs and AEs will be collected during the conduct of this trial.   
8.1.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)  
Each adverse event should be assessed for its seriousness. The definition below should be used for this assessment. 
Please note that the term serious adverse event is not synonymous with a “severe” adverse event, which may be 
used to describe the intensity of an event experienced by the subject.  
 
An adverse event should be classified as serious if it meets any of the following criteria:  
a. Death  
Death was an outcome of the adverse event.  
b. Life-threatening  
The subject was at substantial risk of dying at the time of the adverse event or  use or continued use of 
the device.  
c. Hospitalization (initial or prolonged)  
Admission to the hospital or prolongation of hospitalization was a result of the adverse event.  
d. Disability or Permanent Damage  
The adverse event resulted in a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life 
functions, i.e., the adverse event resulted in a significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the patient's body functio n/structure, physical activities and/or quality of life.  
e. Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect  
Exposure to a medical product prior to conception or during pregnancy may have resulted in an adverse outcome in the child.  
f. Required Intervention to Prevent Permanent Impairment or Damage (Devices)  
Medical or surgical intervention was necessary to preclude permanent impairment of a body function, or prevent permanent damage to a body structure, either situation suspected to be due to the use of 
a medical product.  
g. Other Serious (Important Medical Events)  
The event does not fit the other outcomes, but the event may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes.  
 
 
 
APX-21-02                                         Title: Gynecomastia Pilot Clinical Trial Protocol  
Revision: 01   Page 29 of 42 
Non -serious adverse events are all events that do not meet the criteria for a “serious” adverse event.  
8.1.3  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS (EVENTS ) 
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined as “any serious adverse effect on health or safety, or any life-
threatening problem, or death caused by, or associated with, a device; if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan, or application (including 
supplementary application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.”  
8.2 CLASSIFICATION OF AN EVENT  
8.2.1  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
Each adverse event should be assessed for its severity, or the intensity of an event experienced by the subject, using the following classifications:  
 
• Mild:  easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday 
activities. These events generally do not require treatment.  
• Moderate:  sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  These events are 
usually relieved by simple therapeutic measures.  
• Severe:   prevents normal, everyday activities.  These events may require systemic drug therapy or other 
medical treatment.  
8.2.2  RELATIONSHIP TO THE INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  
The investigators should differentiate between device and procedure related AEs by classifying events directly 
attributable to the device itself as “device related” and events that occur from the procedure, irrespective of the device, as “procedure related ”.  Since the study device delivers helium -based plasma energy to the tissue, events 
directly attributable to the application of energy to the tissue (i.e. burns) or the use of helium (i.e. gas buildup) should 
be classified as device related.  Events that are known to occur in subdermal procedures utilizing tumescent 
anesthesia and/or undermining of soft tissue (i.e. edema
17,18, hematoma18,19, nerve injury19, pain/tenderness17) 
without the use of the study device should be classified as procedure related.   The relationship to the study device and/or procedure will be determined by the investigator utilizing the following 
categories:  
• Not Related: An event for which an alternative explanation is conclusively identified –  e.g., concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is highly 
unlikely.  
• Related: The adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence related to treatment by the device 
and/or study procedure, follows a known or suspected response pattern and a plausible alternative etiology 
cannot be identified.  
• Undetermined: The relation of the adverse event has some temporal relationship to the device and/or study 
procedure, is not clearly due to another condition and the involvement of the study device is unknown.  
 
The investigator should assess the relationship of the adverse event to the investigational device. The relationship should be assessed using the categories presented in Table 6. 
TABLE 6. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADVERSE EVENTS AND INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  
Definite  Definite relationship exists between the device/procedure and an adverse event  
Probably Related  A reasonable causal relationship between the device/procedure and an adverse 
event is more likely than not.  
 
 
APX-21-02                                         Title: Gynecomastia Pilot Clinical Trial Protocol  
Revision: 01   Page 30 of 42 
Possibly Related  A reasonable relationship exists between the device/procedure and an adverse 
event, but the causal relationship is unclear or lacking.  
Not Likely Related  A temporal relationship exists between the device/procedure and an adverse 
event, but there is no reasonable causal relationship. For example,  the adverse 
event occurs in a time frame, which makes a causal relationship to device 
treatment improbable.  
Unrelated  No relationship between treatment with the device/procedure and the adverse 
event exists.  
 
8.3 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may  come to the attention of study personne l during a study visit or upon review by 
a study monitor. All ETEs and AEs will be captured on the appropriate CRF. Information  to be collected include s event 
description, date  of onset, clinician’s assessment of seriousness and s everity, relationship to study device/treatment  
(assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a determination ), actions taken, an d date of event 
resolution . All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship.  
 
A pre -existing condition should not be reported as an adverse event unless there has been a substantial increase in 
severity or frequency of the problem that has not been attributed to natural history. C hanges in the severity of an 
event will be documen ted to allow for a determination if the event should be re -categorized from an ETE to AE.   
Safety evaluations for this study include an interview with the study subject at each follow -up visit by the Investigator 
or delegated study staff to elicit information about any medical occurrence that meets the definition of Adverse 
Event. This informati on will be documented in CRF without regard for cause or relation to device and/or procedure.  
In addition, study subjects will be instructed in the Informed Consent Form, post -procedure take -home instructions, 
and verbally by study staff to report all complications experienced post study procedure to the site personnel as soon as they occur/are obs erved. Study staff will ensure that monitoring and management of all adverse events is 
prioritized.  
Study investigators are provided liberty to mitigate adverse events as deemed necessary per IHC GCP Guidelines 
E6(R2)4.3.2 which states “During and following a subject’s participation in a trial, the investigator/institution should 
ensure that adequate med ical care is provided to a subject for any adverse events related to the trial”.  
Adverse event resolution dates will be determined by investigator using either in- person or remote (phone, video 
call, text, email, etc.) examinations or communication with the subject.  To ensure the most accurate reporting of 
adverse event durations, investigators are instructed not to wait until scheduled office follow -up visits to assess 
resolution.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to determine seriousness, severity, and relatedness of the Adverse Event to the device and procedure using the definitions in this protocol.  
 
The PI will record all repo rtable events with start dates occurring any time after informed  consent is obtained until 
7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each study visit, the 
investigator will inqui re about  the occurrence of ETEs/ AEs/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for 
outcome information  until resolution or stabilization. 
8.4 REPORTING PROCEDURES  
8.4.1  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
All Adverse Events (AEs) and Expected Treatment Effects (ETEs) observed by study subjects, investigators, or other 
study staff from first exposure to the study product through last study follow -up visit will be recorded. If a device -
 
 
APX-21-02                                         Title: Gynecomastia Pilot Clinical Trial Protocol  
Revision: 01   Page 31 of 42 
related AE, ETE, SAE, or unanticipated serious device related effect is ongoing at the final study visit, the subject will 
be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is 
lost to follo w-up. The investigator should make every effort to ensure that follow- up includes any supplemental 
investigations as may be indicated to elucidate, as completely as practical, the nature and/or causality of the AE or 
SAE. This may include unscheduled follo w up visits for AE assessment.  
 
Study subjects will be instructed in the ICF, post -treatment take home instructions, and verbally by study staff to 
report all AEs to the clinical study staff.  AE information will be collected throughout the duration of the study and 
recorded on CRFs.  
 Any new medical problem, or an exacerbation of an existing condition, reported from the time the informed consent 
form is signed must be followed until the last study visit after the last study treatment or until event resolution.   
8.4.2  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Serious adverse events must be reported to the Sponsor as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours but in no 
event later than 72 hours. A ny AE  considered serio us by the  PI or Sub-investigator or which meets the defi nition 
of an S AE in cluded in De finition of Serious Adverse Event must  be documented  on an SAE CRF.   
 
The Sponsor will conduct an investigation. If the Sponsor determines that the investigation presents an unreasonable 
risk to subjects, all investigations or parts of the investigation presenting that risk will be terminated as soon as 
possible. The investi gator must report serious adverse events to the reviewing IRB according to the IRB regulations.  
 
8.4.3  UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT REPORTING  
If an unanticipated adverse device effect occurs, t he study investigator shall complete the appropriate study- specific 
CRF and submit to the stu dy sponsor and to the reviewing  IRB as  soon as possible, b ut in no event later than 10 
working days after  the investigator first learns of the effect. The study sponsor contact information is provided in 
Apyx Medical Study Contact List . The  study sponsor is responsible for conducting an evaluation of an u nanticipated 
adverse device effec t and shall report the results  of such  evaluation to FDA and to all reviewing IRBs  and partici pating 
investigators within  10 working days after the spon sor first receives notice of the effect. Thereaft er the sponsor shall 
submit such additional reports concerning the effec t as FDA requests. 
8.4.5 REPORTING OF DEATHS  
The investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours but in no event later than 
48 hours, of learning of a subject’s death, regardless of whether the death is related or unrelated to the 
investigational device. The investigator should attempt to determine, as conclusively as possible, whether the death 
is related to the device. The cause of death and the investigator’s discussion regarding whether or not the death was 
device -related should be described in a written report. The investigator mush report death to the reviewing IRB 
according to the IRB regulations at the study site.  
8.5 STUDY HALTING RULES 
This clinical trial  will be halted  if subjects’ safety is questioned based on a reporting of severe, device -related AEs at 
an excessive frequency.  The Sponsor and/or investigator may recommend termination or modification of the study 
if there is an occurrence of any device-  or treatment -related Serious Adverse Event, using the clinical protocol 
definitions of Serious Adverse Event. In addition, termi nation or modification may be recommended for any other 
perceived safety concern based on clinical judgment, including but not limited to a sev ere burn (anticipated or 
unanticipated), a higher than anticipated rate for any component of the safety measures, device failures resulting in Adverse Events, or unexpected SAEs. T he study sponsor will notify all investigators to immediately halt  any 
 
 
APX-21-02                                         Title: Gynecomastia Pilot Clinical Trial Protocol  
Revision: 01   Page 32 of 42 
continuing enrollment activities and not enroll any additional  study partici pants.  The study sponsor will inform the 
IRB/ FDA of the temporary halt and the di sposition of the study. 
 
The Sponsor and/or investigator may recommend termination or modification of the study if there is an occurrence 
of any device - or treatment -related Serious Adverse Event, using the clinical protocol definitions of Serious Adverse 
Event. In addition, termination or modification may be recommended for any other perce ived safety concern based 
on clinical judgment, including but not limited to a severe burn (anticipated or unanticipated), a higher than 
anticipated rate for any component of the safety measures, device failures resulting in Adverse Events, or unexpected S AEs. Enrollment and treatment would be suspended during root cause investigation to determine the 
cause of the respective AE.  
9. CLINICAL MONITORING  
Clinical site  monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well-being of human subjects are protected, that 
the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifia ble, and that the conduc t of the trial is in compliance with 
the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with G CP, and  with a pplicable regulatory requirement(s ).

13.2  INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD  
Prior to initiation of any study procedures, the protocol, informed consent, and re cruitment materials, and all 
participant materials will be submitted to a duly constituted IRB for view and approval. In addition, any amendments 
to the protocol or Informed Consent Form will be reviewed and approved by the IRB. The Sponsor must receive a 
letter documenting IRB approval at the clinical si te prior to the initiation of the study.  
 
The investigator is responsible for providing the appropriate reports to its reviewing IRB during the course of the 
clinical study. These reports will include:  
• Informing the IRB of the study progress periodically as required, but at least annually.  
• Reporting any unanticipated adverse device effects within 10 working days of first learning of the event . 
• Reporting any deviations from the clinical protocol to protect the life or well -being of a subject in the case 
of an emergency within five working days after the emergency occurred . 
• Reporting the use of the device without obtaining informed consent from a subject within five working days 
of the event . 
• Providing any other reports requested by the IRB.  
The IRB must be notified of study completion within 30 days of the final visit of the last subject and should be 
provided with a summary of the results of the study by the investigator.  
13.3 PARTICIPANT AND DATA CONFIDENTIALITY  
All information generated in this study must be considered highly confidential and must not be disclosed to any 
persons not directly concerned with the study without prior written permission from the Sponsor. Authorized regulatory officials and Sponsor per sonnel (or its representatives) will be allowed full access to inspect the records.
 
Data disclosed outside the study team will be de -identified or will only include general group demographic 
information. Protected Health Information and/or identifiable stu dy data will not be shared with anyone outside the 
study team or Health System, with the exception of the study sponsor, and federal regulators/ institutional officials 
for the purposes of auditing.  
 
All investigational devices and/or other materials collected will be used solely in accordance with this protocol, 
unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Sponsor.  
 
Subjects should be identified only by initials and unique subject numbers on study specific CRFs . If necessary, their 
full names may be made known to a regulatory agency or other authorized officials.  Information to be stored on the 
computer will be identified by subject ID and will be password protected.  
14. DATA  HANDLING  AND  RECORD  KEEPING 
14.1 DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at t he site under t he supervision of the site PI. The  
investigator is  responsible for ensu ring the accur acy, completeness,  legibility, and timeline ss of the data repo rted.

Revision: 01   Page 34 of 42 
 
During each subject’s visit to the clinic, study data will be documented by study personnel on study- specific Case 
Report Forms  (CRFs) prior to entry into an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.  Subject demographic information, 
procedural data, adverse events, device observations, and study required assessments will be documented on the 
CRFs  by delegated site personnel .  In addition, study personnel will record progress notes to document all significant 
observations, and any contact with a subject by telephone or other means that provides significant clinical 
information will also be documented in the progress notes as described above.  In this clinical trial, study specific  
CRFs  may serve as source documents.  
 
For transmission to the Sponsor, information from the study progress notes and other source documents will be promptly transcribed to study specific CRF to the EDC with the CRF attached for remote monitoring of the data.  
Transcription of study data onto study specific  CRFs and entry into the EDC  should be completed within 3 days of 
the study visit.  
 Copies of the electronic CRF (eCRF) serving  as source documents must be maintained for each participant enrolled in 
the study. Data reported in the eCRF derived from source documents should be consistent with the source documents 
or the discrepancies should be explained and captured in a progress note and maintained in the participant’s official 
electronic study record. 
 Any changes to information in the study progress notes, other source documents, and CRFs  will be initialed and 
dated in ink on the day the change is made by a site study staff member authorized to make the change. Changes will be made by striking a single line through erroneous data, and clearly entering the correct data. If the reason for 
the change is not apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written in the source documentation by the 
investigator and/or delegated staff . 
 Data management and oversight is the responsibility of the Sponsor.  Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:   
• Clinical strategy and oversight . 
• Clinical study operations . 
• File management and study documentation.  
• Site initiation visits and study close -out visits .

15. STUDY  ADMINISTRATION   
 
 
APX-21-02                                         Title: Gynecomastia Pilot Clinical Trial Protocol  
Revision: 01   Page 37 of 42 
15.1  STUDY INVESTIGATORS  
Participating Investigators will be qualified based on professionals experienced in treatment of gynecomastia and 
skin laxity, such as plastic or cosmetic surgeons.  Investigators will be selected based on interest and availability for 
participation in the study; ability to provide qualified subjects; adequate support staff; experience conducting clinical 
research; and willingness  to comply with the protocol, IRB requirements, regulatory requirements (including the 
signed investigator agreement and statemen ts disclosing any financial relationship investigators might have with 
Apyx Medical Corporation), and applicable regulations.  
15.2 AMENDMENT POLICY  
The investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without prior written consent from the Sponsor and 
subsequent approval by the IRB, except if the deviation from the protocol is necessary to protect the life and physical 
well-being of a subject i n an emergency. Such protocol deviations must be reported to the Sponsor and the reviewing 
IRB as soon as possible, but no later than five working days after the emergency occurred.  
 
 Any permanent change to the protocol, whether it is an overall change or a change for specific study center(s), must 
be handled as a protocol amendment. Any amendment to the protocol that appears indicated as the study 
progresses will be fully discussed b y the investigator(s) and the Sponsor. If agreement is reached regarding the need 
for an amendment, the Sponsor will write it. The written amendment must be submitted to the chairman of the IRB identified with this responsibility. Except for “administrativ e amendments”, investigators must await IRB approval 
of protocol amendments before implementing the change(s). Administrative amendments are defined to have no 
effect on the validity of the data or information resulting from the completion of the approved protocol, or the 
relationship of likely patient risk to benefit relied upon to approve the protocol; the scientific soundness of the investigational plan or protocol; and the right, safety or welfare of the human subjects involved in the investigation.  
When, in judgment of the chairman of the IRB, the investigators and/or the Sponsor, the amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject, the currently approved written Informed Consent Form will require similar modification. In such cases, repeat informed consent will be obtained 
from subjects enrolled in the study before continued participation.  
16. CONFLICT  OF INTEREST  POLICY  
The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence is critical. Therefore, any actual conflict of interest of 
persons who have a role in the design, conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial will be disclosed and 
managed. Furthermore, persons who have a perceived conflict of interest will be required to have such conflicts managed 
in a way that is appropriate to their participation in the trial. The study leadership has established policies and proced ures 
for all study group members to disclose all conflicts of interest and will establish a mech anism for the managemen t of all 
reported dualities of interest.

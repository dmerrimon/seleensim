Version 3.0  CLINICAL STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Multiple Ascending 
Dose Study of Intravenous ATYR1923 in Patients with Pulmonary 
Sarcoidosis 
Protocol Number:  ATYR1923-C-002 
Study Phase:  1b/2a 
Investigators / Study Centers:  This multicenter study will be conducted at approximately  18 study 
centers  globally. 
Study Objectives:  Primary  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending intravenous (IV) doses of ATYR1923 in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.  
Secondary 
• To assess the potential steroid -sparing effect of multiple 
ascending doses of ATYR1923 in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.  
• To assess the potential immunogenicity of multiple ascending IV doses of ATYR1923 in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.  
• To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple 
ascending IV doses of ATYR1923 in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.  
Exploratory 
• To explore the preliminary efficacy of multiple ascending IV doses of ATYR1923 in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis by evaluating changes over time in: 
- Disease activity (pulmonary parenchymal inflammation), assessed by 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron- emission 
tomography combined with computed tomography (
18F-FDG -PET/CT)  (optional) . 
- Lung function, assessed by percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%)  and diffusing capacity of the lungs for 
carbon monoxide (DL
CO). 
- Serum biomarkers, including angiotensin converting 
enzyme (ACE), soluble IL- 2 receptor (sIL -2R), 
extracellular histidyl- tRNA -synthetase, neuropilin 2 
(NRP2), and vascular endothelial growth factor C 
(VEGFC).

Version 3.0  - State of immune cell anergy in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs)  
- Health -related quality of life scales, including the 
Sarcoidosis Assessment Tool (SAT), King’s Sarcoidosis Questionnaire (KSQ), Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ), Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), and the self -
administered computerized Baseline/Transitional Dyspnea Indices (SAC BDI -TDI).  
- Skin lesions, for patients with cutaneous disease involvement at baseline, as assessed by Ski n Physician 
Global Assessment (SPGA), body surface area (BSA) assessment, and the Sarcoidosis Activity and Severity 
Index (SASI ; on a target lesion ), as well as serial biopsies 
of non- target lesion(s) (optional at select sites).  
Study Design:  This randomi zed, double-blind, placebo- controlled, study will evaluate 
the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, and preliminary efficacy of multiple ascending doses of IV ATYR1923 in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis undergoing a protocol- guided oral corticoste roid 
(OCS) tapering regimen.  
This study will consist of 3 staggered multiple dose cohorts. Each 
eligible patient will participate in only one cohort during the study. Within each cohort, 12 patients will be randomized 2:1 (block size of 6) to ATYR1923 (N= 8) or placebo (N=4). Study drug will be 
administered via IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 6  doses 
(20 weeks of treatment). The follow -up study visit is scheduled for 
4 weeks after the last infusion. The ATYR1923 doses levels to be evaluated are 1.0  mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, and 5.0 mg/kg.  
Day 1 is the calendar day of first infusion.  
Starting on Day 15, patients will begin a taper (reduction) in OCS (per the ATYR1923-C-002 Oral Corticosteroid Taper Guidelines) from 
their starting dose of 10-25 mg/day of pre dnisone (or equivalent) to a 
target dose of 5 mg/day, to be completed on or before Day 50. The 
OCS dose will be tapered by 5.0 mg/day every 1 to 2 weeks, depending on the starting dose. Smaller incremental titrations to the target dose of 5 mg/day by Day 5 0 may be implemented per Investigator judgement. 
Patients will be maintained at the target dose of 5.0  mg/day (or 
equivalent) through Week 24/End-of-Study (EOS). Optionally, further titrations in the OCS dose to below 5 mg/day may be attempted after 
the Week 16 visit , if determined by the Investigator to be feasible. 
Patients who develop an acute worsening of symptoms or are unable to adhere to the protocol- defined OCS tapering regimen may receive 
‘rescue’ treatment with higher OCS doses as clinically indicated. Upon 
resolution of symptoms, the Investigator may choose to reinstitute a 
taper back down to the target maintenance dose of 5 mg/day. Patients

Version 3.0  who require rescue treatment following two attempts at tapering to 
5 mg/day may remain on a higher stable dose of OCS as determined by 
the Investigator. Patients who require an increase in OCS dose at any time in the study should continue to receive blinded study drug and followed through to the end of the study. It is planned that 36 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis will be randomized into one of 3 sequential 
cohorts, each comprising 12 patients allocated 2:1 (block size of 6) to 
ATYR1923:Placebo. 
 Planned Dose Cohorts  
The planned dose cohorts are as follows:

Safety Monitoring  
Ongoing review of blinded safety and tolerability data will be performed by the Medical Monitor and aTyr Pharma personnel.  
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will perform 
interim reviews of unblinded safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data to review and approve dose escalation to the next highest dose cohort (see Dose Escalatio n) and ad hoc as per Sponsor request if a 
pattern of unexpected, clinically significant trends or changes in other safety assessments is identified through blinded safety data reviews.  
Dose Escalation  
Cohorts 1 through 3 will be enrolled sequentially in a staggered manner. After at least 6 patients of a given cohort have received at least 3 infusions of study drug (ATYR1923 or placebo), cumulative unblinded safety data (including but not limited to any reported adverse 
events (AEs), electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, clinical lab oratory 
values and vital signs) will be reviewed by the DSMB. Enrollment in 
the next scheduled (higher dose) cohort may commence after this review is completed, dose escalation is approved, and the remaining 6 patients have been randomized in the previous cohort. Dose escalation 
will continue in this manner until the highest planned dose level of ATYR1923 is reached, or the criteria for pausing enrollment have been met.  
Criteria for Pausing Enrollment  
In the event that a serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction 
(SUSAR) has occurred, the enrollment and initiation of study drug

Version 3.0  administration to new patients will be paused and the Sponsor will 
request an unblinded review by the DSMB, who will provide its 
recommendation to aTyr Pharma. Such recommendation may include, but is not limited to, stopping an ongoing cohort, stopping further dose escalation, continuing the study as planned, or continuing the study with modifications, such as evaluation of a lower or intermediate dose 
in the next cohort(s) to gain more information on safety and 
tolerability.  
In addition, if unexpected, clinically significant trends or changes in other safety assessments are identified during routine blinded safety reviews the Sponsor may request the DSMB to similarly perform an unblinded review and provide recommendations.  
Number of Patients Planned:  It is planned that 36 adult patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis will be randomized into one of 3 sequential cohort. Patients who withdraw for reasons o ther than treatment -related AEs may be replaced at the 
discretion of the Sponsor.

diastolic, recorded after lying supine for 5 min), heart rate, respiratory rate. Temperature is to be obtained at Screening and on dosing days at pre-dose, 60 minutes (±15 minutes) 
after the SOI, and again at 4 hours (±15 minutes)  after the SOI.  
4. Pulse oximetry: continuous pulse oximetry is to be measured on dosing days from 5 minutes pre -dose until EOI, and recorded at the same time points as vital signs. On non-
dosing days pulse oximetry is to be obtained with vital sign assessments.  
5. 12-lead ECG  is to be obtained at Screening, within 1 -hour pre-dose on dosing days. At Day 1 and Weeks 12 and 20, an ECG is to be obtained at 4 hours (±30 minutes) after 
SOI. The ECG is to be obtained after patients have been lying supine for 5 minutes.  
6. Pulmonary Function Testing is to be performed using the sa me spirometer throughout the study. Parameters include forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume 
in 1 second (FEV 1), FEV 1/FVC ratio at all specified visits. A minimum of 3 efforts should be obtained that meet the acceptance criteria of the American Thoracic Society or  
European Respiratory Society .  
7. DL CO measurements should be obtained after patients have been sitting quietly for 5 minutes.  
8. Pregnancy  serum tests are to be performed on all females at Screening and at Week 24/EOS. A uri ne pregnancy test is to be performed at other time points indicated.  
9. FSH only required for all female patients.  
10. Urinalysis  (semi -quantitative by dipstick): microscopy is to be performed if indicated by an abnormal and clinically significant result.  
11. Serum Complement, Tryptase/Plasma Complement,  and IgE are to be collected at Day 1 pre-dose and again if an infusion related reaction (IRR) occurs. 
12. 18F-FDG -PET/CT scan s are optional ; patients who elect to participate  agree to have imaging perfor med within 4 weeks prior to Day 1,  and within ±5 days of Week 16 or if 
early termination prior to Week 16. 
13. Skin lesion evaluation: To be completed for patients with skin lesions present. Skin lesions will be evaluated by: Skin Physician Global Assessm ent (SPGA), body surface 
Area assessment, the Sarcoidosis Activity and Severity Index (SASI).  
14. Skin lesion biopsy:  Optional for patients with skin lesions present. A  non-target lesion (ie, a lesion that is not being assessed by SASI  over time) is to be selected by the 
Investigator for biopsy during Screening and confirmed by the patient that it had been identified by his or her private derma tologist as cutaneous sarcoidosis. Skin lesion biopsy 
may be obtained within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 for patients who are otherwise deemed eligible for the study and within ± 5 days of Week 12 or if early termination prior to 
Week 12.  
15. Randomization  is to be performed within 0-3 days prior to Day 1 or on the day of dosing.  
16. ATYR1923 serum PK  samples are to be collected pre-dose on dosing days. On Day 1 and Week 20 visits, PK samples are also collected post start of infusion at: 1 hr (just 
prior to [i.e., within 0-10 minutes] EOI), and at any single time point between 4-6 hours.  
17. ADA samples are to be collected p re-dose when obtained on dosing days.  
18. Blood for PBMC assessments will be collected pre -dose when obtained on dosing days.  
19. Serum for biomarkers are to be collected pre-dos e when obtained on dosing days.  
20. Infusion site examination: the IV infusion site should be examined at 0.5 and 1.5 hours  (+10 minutes)  after the end of infusion.  
21. OCS Taper: OCS taper to start at Day 15 (Week 2) and continue through Day 50 (Week 7) per the ATYR1923-C-002 OCS Taper Guideline.

Version 3.0  2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1. Pulmonary Sarcoidosis  
Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a form of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in which immune cells 
play a predominant role. Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP), polymyositis/dermatomyositis ILD (PM/DM -ILD), and connective tissue disease 
associated ILD (rheumatoid arthritis ILD; systemic sclerosis -associated ILD) are 
examples of other immune-mediate ILDs. These lung conditions are recognized as having a measurable i mmune component involving both innate and adaptive immune 
mechanisms that contribute to pathogenesis at several cellular and non- cellular levels 
(Kolahian et al, 2016; Meyer et al, 2014).  
Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology that is characterized pathologically by the presence of non -caseating granulomas ( Hunninghake 
et al, 1999). Sarcoidosis frequently presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltration, and ocular and skin lesions. This disease affects people of all ages, but typically presents before the age of 50 years, with the incidence peaking at 20-39 years ( Iannuzzi et al, 2007). The lungs are affected in more than 90% of patients with 
sarcoidosis ( Baughman et al, 2011). Although spontaneous remissions occur, chronic or 
progressive disease is seen in 10–30% and the disease is fatal in 15% of patients, typically due to progressive respiratory insufficiency, central nervous system, or myocardial involvement. The liver, spleen, lymph nodes, salivary glands, heart, nervous system, muscles, bones, and other organs may also be involved. While sarcoidosis most frequently involves the lungs and thoracic lymph nodes, up to 30 percent of patients present with extrathoracic manifestations of sarcoidosis.  
In the lung, granulomas are most commonly found in the alveolar septa, the walls of bronchi, the pulmonary arteries and veins. The sarcoid granuloma is characterized by a core of monocy te-derived epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleate giant cells with 
interspersed CD4+ T lymphocytes ( Baughman et al, 2011). A minority of cells in or near 
the granuloma are CD8+ lymphocytes, fibroblasts, regulatory T- cells, and B 
lymphocytes. 
For p atients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, the primary goal of treatment is to improve the 
patient’s quality of life, while secondarily managing the inflammation that could lead to 
the development of more permanent fibrosis and impairment of pulmonary function. Currently, the only available therapy, H.P. Acthar
® Gel, ( Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, 
2018) for the treatment of sarcoidosis, which was approved in 1952, is not widely used by physicians due to toxicity and cost issues ( Baughman et al, 2016). The consensus 
standard of care is oral corticosteroids (OCS) that act mainly by suppressing inflammatory genes including interferon gamma (IFN -γ) and tumor necrosis factor- alpha 
(TNF -α), which are important to sarcoid granuloma development ( Schutt et al, 
2010, Judson et al, 2012 ). OCS therapy has been shown to stabilize or improve the

Version 3.0  diseas e, although relapse commonly occurs once OCS therapy is tapered or discontinued 
(Iannuzzi et al, 2007). Current consensus recommends initiating treatment at a daily 
prednisone equivalent dose of 20 - 40 mg/day for 1 to 3 months, followed by a taper to 
5 to 10 mg/day maintenance dose for 1 year ( Hunninghake et al, 1999). For patients who 
subsequently relapse after taper or discontinuation of OCS therapy, the cycle of dosing is repeated.  
Long -term corticosteroid use is associated with significant side effects, including 
substantial weight gain, development of insulin resistance, osteoporosis, and risk of infection. As well, a cohort of sarcoidosis experts published a consensus that a maintenance dose of greater than 10  mg/day  for pulmonary sarcoidosis was to be 
avoided, when possible ( Hunninghake et al, 1999), forming the need for steroid- sparing 
treatments. Yet, unremitting inflammation may progress into pulmonary fibrosis and death. Alternatives, such as immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents (eg, methotrexate and TNF-α inhibitors) have been used; however, these therapies can also have significant side effects and toxicities. ( Judson et al, 2012). Most published data on the use of these 
therapies is anecdotal and based on small numbers of patients and results have been 
variable. Infliximab (TNF -α inhibitor) was shown to improve lung function in those with 
chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis; however, the treatment effect was modest ( Baughman et 
al, 2006).  
Given the known toxicities of long-term corticosteroids, immunosuppressives and cytotoxic therapeutic regimens, treatment of patients with sarcoidosis is limited to those who are symptomatic and whose disease is considered ‘active’. The presence of granulomas from sarcoidosis define the disease as active ( Beegle et al, 2013 ), and 
granulomatous inflammation is the major cause of fibrosis in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Studies to date have not clear ly demonstrated that corticosteroids or other immuno-
suppressive therapy prevents disease progression or formation of fibrosis ( Baughman et 
al, 2011). Therefore, there exists a substantial need for safer and more effective therapies for sarcoidosis. 
2.2. ATYR1923 
The immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis is not yet well understood. A leading hypothesis is that granuloma formation involves the interplay between antigen, human leukocyte antigen class II molecules, and T- cell receptors ( Moller et al, 2002) : a presumptive 
sarcoid ‘antigen’ is engulfed by circulating antigen -presenting cells (APCs; macrophages, 
dendritic cells) and the subsequent interplay between APCs and CD4+ T cells initiates granuloma formation ( Baughman et al, 2011). T lymphocyte activation subsequently 
plays a crucial role in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. The T -cell response is biased towards a 
Th-1 phenotype, with important roles for interferon- gamma (IFN -γ) and IL-12 
(Baughman et al, 2011). A variety of cytokines and chemokines have been associated 
with the granulomatous response in sarcoidosis, including TNF-α. Recently, TH17

Version 3.0  effector CD4+ cells have been implicated in sarcoidosis granuloma formation ( Facco et 
al, 2011).  
ATYR1923 is a novel molecular entity that acts as an extracellular immunomodulator. 
ATYR1923 comprises a human 59 amino acid protein (iMod) fused to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). The amino acid sequence of the 59 amino acid iMod domain in ATYR1923 corresponds identically to the extracellularly active iMod domain of histidyl -tRNA synthetase (HARS) amino acids 2 to 60 (HARS 2- 60). In solution, the 
ATYR1923 molecule forms a homodimer, similar to other Fc fusion proteins. 
ATYR1923 development builds upon aTyr’s (Sponsor’s) understanding of the biology of 
the extracellular activity of HARS, which we refer to as the neuropilin 2 (NRP2) pathway. Antibody blockade of the NRP2 pathway has been associated with disruption of immune, respiratory, and muscle homeostasis both in animals ( Fernandez et al, 
2013; Katsumata et al, 2007 ; Sciorati et al, 2014; Sciorati et al, 2015; Hervier et al, 2016 ) 
and in humans. In humans, the rare disease, anti- synthetase syndrome is associated with 
loss of immune tolerance to HARS, with resultant Jo -1 antibody (Ab) that recognizes 
HARS ( Mathews and Berstein, 1983; Bernstein et al, 1984; Yoshida et al, 1983; Yang et 
al, 1984; Stone et al, 2007; Tillie -Leblond et al, 2008; Richards et al, 2009 ). These 
patients commonly manifest with myositis and ILD, and the Sponsor has determined that all Jo -1 Ab -positive patients tested have antibodies that bind to the iMod domain.  
ATYR19 23 may provide a naturally occurring human immunomodulatory function to 
therapeutically control or balance the human immune system. The mechanism of action of ATYR1923 in T-cells overlaps with the cellular pathology observed in lung sarcoidosis. In nonclinical studies, ATYR1923 has been shown to inhibit cytokines involved in regulation of inflammatory and immune responses and attenuate T- cell 
activation ( Mertsching et al, 2018). As NRP2 was recently discovered to bind 
ATYR1923, and innate immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages are known to express NRP2 ( Roy et al, 2017; Schellenburg et al, 2017), further research into the 
interaction between ATYR1923 and NRP2 on these cells could potentially elucidate additional mechanism through which ATYR1923 modulates the immune system. Finally, ATYR1923 has been shown to significantly reduce lung fibrosis and inflammation in bleomycin -induced animal models of ILD ( Nangle et al , 2017; Ogilvie et al, 2018).  
To date, 25 healthy adult subjects have been exposed to ATYR1923 at doses ranging from 0.03 to 5.0 mg/kg in a first- in-human clinical study, ATYR1923-C-001. Data from 
this study demonstrated single doses of ATYR1923 over the dosing range of 0.03 to 5 mg/kg to be well-tolerated in healthy volunteers No severe treatment- emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), or TEAEs leading to study drug modification (dose reduction or discontinuation) were reported. No apparent dose relationship was seen across the range of doses studies with regard to the incidence of TEAEs. Adverse reactions reported to date include headache, dizziness, and back pain.

Version 3.0  No ATYR1923- treated subject experienced a definitive infusion -related reaction (IRR). 
However, the occurrence of an IRR could not be ruled out for 1 subject, who experienced 
mild, transient symptoms of dizziness, abdominal pain, and “feeling cold” followed by back pain after ATYR1923 infusion. No subject was positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) or Jo -1 Ab after ATYR1923 exposure. 
ATYR1923 pharmacokinetics (PK) were dose-proportional over the range of 0.03 mg/kg to 5.0 mg/kg, and the mean half- life (t
1/2) was  consistent at doses of 0.1 mg/kg and above, 
with mean values ranging from 167 to 242 hours (7 to 10 days), supporting the potential for convenient dosing on a monthly basis. 
This study represents the first clinical investigation of ATYR1923 in patients with 
pulmonary sarcoidosis. 
2.3. Rationale for Current Study  
A large unmet need exists for a new therapy that can safely and effectively treat pulmonary sarcoidosis, a condition for which t here exists a substantial need for safer and 
more effective therapies . The first-in-human clinical study of ATYR1923 demonstrated 
ATYR1923 to be well tolerated among healthy volunteers, with no significant safety concerns identified. Furthermore, PK data support convenient once monthly (QM) dosing. Accordingly, the current study is being conducted to determine the safety and tolerability, potential steroid -sparing effect, potential immunogenicity, and PK of 
ATYR1923 in this target patient population. The potential efficacy of ATYR1923 will also be preliminarily explored in this s tudy.

Version 3.0  4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, study will evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, and preliminary efficacy of multiple ascending doses 
of IV ATYR1923 in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis undergoing a protocol-guided OCS tapering regimen.  
This study will consist of 3 staggered multiple dose cohorts, as shown in Table 2 . 
Table 2: Planned Dose Cohorts 
Cohort  Dose 
(mg/kg)  # of Doses  Dosing 
Frequency  N Ratio ATYR1923: Placebo  
1 1.0 6 Every 4 weeks  12 2:1 
2 3.0 6 Every 4 weeks  12 2:1 
3 5.0 6 Every 4 weeks  12 2:1 
 
Each eligible patient will participate in only one cohort during the study. Within each 
cohort, 12 patients will be randomized 2:1 (block size of 6) to ATYR1923 (N=8) or 
placebo (N=4). Study drug will be administered via IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 6 doses (20 weeks of treatment). The follow-up study visit is scheduled for 4 weeks after the last infusion. The ATYR1923 doses levels to be evaluated are 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg, and 5.0 mg/kg. In total, approximately 36 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis are planned to be randomized. The dose-escalation procedure is described in Section 7.1.3.1. 
Day 1 is the calendar day of fi rst infusion.  
Starting on Day 15, patients will begin a taper (reduction) in OCS (per the ATYR1923-C-
002 Oral Corticosteroid Taper Guidelines) from their starting dose of 10- 25 mg/day of 
prednisone (or equivalent) to a target dose of 5 mg/day, to be completed on or before Day 50. The OCS dose will be tapered by 5.0 mg/day every 1 to 2 weeks, depending on 
the starting dose. Smaller incremental titrations to the target dose of 5  mg/day by Day 50 
may be implemented per Investigator judgement. Patients will be  maintained at the target 
dose of 5.0 mg/day (or equivalent) through Week 24/End-of-Study (EOS). Optionally, further titrations in the OCS dose to below 5 mg/day may be attempted  after the Week 16 
visit, if determined by the Investigator to be feasible.  
Patients who develop an acute worsening of symptoms or are unable to adhere to the 
protocol- defined OCS tapering regimen may receive ‘rescue’ treatment with higher OCS 
doses as clinically indicated. Upon resolution of symptoms, the Investigator may choose to reinstitute a taper back down to the target maintenance dose of 5 mg/day. Patients who 
require rescue treatment following 2 attempts at tapering to 5  mg/day may remain on a

Version 3.0  higher stable dose of OCS, as determined by the Investigator. Patients who require an 
increase in OCS dose at any time in the study should continue to receive blinded study 
drug and followed through to the end of the study. 
Ongoing review of blinded safety and tolerability data will be performed by the Medical 
Monitor and aTyr Pharma personnel. 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will perform interim reviews of 
unblinded safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data from each cohort and ad hoc as per Sponsor’s request if a pattern of unexpected, clinically significant trends or changes in other safety assessments is identified through blinded safety data reviews. 
4.1.1. Screening Period  
Patients will report to the study center for the eligibility screening (see Section  5) for 
inclusion and exclusion criteria) within 28 days prior to (the first) drug administration.  
Patients will sign the study -specific informed consent form (ICF) prior to any 
study-specific screening procedures being performed. The written informed consent will 
be obta ined for all patients, regardless of their eligibility for the study, and a copy will be 
provided to the patient.  
Eligibility screening will consist of the assessments as presented in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1).  
4.1.2. Treatment Period  
The treatment period consists of 6 administrations of study drug via IV infusion every 4 weeks for a total of 20 weeks of treatment (at Day 1 and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20). Study drug will be administered by qualified study ce nter personnel at scheduled study 
visits.  
Between scheduled study visits, patients will be contacted by study center personnel via telephone at Weeks 1, 3, 5-7, 10, 14, and 18. 
Assessments during the treatment period will be performed as presented in the S chedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ). 
4.1.3. Follow- up 
All patients are to attend an End -of-Study (EOS) visit at Week 24, ie, 1 month after the 
last study drug dose. Note that patients with elevated confirmed positive Jo -1 antibody 
titers or who have ongoing study drug- related TEAEs at Week 24/EOS will continue to 
be followed until resolution or determined by the Investigator to be stable (eg, by 
telephone contact or unscheduled visit). 
Assessments during follow-up will be performed as presented in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1).

Version 3.0  4.1.4. Study Completion 
The study will be considered complete when the last patient completes the EOS visit and 
any necessary follow -up for Jo-1 Ab positivity or ongoing study drug- related TEAEs has 
been completed.  
4.2. Discussion of Study Design  
Single doses of ATYR1923 were found to be safe and well tolerated in a first- in-human 
clinical study, ATYR1923-C-001, in healthy volunteers. No significant immunogenic responses (induction of ADAs or Jo-1 Ab positivity) were observed following the 
administration of single doses of ATYR1923. The PK of ATYR1923 was well characterized and demonstrated dose-proportional exposures over the range of doses from 0.03 to 5 mg/kg fol lowing IV drug administration. Terminal elimination phases were 
parallel, and the mean t
1/2 was consistent from the 0.1 mg/kg (Cohort 2) onwards, with 
mean values ranging from 167 to 242 hours, supporting the potential for dosing every 4 weeks.  
These data support the continued clinical evaluation of ATYR1923, including evaluations of the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and potential efficacy of multiple doses of ATYR1923. ATYR1923 is being developed for pulmonary sarcoidosis, a condition with a  significant unmet medical need. Given the significant unmet medical need for this 
condition, advancing safe and efficacious therapies to patients as rapidly as possible is warranted.  
Several design features have been employed in the current study in an e ffort to minimize 
bias, including a double-blind design. Within each cohort, patients will be randomized, on a 2:1 basis, to receive either ATYR1923 or placebo. Random assignment of patients avoids bias and helps ensure that both known and unknown risk fac tors are distributed 
evenly between treatment groups. The use of placebo control permits prospective comparison between the ATYR1923 groups and the control group.  
This study will be conducted at multiple -study centers. This multi- center design is needed 
not only for efficient enrollment of the required number of patients, allowing for a more 
efficient evaluation of ATYR1923, but it provides a better basis for the subsequent generalization of study findings ( ICH E9, Statistical Principals for Clinical Trials, 1998 ). 
The current study is specifically designed, with the inclusion of detailed safety measures, to evaluate these parameters in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.  
Patients will be evaluated routinely during the treatme nt as well as 4 weeks after the last 
study drug dose.  The development of humoral immune responses (formation of Ab) to exogenously 
administered proteins occurs commonly. ATYR1923 is a protein- based therapeutic; 
specifically, it is a human 59 -amino acid protein (ie, iMod) directly fused to the C-

Version 3.0  terminus Fc region of human IgG1, and exists as an Fc fusion dimer. The 
immunogenicity assessments in the single -dose healthy subject study included 
assessment of both ADA and Jo-1 Ab, the Ab that recognizes HARS, w ith lo ss of 
immune tolerance to HARS being associated with anti-synthetase syndrome. In the single -dose healthy volunteer study, neither Jo-1 Ab or ADA were detected. However, 
ADA have occurred infrequently in nonclinical studies with ATYR1923 in the rat and non-human primate (NHP). ADA did not affect the PK of the drug. Thus, ADAs may be observed in the current clinical study. Accordingly, the study design includes ADA and Jo-1 Ab testing, detailed clinical monitoring for adverse immunological events, exte nded 
safety follow -up if indicated to follow-up on serological findings, and a specific plan to 
assist Investigators in the clinical management of patients in whom immunogenicity occurs (see Section 9.9).  
The Investigator will take all the usual medical safety precautions necessary for studies at an early stage in the development of a new drug and has full discretion to stop study drug infusion at any time, if clinically warranted, or otherwise in the patient’s  best interest 
(Section 6.4).

Version 3.0  6. STUDY CONDUCT  
6.1. Patient Identification, Enrollment, and Randomization  
After obtaining informed consent, patients will be screened according to the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. Patients will be assigned to a cohort based on their availability. 
Patients who have met all eligibility criteria will receive a unique screening number accordin g to the screening order. Then, prior to dosing, each patient will be allocated a 
randomization number according to their chronological order of inclusion in the study. This number will correspond to a treatment (ATYR1923 or placebo) as specified on the pre-determined randomization schedule.  
The master randomization schedule will be made of randomly permuted blocks of 
appropriate sizes, as determined by the unblinded study team member producing the schedule. The schedule will be generated electronically.  
For patients who are replaced, the replacements should take the same treatment 
assignment as the original patient to ensure that the treatment groups stay balanced.  
The randomization code will be produced within the interactive web response system (IWRS). T he study center pharmacist or designated unblinded study team member will be 
provided access to the randomization code within the IWRS. The laboratory where the PK samples are to be analyzed will also be provided access to distinguish between samples of patients dosed with ATYR1923 versus placebo. 
Patients who withdraw for any reason without completing all screening evaluations 
successfully, will be considered “screen failures”. Such patients will have a limited number of electronic case report forms (eCRFs ) completed.  
6.2. Patient Management  
All patients must provide written informed consent before the performance of any study-related procedure. Patients eligible for the study will be randomized into the study 0-
3 days prior to Day  1 and will receive a total of  6 IV infusions of study drug (either 
ATYR1923 or placebo) administered once every 4- weeks, according to their treatment 
assignment on a double- blind basis. Patients will attend a p ost-treatment follow -up visit 
4 weeks after completion of dosing. 
6.3. Patient A dherence  
All patients are required to adhere to the protocol-specified dosing and visit schedules. If a patient misses a scheduled visit, attempts should be made to reschedule the visit within the visit windows specified in Table 1. Failure to attend scheduled study visits may result in discontinuation from the study.

Version 3.0  6.3.1. Study Conduct During the COVID -19 Public Health Emergency  
Note that due to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID- 19) public health emergency, it is 
understood that some flexibility may be required around the timing of scheduled study 
visits beyond the visit windows specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). In 
particular , the 4-week Screening period may be extended to 6 weeks, laboratory or 
clinical tests may be pe rformed locally , and telephone contacts may be utilized to follow 
patients with delayed or missed study visits .  
Patients missing 2 consecutive study drug doses are to have study drug permanent ly 
discontinued, complete the EOS visit, and be withdrawn from the study. (Patients who withdraw from the study due to COVID-19- related issues may be replaced; see Section 
6.4.3.) 
Note that COVID -19 screening is  not required per protocol; however, each study center is 
to follow standard institutional practice regarding COVID -19. 
All deviations due to COVID-19 are to be documented. 
6.4. Withdrawal and Replacement of Patients  
6.4.1. Study Drug Discontinuation Criteria  
Study dr ug must be discontinued if any of the following events occur: 
• A serious adverse event (SAE) during or within 60 minutes of IV infusion that 
includes cardiac and/or respiratory observations, that has a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship with th e study drug, including a severe IRR. 
• Pregnancy . 
• Patient request to discontinue study drug dosing for any reason. 
• Other findings that, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or Sponsor, indicate that study drug administration should be discontinued. 
• Missing 2 consecutive study drug doses. 
The Investigator has full discretion to stop study drug infusion at any time, if clinically warranted or in the patient’s best interest.  
All patients who have been dosed with any amount of study drug will continue to be followed for safety. Patients who discontinue study drug dosing at any time during the treatment period should return to the study center for the EOS visit and as clinically indicated. Patients who have skin lesions that are being followed and withdraw from the study prior to Week 12 will be asked to have a skin biopsy at the EOS Visit. If applicable, 
patients who withdraw from the study prior to Week 16 will be asked to have a 
18F-FDG -
PET/CT at the EOS Visit.

Version 3.0  Patients who decide not to receive any fur ther study drug will be offered all follow -up 
safety assessments, including the EOS visit after their last infusion.  
If a patient fails to attend scheduled study assessments, the Investigator must determine 
and document the reasons and the circumstances as completely and accurately as possible. 
6.4.2. Study Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients will be informed that they have the right to discontinue from the study and 
withdraw consent at any time for any reason, without prejudice to their medical care. The Investigator also has the right to withdraw patients from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• Patient non-adherence to study drug or protocol requirements. 
• Patient unwillingness to continue in the study. 
• Any other reason, based upon the medical judgment of the Investigator. 
The reason for study withdrawal is to be documented in the patient’s source documents 
and eCRF.  
At the time of discontinuation from the study, patients are to have all the assessments planned for the final follow-up visit performed after the l ast study drug dose, if feasible.  
6.4.3. Replacement of Patients  
If a patient is withdrawn from the study for any reason, whether related to the study drug or not, or if a patient voluntarily withdraws before or after receiving the study drug, such patient will be considered an early -termination patient.  
Investigator will make every effort to ensure that early -termination patients who have 
received study drug complete the safety follow up assessments.  
Patients who withdraw for reasons other than treatment- related AEs may be replaced at 
the discretion of the Sponsor. The decision regarding the replacement of patients will be documented. 
6.5. Study Completion  
A patient is considered to have completed the study if they received at least 5 of 6 scheduled study drug doses and completed all follow -up visits.

Version 3.0  6.6. Study Termination  
If the Sponsor or Investigator discovers conditions arising during the study that suggest 
the study should be halted, then this can happen only after appropriate consultation between the Sponsor and Inv estigator. Conditions that may warrant study termination 
include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of any unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the patients 
enrolled in the study. 
• Insufficient adherence to the protocol requirements.  
• A decis ion on the part of the Sponsor to discontinue the Study 
• A decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of ATYR1923. 
6.7. Investigator Compliance  
If the study center deviates significantly from the protocol without prior approval from the Sponsor and regulatory authorities, the center may be discontinued from the study. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of all research records, the accountability of Study Drug, and the conduct of clinical and laboratory evaluations as outlined in the protocol. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the clinical study is performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) guidance 
documents. 
6.8. Data Safety Monitoring Board  
Ongoing review of blinded safety and tolerability data will be performed by the Medical Monitor and aTyr Pharma personnel. 
In addition, an independent DSMB will perform interim reviews of unblinded sa fety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity data from each cohort and hoc per Sponsor request if a 
pattern of unexpected, clinically significant trends or changes in other safety assessments is identified through blinded safety data reviews. 
The DSMB will provide its recommendation to aTyr Pharma. Such recommendation may

Version 3.0  7. STUDY DRUG  
7.1. Study Drug Dose and Administration  
7.1.1. Treatments Administered  
The planned study cohorts are identified in Table 2 . In all study cohorts, it is planned that 
study drug will be administered as an IV infusion over approximately 60 minutes every 
4 weeks for a total of 6  doses (20 weeks of treatment). Within each cohort, patients will 
be assigned to A TYR1923 or placebo according to the computer- generated 
randomization list (see Section  7.1.3).  
Although this is an escalating dose study, if safety or tolerability issues are experienced, or the actual ATYR1923 PK appears to be substantially different from what is predicted, a different dose or interval may be administered in the next cohort. Further, an intermediate dose may be tested to gain more information on safety, tolerability and/or PK.  
For the preparati on of the ATYR1923 dose levels, the patient’s weight at Screening will 
be used. 
7.1.2. Identity of Investigational Products 
7.1.2.1. AYTR1923  
The ATYR1923 Drug Product is a sterile, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to 
slightly yellow, preservative -free liquid concentrate for IV administration. ATYR1923 
Drug Product (3.8 mL fill volume) is supplied in a single -use borosilicate glass vial, 
stoppered with bromobutyl rubber stopper (with FluroTec coating), and sealed with aluminum Flip -off
® seal. The formulation of ATYR1923 Drug Product contains 
25 mg/mL ATYR1923, 20 mM L-histidine, 125 mM sodium chloride, 3% sucrose, 10 mM L -methionine, and 0.02% polysorbate 20 at pH 6.9.  
ATYR1923 will be administered to patients by IV infusion after appropriate dilution in 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) as outlined in the study Pharmacy Manual.  
7.1.2.2. Placebo  
Placebo will be supplied as the formulation buffer in vials that are similar in appearance to ATYR1923.

Version 3.0  Placebo will be administered to patien ts by IV infusion after appropriate dilution in 0.9% 
sterile sodium chloride solution, USP, as outlined in the study Pharmacy Manual. 
7.1.3. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Cohorts 
After obtaining informed consent, patients will be screened according to the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria and will be assigned to a cohort based on their availability. Within each cohort, 12 patients will be randomized 2:1 (block size of 6) in a blinded fashion to ATYR1923 (N=8) or placebo (N=4).  
7.1.3.1. Dose Escalation Procedure 
Cohorts 1 through 3 will be enrolled sequentially in a staggered manner. After at least 
6 patients of a given cohort have received at least 3 infusions of study drug (ATYR1923 or placebo), cumulative unblinded safety data (including but not limited to any reported AEs, ECG recordings, clinical laboratory tests, and vital signs) will be reviewed by the DSMB. Enrollment in the next scheduled cohort may commence after this review is completed, dose escalation is approved, and the remaining 6 patients have been randomized in the previous cohort. Dose escalation will continue in this manner until the highest planned dose level of ATYR1923 is reached, or the criteria for pausing enrollment have been met (see Section 7.1.3.2).  
7.1.3.2. Criteria for Pausing Enrollment  
In the event that a serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction (SUSAR) has occurred, the enrollment and initiation of study drug administration to new patients will be paused and the Sponsor will request an unblinded review by the DSMB, who will provide its recommendation to aTyr Pharma. Such recommendation may include, but is not limited to, stopping an ongoing cohort, stopping further dose escalation, continuing the study as planned, or continuing the study with modifications, such as evaluation of a lower or intermediate dose in the next cohort(s) to gain more information on safety and tolerability.  
In addition, if unexpected, clinically significant trends or changes in other safety assessments are identified du ring routine blinded safety reviews the Sponsor may request 
the DSMB to similarly perform an unblinded review and provide recommendations.  
7.1.4. Selection of Doses in the Study  
7.1.4.1. First -in-Human Study ATYR1923-C-001  
The first in human study ATYR1923-C-001 evaluated single ascending dose 
administration of ATYR1923 at doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3.0 and 5.0 mg/kg.  
The ATYR1923 sta rting dose  of 0.03 mg/kg was b ased on: 1) the no-observed adverse 
effect level ( NOAE L) from non-cl inical Good Laboratory Practice to xicity studie s;

Version 3.0  2) est imation of the human minimum pha rmacologically active dose (PAD) level range 
(0.035 to 0.1 mg/kg ) based on total body weight; and 3) estimation of human P AD based 
on pre dicted ATYR1923 human se rum PK p aramete rs, determin ed from sin gle species 
(NHP ) allomet ric scaling to humans. These approaches support ed a human sta rting  dose 
level for A TYR1923 of 0.03 mg/kg, whic h was just below the lowe r end of the human 
PAD calcul ation ran ge (0.035–1.0 mg/kg ) and we ll belo w the  maximum recommended 
starting dose (0.97 mg/kg ). The highest sin gle dose (5.0 mg/kg ) plann ed in the first-in-
human Phase 1 study was ant icipated to produce mean se rum exposure lev els that 
remained at least 2-fold below those s een in anima l toxicity testing at the NOAEL. 
7.1.4.2. Current Study in Patients with Pulmonary Sarcoidosis 
The proposed doses in the current study in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis are 
1.0 mg/kg (Cohort 1), 3.0 mg/kg (Cohort 2), and 5.0 mg/kg (Cohort 3). Cohorts will be enrolled sequentially in a staggered manner. 
Selection of the proposed doses is primarily informed by clinical and pharmacological 
findings from ATYR1923-C-001, in which single doses of ATYR1923 were well tolerated across the broad dose range from 0.03 up to 5.0 mg/kg, with no clear dose-relationship with regard to the incidence of TEAEs, or changes in clinical laboratory parameters or other safety measures. No SAEs or severe AEs were reported at any dose, indicating that the starting dose of 1.0 mg/kg dose in this study should be acceptable.  
Repeat administration of ATYR1923 once monthly is expected to result in little or no 
accumulation of peak (ie, maximum concentration [C
max]) and total (ie, area under the 
curve [AUC]) serum exposure measures at steady -state when compared to single dosing. 
For ex ample, C max and area under the curve from time zero to 168 hours (AUC [0-168h]) 
after the 6th monthly dose of ATYR1923 at 5 mg/kg is predicted to be 109,618 ng/mL 
and 3,577,275 ng ⋅h/mL, respectively; estimates that are highly similar to the values 
observed after a single dose of ATYR1923 at 5 mg/kg in ATYR1923-C-001 (109,250 ng/mL and 3,417,001 ng ⋅h/mL, respectively).  
In a Good Laboratory Practice- comp
 liant 6 -month duration toxicology study in NHPs, 
the NOAEL was 60 mg/kg by IV injection once weekly, the highest dose administered. The mean serum exposures (AUC
[0-168h]) measured at the NOAEL in this study ranged 
from 27,900,000 ng ⋅h/mL (Day 1) to 44,400,000 ng ⋅h/mL (Day 176). Comparison of the 
mean serum exposures observed in NHPs with those predicted in subjects after the 6th 
monthly dose of ATYR1923 at the 5 mg/kg dose (3,577,275 ng ⋅h/mL) estimates a safety 
margin of 8 -12-fold. Safety margins based on comparison of mean maximal 
concentrations (mean C 0 ranged from 1,880,000-2,080,000 ng/mL in NHPs versus the 
mean predicted C max of 109,618 ng/mL in humans) are higher at 17-19- fold. Therefore, 
repeat -dose administration of ATYR1923 to patients over a 6-month duration at doses up 
to 5 mg/kg is expected to produce mean serum exposures that remain well below those seen in animal toxicity testing for up to 6 months.

Version 3.0  7.1.5. Blinding  
The following controls will be employed to maintain the double-blind status of the study: 
• The infusion solution containing active drug and placebo will be indistinguishable 
in appearance.  
• The study center pharmacist or designated unblinded study team member will 
have access to random treatment assignments via IWRS for dispensing purposes; treatment assignments will be accessible only to the pharmacist or designated 
unblinded study tea m member and will be maintained in a blinded fashion. 
• PK results for the interim analyses will be presented in a blinded fashion. 
To manage the patient’s condition in case of a medical emergency, the Investigator (or delegate) is allowed to break the code in order to identify whether a patient received 
ATYR1923 or placebo. If the blind is broken for an individual patient, the name of the person who broke the blind and the date and time of and the reason for breaking the blind must be documented. The Sponsor will be informed in case of unblinding. There are no 
specific antidotes for ATYR1923. Knowledge of whether the patient received ATYR1923 or placebo, may not necessarily help in the care of an individual patient. The need to break the blind must therefore be carefully considered. 
The laboratory where the PK samples are to be analyzed will also be provided access to 
the randomization code within the IWRS to distinguish between samples of patients dosed with ATYR1923 versus placebo. 
7.1.6. Concomitant Medication and Other Restrictions During the Study  
7.1.6.1. Prohibited or Restricted Concomitant Medications and Substances  
The following treatments and procedures are prohibited prior to and/or during study 
participation, as indicated below: 
• Immunomodulatory agents, such as TNF-α inhibitors (eg, infliximab, adalimumab), 
are prohibited from 4 months of Day 1 and through the duration of study drug 
treatment.  
• Live vaccination within 8 weeks before Day 1 and during study participation is 
prohibited. 
• All investigational agents or dev ices (other than ATYR1923) within 3 months for 
small molecules and 6 months for biologics, or 5 half-lives (if known) of the agent, whichever is longer, before the first study drug dose and through the duration of study drug treatment.  
• Major surgeries are prohibited from 3 months before the first study drug dose through 
the duration of study drug treatment.

Version 3.0  • Heavy smoking/inhalation of tobacco/nicotine -containing products >20 cigarettes/day 
or e-cigarette equivalent.  
• Topical treatment of any lesion identifie d by the Investigator for cutaneous assessments 
(eg, biopsy). 
All other concomitant medications and procedures are allowed.  
Concomitant medications are to be recorded in the source documents and in the eCRF. 
7.1.6.2. Oral Corticosteroid Taper 
Starting on Day 15, patients will begin a taper (reduction) in OCS (per the ATYR1923-C-
002 Oral Corticosteroid Taper Guidelines) from their starting dose of 10- 25 mg/day of 
prednisone (or equivalent) to a target dose of 5 mg/day, to be completed on or before Day 50. The OCS dose will be tapered by 5.0 mg/day every 1 to 2 weeks, depending on 
the starting dose. Smaller incre mental titrations to the target dose of 5 mg /day by Day 50 
may be implemented per Investigator judgement. Patients will be maintained at the target dose of 5.0 mg/day (or equivalent) through Week 24/EOS. Optionally, further titrations in the OCS dose to below 5 mg/day may be attempted  after the Week 16 visit , if 
determined by the Investigator to be feasible.  
Patient will document OCS doses in a diary, which wi ll be reviewed at relevant 
scheduled telephone contacts and study visits. 
7.1.6.3. Rescue Treatment with Oral Corticosteroids  
Patients who develop an acute worsening of symptoms or are unable to adhere to the 
protocol- defined OCS tapering regimen may receive ‘rescu e’ treatment with higher OCS 
doses as clinically indicated.  
The following criteria should be met prior to providing rescue OCS treatment: 
1a) Worsening cough, documented by a decrease of ≥1 point on the LCQ, 
OR 
1b) Worsening dyspnea, documented by an increase of ≥1 point on the TDI, 
AND 
2) The Investigator’s clinical judgement that rescue therapy is warranted.  
Rescue therapy is not mandated in the event of worsening cough or worsening dyspnea if 
the Investigator determines that an increase in steroid dose is not clinically indicated.  
Upon resolution of symptoms, the Investigator may choose to reinstitute a taper back down to the target maintenance dose of 5 mg/day.  
Patients who require rescue treatment following 2 attempts at tapering to 5  mg/day may 
remain on a higher stable dose of OCS as determined by the Investigator.

Version 3.0  Patients who require an increase in OCS dose at any time in the study should continue to 
receive blinded study drug and followed through to the end of the study.  
Patient will document OCS doses in a diary, which will be reviewed at relevant 
scheduled telephone contacts and study visits. 
7.1.6.4. Contraception  
For this study, male patie nts will be considered to be of non- childbearing potential if they 
have azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying 
medical condition).  
Female patients will be considered of non- childbearing potential if they are either 
surgically sterilized (eg, hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion) or at least 1  year postmenopausal 
(confirmed by amenorrhea duration of at least 12 months and serum FSH ≥30 mIU/mL ). 
Female patients of childbearing potential must be non -pregnant and non- lactating, and 
have a negative pregnancy test at Screening (serum) and at Day 1 (urine) prior to first 
study drug infusion. A urine pregnancy tests must be repeated at Weeks 8 and 16 and a serum  pregnancy test must be repeated at Week 24.  
Female and male patients of childbearing potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug by complying with one of the following:   
• Practice abstinence
1 from heterosexual activity. (If a patient who was initially 
abstinent decides to be sexually active during study participation, the patient must 
agree to use highly- effective contraception, as ou tlined below.) 
OR  
• Use (or have their partner use) highly- effective contraception during heterosexual 
activity. Examples of h ighly-effective methods of contraception include: 
Single method (one of the following is acceptable):  
- Intrauterine device.  
- Vasectomy of a female patient’s exclusive male partner.  
                                                      
1 Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is 
consistently employed as the patient’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by local regulatory agencies and IRB/IEC. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, sympto -
thermal, post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

Version 3.0  - Contraceptive rod implanted into the skin. 
Combination method (requires use of two of the following): 
- Diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide).  
- Cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only). 
- Contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only). 
- Male condom or female condom (cannot be used together). 
- Hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pill (estrogen/progestin pill or progestin-only pill), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous contraceptive injection. 
Refer t o the Clinical Trials Facilitation Group guidelines (available 
at:  https://www.hma.eu/fileadmin/dateien/Human_Medicines/01 -
About_HMA/Working_Groups/CTFG/2014_09_HMA_CTFG_Contraception.pdf ) for 
additional details regarding highly effective birth control methods (i.e., methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly).  
If a highly effective contraceptive method is restricted by local regulations/guidelines, 
then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for patient s 
participating at sites in that location.  
7.1.7. Treatment Compliance  
Study drug will be administered at the study center. To ensure treatment compliance, 
administration of the study drug will be supervised by the Investigator or authorized designee. Compliance will be further confirmed by bioanalytical assessment of ATYR1923 in serum samples (see Section  8.2.5).  
The exact times of study drug  infusion start and completion and number of milligrams 
and total volume admi nistered will be recorded in the eCRF.

8.1. Schedule of Assessments  
The Schedule of Assessments is presented in Table 1. 
8.2. Screening and Baseline Measurements  
8.2.1. Informed Consent  
All patients must provide written informed consent, based on local age of majority, 
before any samples are collected or evaluations performed in this study that are not part of standard patient care.  
8.2.2. Demographics 
Patient demographics, including age, sex, and race, are to be documented during Screening.  
8.2.3. Medical History  
A complete medical history, including history of pulmonary sarcoidosis and prior treatments thereof, is to be documented during Screening.  
8.2.4. Serology 
A blood sample for serology, including HIV1 and 2, HBsAg, and anti-HCV, is to be 
collected during Screening. Patients with positive results are not eligible for study participation.  
Rheumatoid Factor (RF) will also be tested at Day 1 . ATYR1923 is an FC-fusion protein 
and as such, the presence and binding of RF to the FC region of ATYR1923 could 
confound the detection of ADA. Rheumatoid factor positivity status will be used to facilitate the interpretation of ADA assay results and in the modification of the ADA assay to detect only antibodies directed against th e therapeutic part of the molecule.  
RF positivity will not exclude the patient from the study.  
8.2.4.1. Modified MRC Dyspnea Scale 
The Modified MRC Dyspnea Scale is a five- level rating scale based on the patient’s 
perception of dyspnea in daily activities, ranging from none (Grade 0) to very severe dyspnea (Grade 4). The score is the number that best fits the patient’s level of activity. All the questions relate to everyday activities and are generally easily understood by patients. A score can usually be obtained in a few seconds.  
The Modified MRC Dyspnea Scale is to be administered during Screening .

Version 3.0  8.2.5. Quality of Life Measures  
All quality of life assessments are to be performed before other study procedures at each 
designated visit and are to be completed in the sam e order at each designated visit.  
8.2.5.1. Sarcoidosis Assessment Tool  
The SAT is a sarcoidosis -specific patient -reported outcome developed for use in 
sarcoidosis clinical studies to measure the patient’s assessment of impact of disease and response to therapy. The SAT requires approximately 5 –10 minutes for completion 
(Judson et al, 2015).  
The SAT Tool is to be administered at the time points designated in Table 1 . 
8.2.5.2. The Self -Administered Computerized Baseline and Transitional Dyspnea 
Indices (SAC BDI -TDI)  
The BDI measures the severity of dyspnea at the baseline (or the beginning of a clinical study), and the TDI measures changes from this baseline (transition period) at subsequent visits. The BDI and TDI each contain 24 items, with items on the BDI rated in 5 grades from 0 (very severe) to 4 (no impairment), and items on the TDI rated by 13 grades ranging from -6 (major deterioration) to +6 (major improvement). The lower the score on 
the BDI, th e worse the severity of dyspnea at baseline and the lower the score on the TDI, 
the more deterioration in the severity of dyspnea. The minimal clinically important difference of the TDI is a total score of 1 ( Witek and Mahler, 2003). The SAC BDI -TDI 
takes approximately 5 -10 minutes to complete.  
The SAC BDI -TDI indices are to be administered at the time points designated in 
Table 1. 
8.2.5.3. King’s Sarcoidosis Questionnaire  
The KSQ is an online 29-item questionnaire to be completed by sarcoidosis patients 
(Patel et al. 2012 ). The KSQ is split into 5 sections; general health status, lungs, 
medication, skin, and eyes. Results are given as a number between 1-100 with higher numbers indicating better health. The questionnaire takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.  
The KSQ is to be administered at the time points designated in Table 1. 
8.2.5.4. Leicester Cough Questionnaire 
The LCQ is a 19 -item self -completed quality of life measure of chronic cough which is 
responsive to change ( Birring et al, 2003). Items on the scale are divided into 3 domains, 
physical, psychological, and social. Items are scored on a 7-point Likert scale. A total score (range 3 to 21) is also calculated by adding the domain scores together, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The questionnaire takes 5 to 10 minutes to

Version 3.0  complete ( Ward, 2016). The minimal clinically important difference  (MCID) for chronic 
cough is 1.3 ( Raj et al, 2009 ). 
The LCQ is to be administered at the time points designated in Table 1. 
8.2.5.5. Fatigue Assessment Scale 
The FAS contains 10 specific fatigue questions that have been validated in sarcoidosis 
patients ( De Vries et al, 2004 ). On each question, one of 5 answer categories can be 
chosen, from never to always: 1=never; 2=sometimes (about monthly or less); 3=regularly (a bout a few times a month); 4=often (about weekly); 5=always (about every 
day). An answer to each question has to be given, even if the person does not have any complaints at the moment. Scores on questions 4 and 10 should be recoded (1=5, 2=4, 3=3, 4=2, 5=1). Subsequently, the total FAS score can be calculated by summing the scores on all questions (the recoded scores for question 4 and 10). The sum of questions 3 and 6–9 indicates mental fatigue, and the sum of the questions 1, 2, 4, 5 and 10 indicates physical fatigue. The minimal score is 10, and the maximal score is 50. Scores of ≥22 are considered to represent substantial fatigue. A change in the FAS score of 4 points is considered to be the MCID ( de Kleijn et al, 2011). The FAS takes 
approximately 5 -10 minutes to complete.  
The Fatigue Assessment Scale is to be administered at the time points designated in Table 1.  
8.3. Pharmacokinetic Measurements and Variables  
At the time points defined in the  Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1), blood samples will 
be taken for the PK analysis of ATYR1923 in serum samples. T he blood samples will be 
taken via an indwelling IV catheter or by direct venipuncture into plain serum tubes. The exact times of blood sampling will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Details on sample collection, handling, storage and shipping of blood samples for PK 
analysis of ATYR1923 will be described in the Laboratory Manual. 
8.4. Pharmacodynamic/Exploratory Measurements and Variables 
8.4.1. Blood for Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and Serum Biomarkers  
Blood samples for the analysis of PBMCs and biomarkers  in serum will be taken at the 
time points designated in Table 1. The blood samples will be taken via an indwelling IV 
catheter in tubes containing anticoagulants or by direct venipuncture into plain serum tubes. The exact times of blood sampling will be recorded in the eCRF.  
The state of immune cell anergy in PBMCs will be measured by flow cytometry and 
cytokine secretion, at baseline and after activation with T- cell receptor -dependent 
and -independent stimuli. Immunophenotyping may also be performed.

Version 3.0  Serum biomarkers to be measured will include, but will not be limited  to, ACE, sIL-2R, 
extracellular HARS, NRP2, and VEGFC.  
Details on sample collection, handling, storage and shipping of blood samples for 
analysis will be described in the study Laboratory Manual prepared by Sponsor and study 
center.  
8.4.2. Pulmonary Function Test s 
Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including FVC, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV
1), and FEV 1/FVC ratio, are to be determined by spirometry at the time points 
designated in Table 1.  
Spirometry testing will be performed according to the American Thoracic 
Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines  (Miller et al, 20 05). The spirometry 
equipment will be supplied to each site for the study. The same spirometry equipment should be used for all assessments performed for a patient. A limited number of staff, as designated by the investigator, will evaluate all patients at all visits throughout the entire trial. Where possible the same technician should perform all maneuvers f or an individual 
patient. All staff conducting the spirometry tests must have received appropriate training which must be documented. Information on the procedure can be found in the Instructions for Use M anual.  
Spirometry ideally is to be performed with the patient in a seated position for at least 2 minutes and wearing nose- clips; the patient is to remain seated throughout the test 
procedure. It is recommended that the test be performed at least 1 hour after a light meal, with the patient having refrained from recent exercise. Spirometry is to be performed in the same manner across all assessment time points.  
If the patient cannot tolerate nose-clips and/or cannot perform the maneuver in a seated position, then spirometry may be performed without nose- clips and/or in a standing 
position; however, all subsequent assessments are to be performed in the same manner. 
8.4.3. Diffusion Capacity  
DL
CO is to be measured using the single -breath technique at the time points designated in 
Table 1. DL CO measurements should be obtained after patients have been sitting quietly 
for 5 minutes. DL
CO is to be corrected for hemoglobin. 
8.4.4. Cutaneous Disease Assessment (for Patients with Cutaneous Disease)  
For patients with cutaneous disease at baseline, cutaneous disease will be assessed by the 
Investigator using the SPGA, BSA assessment, and SASI.

Version 3.0  The patient’s overall skin health will be assessed  by the Investigator during Screening 
and at the time points designated in Table 1 using the SPGA, a visual analog scale 
ranging from 0 (perfect health) to 10 (worst skin condition imaginable).  
The handprint method, with 1 handprint equaling ~1% BSA, will be used to determine 
the percentage of  the body surf ace is  affected by cutaneous disease.  
The SASI is an instrument that will be used to evaluate a lesion prospectively identified as the ‘target’ lesion, located anywhere on the body. The Investigator will score the extent of erythema and induration of this lesion, each on a scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) ( Baughman et al, 2012; Drake et al, 2013; Judson et al, 2014).   
Topical treatment of target lesion selected for the SASI assessment should be avoided. 
8.4.5. Cutaneous Lesion Biopsy (Optional at Selected Sites for Patients with 
Cutaneous Disease)  
For patients with cutaneous disease, a non-target lesion (ie, a lesion that is not being 
assessed by  the SASI over time)  is to be selected during Screening by the Investigator 
and confirmed by the patient that it had been identified by his or her private dermatologist as cutaneous sarcoidosis. The lesion is to be biopsied (skin punch) during Screening and again at Week 12  (±5 days), or at early termination if occurring prior to 
Week 12. Skin punch biopsy is to be performed according to standard institutional practice with regard to antiseptic preparation technique and local anesthesia.  
8.4.6. Whole Body 
18F-FDG -PET/CT  
In this study, patients who elect to do so will undergo whole-body head to mid-thigh 18F-
FDG imaging on a PET/CT scanner with a reconstructed resolution of ≤5 mm. Whole body 
18F-FDG is to be performed within 4 weeks prior to Day 1, within ±5 days of Week 
16, or at early termination if occurring prior to Week 16. Patients with glucose levels above 11 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) should have their scan delayed or be rescheduled as appropriate. The blood glucose level measured prior to the radiotracer administration should be recorded in an image transmittal form. Patients are to fast for a minimum of 4 hours prior to the injection of 
18F-FDG. During the uptake phase, patients are to rest 
quietly and to refrain from talking, walking, and any other muscular activity to prevent non-specific FDG uptake in the skeletal muscles. The radiotracer will be administered 
through an IV line, after which the patient will be positioned comfortably in a supine position to rest for 60 to 90 minutes while the radiotracer distributes through the body. 
Patients will be asked to void their bladder prior to the scanning procedure.  A whole body low-dose attenuation correction CT will be acquired with a whole body 
effective dose of 1.5 mSv. The maximum injected radioactivity dose of 555 MBq of 
18F-FDG will result in a maximum whole body effective dose per PET/CT timepoint of 
≤8.5 mSv, dependent upon patient habitus and calculated injected activity. As a weight -

Version 3.0  based dose approach is allowed and is dependent upon subject weight, it is possible that 
in large or obese patients, a higher 18F-FDG activity may be required to ensure sufficient 
imaging quality ; however in such cases, the injected activity will not exceed 555 MBq . 
The baseline and follow-up 18F-FDG uptake PET scan will be assessed centr ally by a 
qualified nuclear medicine physician visually and quantitatively using standardized uptake values (SUVs) and results will be compared with baseline scan. SUV is taken as an index of disease activity. Total injected activity and body weight will be recorded and used to compute SUV values. PET response will be determined by the nuclear medicine physician according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria.  
The total dose for all PET scanning in this protocol will be maximally 17 mSv in larger or obese patients who have received a higher 
18F-FDG injected dose. 
Detailed information will be provided in a separate 18F-FDG -PET/CT Imaging M anual.  
8.5. Safety and Tolerability Measurements  
Safety and tolerability assessments  will consist of physical examinations, vital signs and 
temperature, 12 -lead ECGs, pulse oximetry, weight, immunogenicity, AEs, and clinical 
laboratory tests.  Concomitant medications also will be documented. Assessments will be 
performed in accordance with  the Schedule of Assessments.  
8.5.1. Physical Examination and Infusion Site Examination 
A complete physical examination is to be performed during Screening and at Week 12 
and Week 24/EOS. The complete physical examination is to include measurement of height durin g Screening.  
Complete physical examinations also will include a review of the following body 
systems:  
• General appearance.  
• Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat. 
• Respiratory.  
• Cardiovascular.  
• Abdomen. 
• Neurologic.  
• Extremities.  
• Dermatologic.  
Abbreviated symptom- directed physical examinations are to be performed at the other 
study visits, as indicated.

CONFIDENTIAL 56 
Version 3.0  The findings of each examination are to be documented in the eCRF. 
The IV infusion site will be examined at 0.5 and 1.5 hours ( +10 minutes) after the end of 
each st udy drug infusion. Any clinically significant findings will be recorded as AEs. 
8.5.2. Vital Signs and Temperature  
Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration rate, are to be measured 
at the time points designated in Table 1.  
At each clinic visit, vital signs are to be measured before blood sample collection that 
day. Heart rate and blood pressure determinations will be measured after the patient has 
been lying supine for at least 5 minute s. 
On stu dy drug administration days, vital signs are to be measured pre-infusion and at 
15 and 30 minutes (±5 minutes) and at 1, 2, and 4 hours (±15 minutes) after the start of infusion (SOI). Vital signs are to be measured before blood sample collection.  
Temperature is to be measured at the time points designated in Table 1. On study drug 
administration days, temperature is to be measured pre-dose, 60 minutes (±15 minutes) 
after the SOI, and again at 4 hours (±15 minutes ) after the SOI. Temperature is to be 
measured at the same time as vital signs.  
8.5.3. Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG is to be performed at the time points designated in Table 1 after the 
patient has been lying supine for at least 5 minutes. On all study drug dosing days, the 
ECG is to be performed within 1 hour pre-dose. At Day 1 and Weeks 12 and 20, an ECG 
also is to be performed at 4 hours (±30 minutes) after the SOI.  
The ECG will be recorded using an ECG machine equipped with computer based interval 
measurements The following ECG parameters will be recorded: heart rate, PR -interval, 
QRS -duration, QT- interval, QTc -interval (Fridericia's) and the interpretation of the ECG 
profile by the Investigator. 
8.5.4. Pulse Oximetry  
Continuous pulse oximetry is to be performed at the time points designated in  Table 1. 
On study drug administration days, continuous pulse oximetry is to be performed from 
5 minutes pre-dose until the end of study drug infusion, and also obtained and recorded at the same time points as vital signs. On non -study drug administration days, pulse 
oximetry is to be obtained with vital sign assessments (see Section 8.5.2).  
8.5.5. Height and Weight 
Heig ht will be measured at Screening only. Weight is to be measured at the time points 
designated in Table 1. 
The patient’s Screening weight is to be used to calculate the study drug dose. If the 
patient has experienced a notable change in weight (±10%), the patient’s study drug dose 
aTyr Pharma, Inc.

Version 3.0  will be recalculated. Any change in study drug dose is to be documented in the source 
documents and in the eCRF. 
8.5.6. Immunogenicity Measurements  
Blood samples for determination of Jo-1 Ab leve ls in serum will be collected at the time 
points designated in Table 1. Those with a level considered equivocal or positive (ie, 
>7 U/mL)  for the assay will not receive study drug. Any patients who develops positi ve 
Jo-1 antibodies will also be monitored clinically for signs/symptoms of anti- synthetase 
syndrome. 
In addition, blood samples for determination of ADAs against ATYR1923 in serum will 
be collected at the time points designated in Table  1. ADA blood samples collected 
during Screening from patients who subsequently are determined to be screen failures  
will be used towards additional modification and validation of the ADA assay.  
Blood samples will be processed as de scribed in the Laboratory M anual and evaluated for 
the presence of ADAs. The exact times of blood sampling will be recorded in the eCRF.  
8.5.7. Adverse Events  
AEs will be recorded from the time of written informed consent through the last visit for 
a patient. Any  clinically significant observations in results of clinical laboratory, 12 -lead 
ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, or physical examinations are to be recorded as part of the patient’s medical history if occurring prior to start of dosing and as an AE if oc curring 
after the start of study drug administration at Day 1, where the finding represents a change from Baseline.  
A TEAE is defined as any event not present prior to (the first) administration of the study 
drug or any event already present that worsens i n either intensity or frequency following 
exposure to the study drug.  
An AE which occurs prior to (the first) administration of the study drug will be 
considered a pre- treatment AE.  
AEs that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug injection shoul d be captured as 
individual signs and symptoms (eg, dyspnea, rash, flushing) rather than a diagnosis of allergic reaction or IRR.  
At study visits, patients will be asked non -leading questions to determine the occurrence 
of AEs. Patients will be asked in general terms about any AEs at regular intervals during the study. In addition, all AEs reported spontaneously during the course of the study will be recorded.  
The intensity of each AE will be rated by the Investigator using the National Cancer Institute Co mmon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 5.0 
(available

Version 3.0  at:  https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v
5_Quick_Reference_8.5x11.pdf ).  
AEs not listed on the NCI CTCAE are to be rated by the Investigator as “mild (Grade 1)”, 
“moderate (Grade 2)”, “severe” (Grade 3), “life -threatening”(Grade 4), or “fatal” 
(Grade  5).  
The relationship between the AEs and the study drug will be indicated as “ not related”, 
“unlikely related”, “possibly related”, or “related ”. AEs assessed as “possibly  related ” or 
“related” will be considered to be related to the study drug whereas AEs assessed as “not related” or “unlikely  related ” will be considered not to be related to the study drug.  
Details on the rating of the severity of the AEs and relationship to the study treatment are given in Section  9.2. 
8.5.8. Concomitant Medications  
All medications and supplements the patient receives during the course of the study are to be documented in the source documents and in the eCRF. 
8.5.9. Safety Laboratory Tests 
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory assessm ents will be collected according 
to the Laboratory Manual and study center standard operating procedures ( SOPs ). 
The following parameters will be measured:  
• Clinical chemistry (serum quantitatively):  
- Total bilirubin,  alkaline  phosphatase, gamma glutamyl tra nsferase 
(gamma -GT), a spartate aminotransferase (AST), a lanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), l actate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase, albumin,

Version 3.0  - Microscopy is to be performed if indicated by an abnormal and clinically 
significant result 
• Serum Complement, Tryptase/Plasma Complement and immunoglobulin E (IgE): 
- Blood samples for serum complement, tryptase/plasma complement and IgE 
are to be collected at Day 1. Such test are to be repeated if a patient experiences an IRR (see Section 9.9). 
In case of unexplained or unexpected clinical laboratory test val ues, the tests will be 
repeated as soon as possible and followed up until the results have returned to the normal range, baseline level and/or an adequate explanation for the abnormality is found. The clinical laboratory will clearly mark all laboratory test values that are outside the normal range and the Investigator will indicate which of these deviations are clinically significant. These clinically significant deviating laboratory results will then be recorded as AEs and the relationship to the treatment will be indicated (see also Section 9.2).  
The procedures for the collection, handling, and shipping of laboratory samples are specified in the Laboratory Manual provided to the study site. 
8.5.10. Pregnancy Testing and Follicle Stimulating Hormone  
FSH will be measured in all female patients during Screening. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a serum pregnancy test performed during Screening and a urine pregnancy test performed at Day 1 prior to first study drug infusion. Any patient with a positive  pregnancy test  result is not eligible for study participation.  
Additional pregnancy testing is to be performed during the study at the time points indicated in Ta ble 1. Pregnancy test results are to be obtained and confirmed to be 
negative prior to randomization and study drug infusions. 
All serum samples will be analyzed by the central laboratory, and urine samples will be 
analyzed locally. Any patient determined  to be pregnant during study participation must 
have study drug permanently discontinued immediately (see Section 6.4.1 and Section 
9.8). 
8.5.10.1. Total of Blood Volume 
The total volume of blood to be collected over the duration of the study is approximately 
450 mL (ranging from 30 mL to 75 mL per visit). 
8.5.11. Appropriateness of Measurements  
The assessments, which will be made in this study are standard, and generally recognized 
as reliable, accurate and relevant. Assessments will be performed according to the study 
site.

Version 3.0  9. ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1. Definitions 
9.1.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is defined in the ICH Guideline for GCP as “any untoward medical occurrence in 
a patient or clinical investigation  subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment” (ICH E6:1.2). 
Worsening of a pre-existing medical condition, (ie, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) is 
to be considered an AE if there is either an increase in severity, frequency, or duration of the condition or an association with significantly worse outcomes. 
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (ie, elective cosmetic surgery) or medical 
procedures that were planned before study enrollment are not considered AEs. 
In the case of death, only record “Fatal” for the event causing death. AEs that are ongoing 
at the end of the study or time of death are to be noted as “continuing.”  
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual patient represents a significant change from baseline. In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the Investigator’s judgment) should not be recorded as AEs; however, laboratory value changes requiring therapy or adjustment in prior therapy are considered AEs. 
9.1.2. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational New Drug Application (IND) safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” and/or at least possibly related means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A ‘suspected adverse reaction’ implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than ‘adverse reaction’, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
9.1.3. Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor , it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• is fatal  
• is life -threatening (ie, places the patient at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in -patient hospitalization (overnight stay) or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization  
• results in persistent or signi ficant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Clinical Study Protocol Number ATYR1923-C-002 
25 September 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL 61 
Version 3.0  • is an important medical event; an important medical event is an event that may 
not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring inte nsive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
A hospitalization meeting the regulatory definition for “serious” is any inpatient hospital admission that includes a minimum of an overnight (≥24 hours) stay in a health care facility. Any AE that does not meet one of the definitions of serious (ie, emergency room visit, out-patient surgery, or requires urgent investigation) may be considered by the Investigator to meet the “important medical ev ent” criterion for classification as an SAE.  
9.1.4. Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or intensity that has been previously observed; or, if an Investigator’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the General Investigational Plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  
9.1.5. Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adv erse Reaction  
A SUSAR is any event that meets all 3  of the following definitions: 
1) suspected adverse reaction ( Section  9.1.2);  
2) serious ( Section 9.1.3); and  
3) unexpected ( Section 9.1.4).  
9.2. Adverse Event Assessment  
All AEs will be collected and recorded in this study from the time of written informed consent through the last visit for a patient. This includes AEs the patient reports spontaneously, those observed by the Investigator, and those elicited by the Investigator in response to open-ended questions during scheduled study visits. 
AEs that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug infusion are to be capture d as 
individual signs and symptoms rather than a diagnosis of allergic reaction or IRR.

Version 3.0  Each AE is to be assessed by the Investigator with regard to the following categories. 
Serious/Non -Serious  
AEs that meet the criteria specified in Section  9.1.3 are to be considered serious. 
Relationship to Study Drug  
This determination is based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment regarding the 
likelihood that the study drug caused the AE and may include consideration of some or all of the following factors:  
• Alternative possible causes of the AE, including the patient’s underlying disease or co -morbid conditions, other drugs, other host and environmental factors; 
• The chronological relationship between the exposure to study drug and the AE;  
• Whether the clinical or laboratory manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity of the study drug;  
• Whether the AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stopping the study drug (i.e., dechallenge);  
Whether the AE recurred or worsened with re-exposure to the drug (i.e., rechallenge).  
The relationship between the study drug and the AE will be described using one of the following categories  Table 3 . 
Table 3: Criteria for Determination of Adverse Event Relationship to Study 
Drug  
Relationship  Definition  
Related  The study drug is more likely the cause of the AE than other factors  
Possibly Related  There is a reasonable possibility that th e study drug is the cause of the 
AE, including that the study drug and another factor(s) are equally 
likely as causes of the AE  
Unlikely Related  Another factor is considered more likely  the cause of the AE than the 
study drug  
Not related  Another factor  is considered to be the cause of the AE  
 
Intensity  
The intensity of each AE is to be assessed by the Investigator using the NCI CTCAE, 
version 5.0 (available at:  https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v

9.3. Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring from the time of written informed consent through the last follow -up 
visit, or after the end of the study, if thought to be related to study drug, are to be 
recorded in the source documents and in the eCRF. All AE reports are to contain the following details regarding the AE:  a brief description, onset date and time, resolution date and time, intensity, treatmen t required, relationship to study drug, action taken with 
study drug, outcome, and whether the event is classified as serious. 
AEs that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug injection should be captured as 
individual signs and symptoms (eg, dyspnea, rash, flushing) rather than a diagnosis of allergic reaction or IRR.  
9.4. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs will be collected and recorded throughout the study period, beginning with the signing of the ICF through the last follow-up visit, or after the end of the study if thought to be related to study drug. 
The Investigator must report all SAEs within 24 hours of discovery to the Cont ract 
Research Organization ( CRO ) Safety Team . 
SAE reporting, including supporting materials, will be performed by the s tudy center 
personnel using a system approved by the Sponsor. Detailed training will be provided by 
the CRO . Contact information for guidance and assistance with SAE reporting is 
provided in the Study Reference Manual. A completed SAE report is to be entered into the system approved by the Sponsor within 24 hours of discovering the event. Upon entry

CONFIDENTIAL 65 
Version 3.0  into the system, the responsible parties (including Medical Monitor and Safety Reporting 
Specialist) will be immediately notified.  
The Study Reference Manual will include an emergency back -up paper based reporting 
system, to be used if needed. 
The CRO Safety Team  will immediately (within one business day of receipt) forward the 
SAE report to the Sponsor. The initial report should include at least the following 
information:  
• Patient’s ID number; 
• Description and date of the event; 
• Criterion for serious; and 
• Preliminary assignment of causality to study drug.  
The Medical Monitor may contact the Investigator via telephone for urgent follow-up information regarding the SAE, as appropriate.  
The Investigator, or designated party, should notify the appropriate IRB /IEC  of SAEs 
occurring at the study center and other AE reports received from aTyr, in accordance with local procedures and statutes.  
SAEs that are considered as possibly or definitely related to the investigational product, 
and as unexpected (ie, SUSARs), will be reported to the National Regulatory Authority(ies) and IRB /IEC  by the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee as required by 
applicable local regulations. Per regu lation, any fatal or life -threatening SUSAR will be 
reported to the Nat ional Regulatory Authority(ies) /IRB /IEC  within 7  calendar days, and 
additional information within an additional 8 calendar days. The Sponsor or Sponsor¹s designee is required to submit any other SUSAR to the National Regulatory Authority(ies) /IRB /IEC  within 15 calendar days of notification. The Sponsor or its 
designee is also responsible for notifying the investigational sites of all expedited SAEs, in accordance with local requirements.  The Investigator must keep copies of all expedited 
SAE information including correspondence with the Sponsor on file.  
9.5. Follow -Up of Adverse Events 
The Investigator must continue to follow all study drug- related TEAEs either until 
resolution or the Investigator assesses them as chronic or stable. This follow-up may extend after the end of the study and may be conducted by telephone contact or unscheduled visit. 
9.6. Reporting Safety Information  
The Investigator must promptly report to his or her IRB /IEC  all unan ticipated problems 
involving risks to patients, in accordance with local requirements . This may include death

Version 3.0  from any cause and all SAEs reasonably or possibly associated with the use of study drug 
according to the IRB /IEC ’s procedures.  
9.7. Protocol Deviatio ns Due to an Emergency or Adverse Event  
Departures from the protocol will be determined as allowable on a case- by-case basis and 
only in the event of an emergency (e.g., COVID-19 public health emergency). The Investigator or other physician in attendance i n such an emergency must contact the 
Medical Monitor as soon as possible to discuss the circumstances of the emergency. 
The Medical Monitor, in conjunction with the Investigator, will decide whether the 
patient should continue to participate in the study. All protocol deviations and reasons for such deviations must be noted in the eCRF. Deviations specifically due to COVID -19 are 
to be documented as such. 
9.8. Pregnancy  
Pregnancies occurring while the patient is receiving study drug or within 30 days after the patient’s last dose of ATYR1923 will not be considered serious, but are to be reported using the same procedures as for SAEs described in Section  9.4. 
In the event of a pregnancy, the patient should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
The Investigator will follow the patient until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify the Medical Monitor of the outcome within 5 days. The Investigator will provide this information as a follow -up to the initial report.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), then the Investigator should report it as such. Furthermore, all neonatal deaths that occur within 30 days of birth are to be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported. 
9.9. Management of Potential Infusion Related Reactions, 
Including Anaphylaxis 
ATYR1923 is a biologic and as with all biologics there is a risk for IRRs. These reactions 
typically occur in close temporal relationship with the infusion. They may be related to cytokine release or immune mediated.  
A generalized IRR could be occurring when any symptoms begin during the study drug infusion or during the post-infusion observation period. While these symptoms may be self-limiting, such symptoms may signal the possibility of a severe reaction that could 
escalate into a life-threatening situation.

Clinical Study Protocol Number ATYR1923-C-002 
25 September 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL 67 
Version 3.0  Should a patient develop an IRR the subsequent management will depend on the nature 
of the IRR. Where the IRR symptoms are not cardiorespiratory in nature i.e. they comprise cutaneous rash, flushing, burning sensation etc. and are mild to moderate in intensity – the patient may complete the infusion and receive subsequent doses. The 
patient will need to be observed until all symptoms resolve or for 6 hours after the end of the infusion. Subsequent dosing should continue to occur in a facility where the patient can be monitored closely. The Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, may opt to adjust the infusion duration and/or administer pre- medication (antihistamines, 
non-steroidal anti- inflammatories and anti- emetics) if clinically indicated, although this is 
not mandatory.  
If the IRR symptoms constitute a cardiorespiratory risk (hypotension, dyspnea, hypoxia 
etc.) or any severe AE then all further dosing should be stopped for the patient. If 
necessary, the patient should be transferred to an acute care facility.  
Once the patient is stabilized, additional blood samples are to be collected and procedures performed as outlined below: 
• Vital signs, pulse oximetry, infusion site examination, and ECGs are to be performed to gather clinical information as soon as possible after the ons et of 
clinical symptoms of a generalized IRR (for instance, immediately after cessation of the study drug infusion if such a reaction is seen). Vital signs are to be monitored as medically indicated and pulse oximetry is to be monitored continuously for at least 2  hours or until the patient has recovered, whichever is 
longer. ECGs should be repeated as medically indicated. 
Once medical treatment of the IRR has begun, blood samples are to be obtained for assessment of:  
• Plasma complement factors (C3a, C4a, C5 a, Bb, SC5b- 9). 
• Serum complement (CH50, C3, and C4) and tryptase. 
• ATYR1923 serum concentrations. 
• Jo-1 and ADA.  
Additionally, the following tests and procedures are to be performed 1 to 2 hours after the onset of symptoms:  
• Samples for assessment of:  
- Complete safety laboratory panel, including urine analysis and urine microscopy. 
- IgE. 
- Plasma complement factors (C3a, C4a, C5a, Bb, SC5b- 9). 
- Serum complement (CH50, C3, and C4) and serum tryptase.

The Investigator must inform the study Medical Monitor promptly regarding any patient 
who experiences a generalized IRR for additional instruction. 
Patients who experience generalized IRRs will continue to be monitored / have repeat 
assessments performed at a schedule determined by the Invest igator in consultation with 
the Medical Monitor and Sponsor. Appropriate follow up for the patient must occur to ensure that there are no late- occurring sequelae.  
Note that in the eCRF, AEs that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug injection sh ould be captured as individual signs and symptoms rather than a diagnosis of 
allergic reaction or IRR.  
9.9.1. Anaphylaxis 
IRRs meeting the definition of anaphylaxis are to be reported in the eCRF as such (Sampson et al. 2006):   
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula). 
And a t least one of the following: 
a. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, whee ze-bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced peak expiratory flow, hypoxemia). 
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction 
(eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence). 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Involvement of the skin- mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, 
swollen lips -tongue-uvula). 
b. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced peak expiratory  flow, hypoxemia). 
c. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence). 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting).  
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age specific) or greater than 
30% decrease in systolic blood pressure*.

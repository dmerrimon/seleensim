Study Design: This is a Phase 1/2/3, first-in-human, multi-center, dose-escalation interventional 
study of AAV8-RPGR in male subjects with genetically confirmed XLRP. Part I is a dose-
escalation study; Part II is a dose-expansion study, with 2 doses (2.5 × 10^11 vector genomes (vg) 
[high dose], 5 × 10^10 vg [low dose]) selected from Part I based on a benefit/risk assessment, and a 
third untreated group to allow for a controlled comparison of efficacy and safety. 
Part I consists of 11 visits over a 24-month evaluation period. Part II consists of 10 visits over a 12-
month evaluation period. At the Screening / Baseline Visit, each subject will be assessed for 
eligibility of both eyes. Only 1 eye will be randomized (the “study eye”), and the other eye will be 
designated as the “fellow eye”. Selection of the “study eye” will be made on clinical grounds prior 
to randomization and will generally be the worse eye affected.
At the Injection Day Visit (Visit 2, Day 0), subjects will undergo vitrectomy and iatrogenic retinal 
detachment as part of a sub-retinal injection procedure for administration of AAV8-RPGR in their 
study eye. Subjects in the untreated control group will receive study-visit telephone calls to monitor 
AEs/SAEs and review concomitant medications on Visit 2 (Day 0) and on Visits 3 and 4 
(post-operative Days 1 and 7). 
To minimise inflammation resulting from surgery and/or vector/transgene, in Part I, all subjects 
will be given a 21-day course of oral corticosteroid (e.g., prednisolone/prednisone) that will start 
2 days before the planned date of surgery. 
In Part II, all adult subjects will be given a 9-week course of oral corticosteroid starting 3 days 
before surgery: 21 days at 60 mg, followed by 6 weeks of tapering doses. The dose regimen is 
adjusted for pediatric subjects treated in Part II (see Section 8.8). Subjects may also be treated at 
the time of surgery with up to 1 mL of triamcinolone (40 mg/mL), administered via a deep sub-
Tenon approach. 
Part I: Dose-Escalation Study
Dose escalation part of the study will use a 3+3 escalation scheme (Storer 1989) and will involve 
up to 6 AAV8-RPGR dose cohorts: 5 × 10^9 vg (Cohort 1), 1 × 10^10 vg (Cohort 2), 5 × 10^10 vg 
(Cohort 3), 1 × 10^11 vg (Cohort 4), 2.5 × 10^11 vg (Cohort 5), and 5 × 10^11 vg (Cohort 6). Each 
eligible subject will receive AAV8-RPGR in their study eye and be monitored for DLTs. 
Three to 6 subjects are planned per dose cohort; however, the actual number of subjects enrolled 
into each cohort will depend on the toxicity observed. If no DLTs are observed in the first 
3 subjects treated within a cohort, then escalation to the next dose cohort can proceed. If 1 DLT is 
reported within a 3-subject cohort, an additional 3 subjects will be treated at the same dose. If there 
are no further DLTs reported in the additional 3 subjects, then escalation to the next dose cohort 
can proceed. If ≥2 subjects within a cohort (3 or 6 subjects) have a DLT(s), then the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) will be identified as the previous (lower) dose. If ≥2 subjects with a DLT are 

AAV8-RPGR
Protocol: NSR-RPGR-01Version 11.0

CONFIDENTIAL
7reported within Cohort 1 (3 or 6 subjects), then dosing will cease under this protocol and further 
investigation may occur following a protocol amendment.
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data before confirming 
whether escalation to a higher dose level can occur. There is a potential for surgical complications 
resulting in safety events that meet the criteria for a DLT. In such cases, the DMC will make the 
final adjudication as to whether the event is a DLT. The DMC will review safety data for each 
cohort when at least 3 subjects have been dosed at a particular dose level. However, if 2 subjects 
within a cohort have a DLT(s), dosing will not proceed to subsequent subjects until safety data are 
reviewed by the DMC. For the purpose of making decisions regarding dose escalation, the DMC 
will review safety data collected for at least 4 weeks from each subject in the last dosed cohort. In 
addition, the DMC will review cumulative safety data collected from all previously dosed cohorts 
and take these findings into consideration when making decisions on dose escalation. 
DLTs are defined as any of the following events considered to be related to AAV8-RPGR:
Sustained decrease in BCVA of ≥30 letters on the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy 
Study (ETDRS) chart compared to baseline; sustained is defined as lasting 48 hours or more 
until recovery, with recovery defined as visual acuity (VA) returning to within 10 letters of 
baseline VA. An exception is made for surgery-related events occurring in close temporal 
association (within <24 hours) of the surgery.
Vitreous inflammation, vitritis (>Grade 3 using standardised Nussenblatt vitreous inflammation 
scale grading) (Nussenblatt, Palestine et al. 1985) 
Any clinically significant retinal damage observed (e.g., retinal atrophy) that is not directly 
attributed to complications of surgery 
Any clinically relevant suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (as defined in the 
Investigator’s Brochure), with the exception of vision loss or vision-threatening events (as 
defined in Section 11.2.1)
Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if subjects are unable to attend the 
24-month visit during the protocol-defined window, they should return to the site to complete this 
visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so; this will be considered their 24-month visit. Delays 
will be identified as protocol deviations (PDs) on a case-by-case basis by the Sponsor based on 
information provided by the site; this will include but is not limited to scenarios such as site 
closure, travel bans, medical travel prohibitions, patient illness, etc.
At study completion, Part I subjects will be invited to participate in a separate long-term follow-up 
study that will collect efficacy and safety data up to 5 years from surgery.
Part II: Dose Expansion 
In Part II, approximately 30 subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to a high-dose (2.5 × 10^11 vg), a 
low-dose (5 × 10^10 vg), or a third untreated group to allow for a controlled comparison of efficacy 
and safety. Study data will be collected for both eyes of each subject. Since treatment requires an 
invasive surgical procedure under general anesthesia, the sponsor, investigator and the subject will 
be unmasked to the study procedure (i.e., vitrectomy and sub-retinal injection), however within the 
treated groups, the sponsor, investigator and subject will be masked to the assigned dose level. To 
further minimise potential bias of the treated and non-treated eye evaluations, all subjective 
ophthalmic assessments at the Screening/Baseline Visit (Visit 1) and from Month 3 (Visit 6) 
onwards will be conducted by an assessor who is masked to treated eye and treated vs. untreated 
control group.
All Part II subjects will be followed for 12 months with the pre-specified visit schedule.
During Part II, a single administrative interim analysis (IA) may be conducted. If an IA is 
performed, the study will continue as planned in a masked fashion. 
Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if subjects are unable to attend the 
12-month visit during the protocol-defined window, they should return to the site to complete this 
visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so. This will be considered their 12-month visit. Delays 
will be identified as PDs on a case-by-case basis by the Sponsor based on information provided by

classification system III [LOCS III] cataract grading); fundus photography; vital signs; and 
laboratory assessments (including laboratory safety parameters, viral shedding and 
immunogenicity).
Any safety information collected as a result of the efficacy assessments (e.g., BCVA) will also be 
used in the overall safety evaluation, as appropriate.
Efficacy: The efficacy evaluation will be based on microperimetry (MAIA), BCVA, SD-OCT, 
fundus autofluorescence, visual fields (Octopus 900 specified in Part II only), contrast sensitivity, 
low luminance visual acuity (LLVA), 
Statistical Methodology:
In Part I, the safety analysis set will include all patients enrolled in the study who received 
AAV8-RPGR treatment.
All analyses in Part I will be performed using the Safety Analysis Set.
In Part II, the Safety Analysis Set will consist of all subjects who are randomized, under both the 2- 
and the 3-arm randomization schemes, and receive study treatment when randomized to active 
treatment, or attend Visit 2 (telephone call) when randomized to control (no treatment). The Safety 
Analysis Set will be used for safety analyses and subjects will be analyzed based on the actual 
treatment received. The efficacy summaries of Part II will be generated using the ‘Intent-to-treat 
(ITT) Analysis Set’. The ITT Analysis Set will include all subjects randomised under the 3-arm 
randomisation scheme. Subjects will be analysed based on the treatment which they were 
randomised to. 
In Part II, a single administrative IA may be conducted. A final analysis will be conducted after all 
subjects complete the Month 12 Visit (or are discontinued). 
Summary statistics will be presented for both eyes (Study Eye and Fellow Eye). Continuous 
variables and their change from baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of 
subjects [n], mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, first and third quartiles, fifth 
and ninety-fifth percentiles). Confidence intervals (CI) of the mean and the mean change from 
baseline at each visit maybe be provided, where applicable. For categorical variables, the number 

AAV8-RPGR
Protocol: NSR-RPGR-01Version 11.0

CONFIDENTIAL
10and proportion of subjects pertaining to each category will be presented over time, and the CI 
maybe presented where applicable.
The primary endpoint in Part II, i.e., the proportion of study eyes with ≥7 dB improvement of 
retinal sensitivity from baseline at ≥5 out of the 16 central loci, will be compared between 
treatment groups (high dose vs untreated; low dose vs untreated) using the Fisher Exact-Boschloo 
test with a Berger-Boos correction of beta=0.001 (Berger and Boos 1994). The primary hypothesis 
will be tested using Hochberg’s (Hochberg 1988) step-up method with familywise error rate 
controll
ed at one-sided 0.10. The study will be declared positive if either or both doses achieve 
statistical significance. In addition, the difference in proportions between treatment groups will also 
be presented with its CI calculated by the Miettinen and Nurminen (Miettinen and Nurminen 1985) 
method. 
AEs will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term. Both the number of 
eyes/subjects experiencing an AE and the number of events will be summarized. The serious 
adverse events (SAEs), severity, and relationship to study drug/procedure will be also summarized. 
A by-subject listing of AEs and DLTs will be provided.

174. INTRODUCTION
4.1. X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of hereditary degenerative retinal disorders with 
progressive loss of photoreceptors and accumulation of retinal pigment deposits (Hamel 
2006). Typically, patients ﬁrst experience defective dark adaptation (night blindness), 
followed by worsening of peripheral vision and progressive loss of central vision, often 
leading to legal or total blindness (Petrs-Silva and Linden 2014). RP is generally 
characterized by nyctalopia, constricted visual fields, bone spicule pigmentation of the 
fundus, photoreceptor cell dysfunction and abnormal, diminished or absent a- and b-waves on 
electroretinography (ERG) (Chang, Vaccarella et al. 2011). Fundoscopy generally appears 
normal until progression to mid-stage RP, whereby bone spicule-shaped pigment deposits in 
the mid-periphery, retinal atrophy with narrowing of vessels and moderate pallor of the optic 
nerve become apparent. With end-stage RP, widespread pigment deposits are evident, 
reaching into the macula.
X-linked RP (XLRP) is a very severe form of RP, resulting in rapid disease progression and 
severe retinal dysfunction. The worldwide prevalence of XLRP is approximately 1:30,000 to 
1:40,000 (Tee, Smith et al. 2016). Patients with XLRP typically experience onset of night 
blindness in the first decade, followed by progressive restriction of visual field and loss of 
visual acuity (VA). Most patients are legally blind by the end of the fourth decade.
To date, mutations in the following 3 genes have been identified as causes of XLRP: RP2 ; 
RP3, also known as the RP GTPase regulator (RPGR ) gene; and OFD1 (a rare cause of 
XLRP) (Webb, Parfitt et al. 2012). Approximately 75% of cases of XLRP are due to RPGR 
mutations; the worldwide prevalence of RPGR-associated XLRP is approximately 1:40,000 
to 1:53,000 (Pelletier, Jambou et al. 2007, Shu, McDowall et al. 2008). RPGR protein is 
localized to the photoreceptor-connecting cilium and to the corresponding structures 
(transition zone) in primary cilia. It is involved in different aspects of the ciliary gate, with 
trafficking, sorting of cargoes and quality control of membrane proteins (Ferrari, Di Iorio et 
al. 2011, Megaw, Soares et al. 2015, Tee, Smith et al. 2016). Loss of RPGR function in the 
retina causes the progressive loss of photoreceptors.
Visual loss associated with any retinal disorder is extremely debilitating and significantly 
impacts the patient’s quality of life. XLRP is incurable and treatment is supportive at best. 
There are no currently marketed therapies available for modifying the disease. Possible 
treatments/strategies include light avoidance, neurotrophic factors, retinal implants, electronic 
prostheses, docosahexaenoic acid with or without vitamin A and gene therapy (MacLaren, 
Pearson et al. 2006, Talcott, Ratnam et al. 2011, Zrenner, Bartz-Schmidt et al. 2011, Barry, 
Dagnelie et al. 2012, Wen, Tao et al. 2012, West, Pearson et al. 2012, Zhou, Ni et al. 2012, 
Birch, Weleber et al. 2013, Hoffman, Hughbanks-Wheaton et al. 2014, Hughbanks-Wheaton, 
Birch et al. 2014, Tee, Smi
th et al. 2016).
A significant unmet medical need exists for new and effective therapies for XLRP, especially 
those designed to halt or significantly reduce the rate of progression.
4.2. Molecular Genetics of RPGR
The short arm of the X-chromosome harbors RPGR  at Xp21.1. The RPGR  gene has multiple 
isoforms arising from alternative splicing or post-translational modification (Yan, Swain et 
al. 1998, Kirschner, Rosenberg et al. 1999, Hong and Li 2002, Schmid, Glaus et al. 2010). 
These variants are expressed in different amounts, mainly in the lung, kidney, retina
 and 
AAV8-RPGR

CONFIDENTIAL
18testes, suggesting tissue-specific splicing with specific functions in different tissues (Schmid, 
Glaus et al. 2010).
The 2 major RPGR isoforms are the constitutive variant encoded by exons 1-19 (RPGREx1-19) 
and the RPGRORF15 isoform, which consists of exons 1-14 of RPGREx1-19  followed by a 
unique C-terminal exon called open reading frame 15 (ORF15; (Tee, Smith et al. 2016)). This 
terminal is a mutational “hot spot”, as it encodes an unusual repetitive sequence of 567 amino 
acids rich in glycine and glutamic acid residues (Vervoort, Lennon et al. 2000, Tee, Smith et 
al. 2016). The RPGRORF15 isoform is only expressed in the retina, with its protein product 
localized to the photoreceptor-connecting cilium (Vervoort, Lennon et al. 2000, Hong and Li 
2002, Mavlyutov, Zhao et al. 2002, Hong, Pawlyk et al. 2003). Mutations in the RPGRORF15 
isoform are re
sponsible for approximately 60% of all cases of XLRP (Vervoort, Lennon et al. 
2000, Bellingrath, Ochakovski et al. 2017). Over 350 RPGR variants have been discovered, 
with more than half occurring in the ORF15 exon, suggesting the importance of this isoform 
in the retina (Fokkema, den Dunnen et al. 2005).
For more information on the molecular genetics of RPGR, refer to the Investigator’s 
Brochure.
4.3. Gene Therapy for Treatment of Retinal Diseases
Gene therapy is rapidly emerging as a promising approach for the treatment of incurable 
retinal diseases ( Bryant, Duker et al. 2012, Boye, Boye et al. 2013). Gene therapy medicinal 
products (GTMPs) are a type of advanced therapy medicinal product, defined as medicines 
derived from genes and cells (EMA 2018). GTMPs contain or consist of recombinant nucleic 
acid delivered via a viral vector to targeted cells. The central goal of gene therapy is to 
replace non-functional or defective genes with new genes that are fully functional so that the 
level of genetic expression can return to normal.
The eye is particularly well suited for gene therapy because of its accessibility, relative 
immune privilege status, small size, compartmentalization and the presence of a fellow eye 
(Boye, Boye et al. 2013). The eye is one of the few relatively immunologically privileged 
sites in the body, so vectors used in gene therapy are unlikely to cause a significant systemic 
immune response. Given the defined volume of the eye, the amount of viral vector needed to 
achieve a therapeutic effect will likely be small, reducing the risk of toxicity and increasing 
the likelihood of being able to manufacture quantities of vector sufficient to treat the retina. 
The eye also allows for localized treatment without intravenous delivery, thus decreasing the 
chance of systemic absorption and toxicity. Finally, the effects of localized ocular treatments 
can be easily observed and monitored for efficacy and safety, something that cannot be 
readily done with systemic conditions (Bryant, Duker et al. 2012).
The most c
ommonly used delivery system for retinal gene therapy is the adeno-associated 
virus (AAV). AAVs remain in the nucleus as episomes with no integration into the human 
genome, thereby decreasing the risk of insertional oncogenesis. AAVs elicit a minimal 
immune response and allow for stable and long-term transgene expression in different retinal 
cells, including photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, ganglion and Muller 
cells (Vandenberghe, Bell et al. 2011, Day, Byrne et al. 2014).
Numerous early phase clinical trials using AAV vectors are currently underway for potential 
treatment of various retinal diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration 
(Study Registry ID: [REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), autosomal recessive RP 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), X-linked retinoschisis, Leber congenital amaurosis ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), Leber hereditary optic neuropathy

2016)
.
4.4. Rationale for Clinical Development of AAV8-RPGR
There has been great interest in developing a GTMP to replace the defective RPGR gene in 
patients with XLRP. When designing a potential GTMP, it is essential to know that the 
transgene meets the packaging limit of the vector. Because the RPGR  ORF15 (3.46 kb) is 
within the cloning capacity of standard AAV vectors, and allows space for a choice of 
promoters, an AAV vector is a good candidate for delivery of the RPGR transgene.
Given the instability of the ORF14/15 region of RPGR, development of a stable gene therapy 
construct has proved challenging (Deng, Dyka et al. 2015, Wu, Hiriyanna et al. 2015, 
Pawlyk, Bulgakov et al. 2016). A novel GTMP, AAV8-RPGR (AAV2/8-RK.coRPGR) has 
been developed featuring a codon-optimised coding sequence of RPGRORF15, which stabilizes 
the gene therapy construct and minimizes mutations. Recent studies have shown that the 
codon-optimised RPGR (coRPGR) coding sequence features higher expression-levels than 
wild-type (WT) RPGR. This results in greater sequence stability, provides an identical protein 
product, RPGRORF15, and promotes rod and cone expression (Fischer, McClements et al. 
2017). In these studies, the pharmacodynamic effect of AAV8-RPGR was demonstrated in 
two well-characterized mouse models of XLRP, the transgenic Rpgr-/y model and the 
C57BL/6JRd9/Boc model. The former is a knockout of the entire RPGR gene, whereas the latter 
(Rd9) has a naturally occurring mutation in the ORF15 region; both mice exhibit slow outer 
retinal degeneration. Treatment with 1.5×10^9 vector genomes (vg) AAV8-RPGR appeared 
to be effective in both animal models, as evidenced by an enhanced ERG response compared 
with relevant controls. Further, treatment of C57BL/6JWT mice with 1.5×10^9 vg 
AAV8-RPGR did not lead to toxic ocular effects (Fischer, McClements et al. 2017). Results 
from the sponsor’s toxicity study also indicate that administration of the same vector 
(AAV8-RPGR) is well tolerated in male C57BL/6J mice at dose levels of 1×10^9 and 
3.54×10^9 vg/eye; results from the sponsor’s biodistribution study also support a lack of 
toxicity.
Proof-of-concept has also been demonstrated by other researchers in Rpgr null and Rpgr 
knockout mice using an AAV8 vector encoding RPGRORF15 (Wu, Hiriyanna et al. 2015, 
Pawlyk, Bulgakov et
 al. 2016). Sustained efficacy was demonstrated up to 18 months 
following a single sub-retinal injection in Rpgr-/y mice, with a dose of 1 × 10^9 vg showing 
the best outcome overall (Wu, Hiriyanna et al. 2015). However, most of the RPGR protein 
expressed in these experiments was truncated, which could have affected protein folding. No 
overt toxicity was observed in Rpgr null mice administered AAV8-RPGR at a lower dose of 
2 × 10^9 vg (Pawlyk, Bulgakov et al. 2016).
In studies conducted with AAV-2/5 vectors encoding RPGRORF15 in two naturally occurring 
canine models (XLPRA1 deletion, XLPRA2 deletion), efficacy was demonstrated up to 
3 years, depending on stage of disease (Beltran, Cideciyan et al. 2012, Beltran, Cideciyan et 
al. 2015). Photoreceptor expression of RPGR was observed after gene transfer, with effective 
preservation of photoreceptor structure and function. These studies lend to the body of 
evidence supporting the development of gene therapy for the treatment of XLRP due to 
RPGRORF15.

20In an ocular study conducted in monkeys, transgene expression following the sub-retinal 
administration of various doses of AAV2 (4 animals [4 eyes/dose]: 10^10 and 10^11) and 
AAV8 (10 animals [5 eyes/dose]: 10^8, 10^9, 10^10, and 10^11) carrying a green fluorescent 
protein transgene correlated with surgical, clinical and immunological observations 
(Vandenberghe, Bell et al. 2011). Both AAV2 and AAV8 demonstrated efficient transduction 
of transgene in the RPE, with AAV8 being markedly better at targeting photoreceptors cells. 
Efficiency of RPE transduction by AAV8 at 10^9 vg was similar to that observed with AAV2 
at a 10-fold higher dose. RPE transduction did not increase linearly at higher doses. Dose-
related immune responses to capsid were observed with each vector, and the highest dose 
(10^11 vg) resulted in retinal inflammation and thinning. Some extra-ocular (lateral 
geniculate nuclei) distribution of vector and transgene was also observed with the highest 
dose. Dose thresholds were identified to effectively deliver gene product to target cells 
without toxicity. The authors concluded that use of AAV8 at intermediate doses (~10^10) is 
likely the best approach for gene therapy trials in humans.
There are very limited published data available with AAV8 dosing in humans for 
ophthalmological indications, although two small studies are ongoing. A Phase 1/2 clinical 
trial sponsored by the National Eye Institute is currently underway to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of intravitreal AAV-RS1 vector (AAV8-scRS/IRBPhRS) gene transfer to the 
retina of patients with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) (doses unspecified). Another Phase 1/2 clinical trial sponsored by STZ eye 
trial is currently underway to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sub-retinal AAV-CNGA3 
vector (rAAV8.hCNGA3) gene transfer to the retina of patients with CNGA3-linked 
achromatopsia (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]), using doses between 1 × 10^10 
and 1 × 10^11 vg. Preliminary results from this latter study of subjects dosed with 
1 × 10^10 vg demonstrate acceptable safety (Fischer, Wilhelm et al. 2016), as do higher 
doses of up to 1 × 10^11 vg.
Given these encouraging findings, NightstaRx is developing AAV8-RPGR as a potential 
GTMP for the treatment of XLRP due to mutations in RPGR. Replacing the deficient RPGR 
in XLRP patients with new and viable RPGR is expected to slow or stop retinal degeneration 
and may improve visual function.

236. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
6.1. Overall Study Design
This is a Phase 1/2/3, first-in-human, multi-center, dose-escalation interventional study of 
AAV8-RPGR in male subjects with genetically confirmed XLRP. The study will be 
conducted in two parts: Part I is a dose escalation study, Part II is a dose-expansion study, 
with 2 doses selected from Part I based on safety and efficacy, and a third untreated group to 
allow for a controlled comparison of efficacy and safety. 
Part I will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a dose-escalation scheme. 
Part II will expand 2 doses, allowing for a broader assessment of the safety and efficacy of 
AAV8-RPGR with a larger sample size, including approximately 30 subjects randomized 
1:1:1 to a high-dose, a low-dose, or an untreated arm. Part I primarily evaluates safety, 
defined by incidence of DLTs and TEAEs over a 24-month period. Part II evaluates safety 
and efficacy, with inclusion of a primary efficacy endpoint, improvement from Baseline in 
microperimetry, evaluated at 12 months, and safety and secondary efficacy evaluated at 1-, 2-
, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months post-treatment.
Under version 6 of the protocol, Part II subjects were to be randomised into 2 active groups 
with a 2:1 allocation ratio (high dose [2.5 × 10^11 vg]: low dose [5 × 10^10 vg]). Any 
subject randomised under this version will be followed for 12 months with the ongoing visit 
schedule and the data will be analysed separately (i.e., included in the Safety Analysis Set but 
not in the Intent-to-Treat Set, See Section 12.3). 
At study completion, all Part I subjects and treated subjects in Part II will be invited to 
participate in a long-term follow-up study that will collect efficacy and safety data up to 
5 years from surgery.
Part I will consist of 11 visits over a 24-month evaluation period. Part II consists of 10 visits 
over a 12-month period. At the Screening/Baseline Visit, each subject will be assessed for 
eligibility of both eyes. Only 1 eye will receive treatment (the “study eye”), and the untreated 
eye will be designated as the “fellow eye.” Selection of the “study eye” will be made on 
clinical grounds and will generally be the worse eye affected. This will be discussed in detail 
and agreed with each subject as part of the informed consent process. Once a subject has been 
randomised, a change in “study eye” designation is not permitted.
At the Injection Day Visit (Visit 2, Day 0), subjects will undergo vitrectomy and iatrogenic 
retinal detachment as part of a sub-retinal injection procedure for administration of 
AAV8-RPGR in their study eye. To minimise inflammation resulting from surgery and/or 
vector/transgene, in Part I, all subjects will be given a 21-day course of oral corticosteroid 
(e.g., prednisolone/prednisone) that will start 2 days before the planned date of surgery (see 
Section 8.8 for details). In Part II, all subjects may be treated at the time of surgery with up to 
1 mL of triamcinolone (40 mg/mL), administered via a deep sub-Tenon approach. Subjects 
will also be given a 9-week course of oral corticosteroid starting 3 days before surgery: 
21 days at 60 mg, followed by 6 weeks of tapering doses. The dose regimen is adjusted for 
pediatric subjects treated in Part II (see Section 8.8). 
Subjects in t
he untreated control group will receive study-visit telephone calls to monitor 
AEs/SAEs and review concomitant medications on Visit 2 (Day 0) and on Visits 3 and 4 
(post-operative Days 1 and 7).
Subjects will be assessed for safety and efficacy throughout the study as indicated in the 
Schedule of Study Procedures (see Section 16.1). The safety evaluation will be based on the

24occurrence of adverse event (AE) reporting (including DLTs); full ophthalmic examination 
(including indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure [IOP], 
anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation grading and lens opacities classification system 
III [LOCS III] cataract grading); fundus photography; vital signs; and laboratory assessments 
(including laboratory safety parameters, viral shedding and immunogenicity).
The efficacy evaluation will be based on microperimetry, BCVA, SD-OCT, fundus 
autofluorescence, visual fields (Octopus 900 specified in Part II only), contrast sensitivity, 
low luminance visual acuity (LLVA),  
. Any safety information collected as a result of the 
efficacy assessments (e.g., BCVA) will also be used in the overall safety evaluation, as 
applicable.
Subjects who develop cataracts may undergo cataract surgery if deemed clinically necessary; 
if surgery is performed, it should be carried out at least 4 weeks before their final visit.
A Part I subject is considered to have completed the study if he completes the Month 24 
assessments. Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if Part I subjects are 
unable to attend their final 24-month visit during the protocol-defined window, they should 
return to the site to complete this visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so. Delays will 
be identified as protocol deviations (PDs) on a case-by-case basis by the Sponsor based on 
information provided by the site; this will include but is not limited to scenarios such as site 
closure, travel bans, medical travel prohibitions, patient illness, etc.
A Part II subject is considered to have completed the study if he completes the Month 12 
assessments. Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if Part II subjects are 
unable to attend their final 12-month visit during the protocol-defined window, they should 
return to the site to complete this visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so. Delays will 
be identified as PDs on a case-by-case basis by the Sponsor based on information provided 
by the site; this will include but is not limited to scenarios such as site closure, travel bans, 
medical travel prohibitions, patient illness, etc.
During Part II, a single administrative interim analysis (IA) may be conducted. If this IA is 
performed, the study will continue as planned in a masked fashion. 
The end of the study is the date the last subject completes his final-visit assessments, or early 
termination [ET] assessments in the event of premature discontinuation,  or the date of last 
data collection if the last subject is lost to follow-up.
6.1.1. Dose-Limiting Toxicity

and should be reported to the sponsor:
Sustained decrease in BCVA of ≥30 letters on the Early Treatment of Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart compared to baseline; sustained is defined as 
lasting 48 hours or more until recovery, with recovery defined as visual acuity 
(VA) returning to within 10 letters of baseline VA. An exception is made for 
surgery-related events occurring in close temporal association (within <24 hours) 
of the surgery.
Vitreous inflammation, vitritis (>Grade 3 using standardised Nussenblatt vitreous 
inflammation scale grading) (Nussenblatt, Palestine et al. 1985)

25Any clinically significant retinal damage observed (e.g., retinal atrophy) that is not 
directly attributed to complications of surgery
Any clinically relevant suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (as defined 
in the Investigator’s Brochure), with the exception of vision loss or vision-
threatening events (as defined in Section 11.2.1.2)
When triplicate BCVA assessments are performed at screening, the median BCVA result will 
be used for change-from-baseline BCVA computation.
If a DLT occurs at any time during the study, the site is to report the event to the sponsor 
within 24 hours of occurrence. A DLT will be reported by the investigational site, to the 
sponsor via a DLT/serious adverse event (SAE) reporting form that must be completed as 
fully as possible and emailed to  within 24 hours of being made aware 
of the event. Only 1 DLT/SAE form must be completed for each DLT.
6.1.2. Part I: Dose-Escalation Study
The study will use a 3+3 escalation scheme (Storer 1989) for administration of 
AAV8-RPGR; a schematic diagram of the escalation scheme is displayed in Figure 1.
Figure 1 3+3 Dose-Escalation Study
DLT: dose-limiting toxicity; MTD: maximum tolerated dose 
Each dose level and potential DLTs will be reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. Data 
reviews will occur when at least 3 subjects have been dosed at a particular level or if/when 2 subjects have a 
DLT, whichever comes first. For making decisions regarding dose escalation, the DMC will review safety data 
collected for at least 4 weeks from each subject dosed at a particular level as well as cumulative safety data 
collected from previously dosed cohorts.
Part I of the study will involve up to 6 dose cohorts, with AAV8-RPGR doses of 5 × 10^9 vg 
(Cohort 1), 1 × 10^10 vg (Cohort 2), 5 × 10^10 vg (Cohort 3), and 1 x 10^11 vg (Cohort 4), Treat 3

262.5 × 10^11 vg (Cohort 5), and 5 × 10^11 vg (Cohort 6). Each eligible subject will receive 
AAV8-RPGR in their study eye and will be monitored for DLTs.
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be used to review safety data 
before confirming whether escalation to a higher dose level can occur. There is a potential for 
surgical complications resulting in safety events that meet the criteria for a DLT. In such 
cases, the DMC will make the final adjudication as to whether the event is a DLT.
The DMC will review safety data for each cohort when at least 3 subjects have been dosed at 
a particular level. However, if 2 subjects within a cohort have a DLT(s), dosing will not 
proceed to subsequent subjects until safety data are reviewed by the DMC.
For making decisions regarding dose escalation, the DMC will review safety data collected 
for at least 4 weeks from each subject in the last dosed cohort. In addition, the DMC will 
review cumulative safety data collected from all previously dosed cohorts and take these 
findings into consideration when making decisions on dose escalation.
There will be a minimum of 4 weeks between each subject dosed in Cohort 1. Unless 
otherwise specified by the DMC, there will be no restrictions on the interval between subjects 
being dosed in Cohort 2 onwards.
Three to 6 subjects are planned per dose cohort; however, the actual number of subjects 
enrolled into each cohort will depend on the toxicity observed. If no DLTs are observed in 
the first 3 subjects treated within a cohort, then escalation to the next dose cohort can 
proceed. If 1 DLT is reported within a 3-subject cohort, an additional 3 subjects will be 
treated at the same dose. If there are no further DLTs reported in the additional 3 subjects, 
then escalation to the next dose cohort can proceed. If ≥2 subjects within a cohort (3 or 
6 subjects) have a DLT(s), then the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be identified as the 
previous (lower) dose. If ≥2 subjects with a DLT are reported within Cohort 1 (3 or 
6 subjects), then dosing will cease under this protocol and further investigation may occur 
following a protocol amendment.
Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if Part I subjects are unable to 
attend their final 24-month visit during the protocol-defined window, they should return to 
the site to complete this visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so. This will be 
considered their 24-month visit. Delays will be identified as PDs on a case-by-case basis by 
the Sponsor based on information provided by the site; this will include but is not limited to 
scenarios such as site closure, travel bans, medical travel prohibitions, patient illness, etc.
6.1.3. Part II Dose-Expansion, Version 6 
Under version 6 of the protocol, Part II subjects were to be randomised into 2 active groups 
with a 2:1 allocation ratio (high dose [2.5 × 10^11 vg]: low dose [5 × 10^10 vg]). Any 
subject randomised under this version will be followed for 12 months with the ongoing visit 
schedule and the data will be analysed separately  (i.e., included in the Safety Analysis Set 
but not in the Intent to Treat Set, See Section 12.3). 
Enrollment under Version 6.0 has been superseded by the 3-arm randomisation ongoing since 
Version 7. 
6.1.4. Part II: Dose Expansion  
From version 9.0 thereafter, approximately 30 additional subjects will be randomized in a 
1:1:1 allocation ratio to a high-dose group (2.5 × 10^11 vg), a low-dose group (5 × 10^10 vg), 
and an untreated group.

27Study data will be collected for both eyes of each subject. Since treatment requires an 
invasive surgical procedure under general anesthesia, the sponsor, investigator and the 
subject will be unmasked to the study procedure (i.e., vitrectomy and sub-retinal injection), 
however within the treated groups, the sponsor, investigator and subject will be masked to the 
assigned dose. To further minimise potential bias of the treated and non-treated eye 
evaluations, all subjective ophthalmic assessments at the Screening/Baseline Visit (Visit 1) 
and from Month 3 (Visit 6) onwards will be conducted by a masked assessor.
During Part II, a single administrative IA may be conducted. If this IA is performed, the 
study will continue as planned in a masked fashion. A final analysis will be conducted at the 
end of the study, i.e., after all subjects complete the study. The end of the study is defined as 
the date the last subject completes his final-visit assessments, or early termination [ET] 
assessments in the event of premature discontinuation, or the date of last data collection if the 
last subject is lost to follow-up. See Section 12.8 for further details.
Although the vi
sit will still be considered out-of-window, if Part II subjects are unable to 
attend their final 12-month visit during the protocol-defined window, they should return to 
the site to complete this visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so. This will be 
considered their 12-month visit. Delays will be identified as PDs on a case-by-case basis by 
the Sponsor based on information provided by the site; this will include but is not limited to 
scenarios such as site closure, travel bans, medical travel prohibitions, patient illness, etc.
6.2. Number of Subjects
Overall, the study is expected to enroll approximately 48 subjects: 18 in Part I and 
approximately 30 in Part II under 1:1:1 randomization scheme. See Section 12.1 for rationale. 
6.3. Discussion of Study Design and Dose Selection
Guidelines published by the EMA and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on mitigating 
risks in first-in-human studies and use of gene therapy in clinical trials were used in the 
design of this study (EMA 1994, EMA 2007, FDA 2015, EMA 2016, EMA 2018). An 
independent DMC will be used to review safety data before any dose escalation decisions are 
made.
The subjects to be included in the study are representative of active XLRP disease and are 
being selected to optimize observance of meaningful change in the outcome measures. The 
planned sample size in Part I is consistent with a 3+3 escalation scheme. A prospective trial 
period of 24 months for Part I is considered to be a sufficient period of time to monitor for 
any AEs related to the vector and/or transgene/administration procedure. 
The starting dose being used in this clinical study is 5 × 10^9 vg AAV8-RPGR. This dose is 
primarily based on human equivalent doses (calculated on the basis of vitreous volume) from 
the AAV8-RPGR 26-week single-dose toxicity and biodistribution studies conducted by the 
sponsor and the mouse studies conducted at the University of Oxford (Fischer, McClements 
et al. 2017). In the Fischer studies, treatment with 1.5 × 10^9 vg AAV8-RPGR did not lead to 
toxic ocular effects in C57BL/6JWT. Results from the sponsor’s toxicity and biodistribution 
studies indicate that AAV8-RPGR is well tolerated in male C57BL/6J mice at dose levels of 
1 × 10^9 vg/eye and 3.54 × 10^9 vg/eye. The NOAEL was determined to be 
3.54 × 10^9 vg/eye in mice, providing a 700-fold safety margin compared to the starting 
dose.
The second and third dose levels in this study are 1 × 10^10 and 5 × 10^10 vg. These dose 
increments are less than a 1-log increase from the previous dose levels (i.e., 5 × 10^9 and 
AAV8-RPGR

CONFIDENTIAL
281 × 10^10 vg respectively), considering the possibility of a narrow safe range for RPGR 
expression. Smaller dose increments were not expected to add meaningful information. 
Further, in a monkey study, dose thresholds of AAV8-GFP (an AAV8 virus particle encoding 
green fluorescence protein) were identified to effectively deliver gene product to target cells 
without toxicity, with the highest safe dose identified as 1 × 10^10 vg (Vandenberghe, Bell et 
al. 2011). In an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of sub-
retinal AAV-CNGA3 vector (rAAV8.hCNGA3) in patients with CNGA3-linked 
achromatopsia, patients receive vector at doses between 1 × 10^10 and 1 × 10^11 vg 
(Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]). Preliminary results from this clinical study in 
subjects dosed with 1 × 10^10 vg demonstrate acceptable safety (Fischer, Wilhelm et al. 
2016), as do higher doses of up to 1 × 10^11vg.
The fourth (1×10^11 vg), fifth and sixth (2.5 × 10^11 and 5 × 10^11 vg) dose levels are less 
than a 0.5- log increase from the previous dose levels, ensuring a more conservative approach 
at the upper end of the dose-exploration range. The NOAEL in mice provides a 7-fold safety 
margin compared to the clinical maximum dose (5 × 10^11 vg).
Further details are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.Given previous experience 
demonstrating the safety of higher subretinal doses of AAV8 vector (Vandenberghe, Bell et 
al. 2011), and lacking safety signals at the lower range of doses, it should be possible to dose-
escalate to the high end of the dose range of AAV8-RPGR.
Application of AAV8-RPGR to the under-surface of the retina requires retinal detachment 
following vitrectomy. As such, sub-retinal injection of AAV8-RPGR carries the risks 
associated with vitrectomy and retinal detachment, which include intra-operative and post-
operative complications: infection (most notably infectious endophthalmitis); low and 
elevated IOP; choroidal detachment; macular oedema; vitreous haemorrhage; visual 
impairment; metamorphopsia; and photopsia ( Park, Marcus et al. 1995, Thompson, Sjaarda et 
al. 1996, Banker, Freeman et al. 1997, Cheng, Azen et al. 2001, Anderson, Fineman et al. 
2006, Stein, Zacks et al. 2009, Recchia, Scott et al. 2010). Post-operative intraocular 
inflammation caused by vitrectomy is often associated with transient visual impairment. A 
long-term complication of vitrectomy is cataract formation, which may require an additional 
surgical procedure (cataract extraction) (Park, Marcus et al. 1995, Cheng, Azen et al. 2001, 
Recchia, Scott et al. 2010). To minimise inflammation resulting from potential immune 
responses to vector, subjects receiving AAV8-RPGR will be given a course of oral 
corticosteroid (see Section 8.8 for details). 
Once Part I dose-escalation has been completed, and the safety and tolerability of 
AAV8-RPGR is demonstrated in adults, subjects ≥10 years of age will be enrolled in Part II 
of the study. The 10-years of age cut-off safeguards that participating pediatric subjects will 
be able to comply, adequately perform study assessments, and have sufficiently advanced 
disease that is encroaching on the macula (i.e., the AAV8-RPGR treatment administration 
area).
In Part II, subjects will be randomized to a high-dose (2.5 × 10^11 vg), a low-dose 
(5 × 10^10 vg), and an untreated group. This allows for comparisons in a randomized and 
controlled fashion, as recommended by regulators for best practices in ophthalmic gene 
therapy studies (FDA 2018). The sponsor, investigator and the subject will be unmasked to 
the study procedure and treatment (i.e. vitrectomy and sub-retinal injection). However, within 
the treated groups, the sponsor, investigator, and subject will be masked (i.e. double-masked) 
to the assigned dose. To further minimise potential bias of the treated and non-treated eye

If a subject discontinues the study, the reason for withdrawal is to be recorded in the eCRF. 
In the event that a subject discontinues the study early, the site should use every reasonable 
effort to ensure that an ET Visit is conducted as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures 
(see Section 16.1). If the subject is withdrawn due to an AE, the investigator will arrange for 
follow-up until the event has resolved or stabilized. For subjects who withdraw 
consent/assent, data will be collected through their last available study visit. 
Withdrawal from the study will not result in the exclusion of a subject’s data acquired up to 
the point of withdrawal. 
The study may be discontinued if the Sponsor deems it necessary for medical, safety, 
regulatory or other reasons consistent with applicable laws or regulations.

328. STUDY TREATMENT
8.1. Treatments Administered
Part I, Dose Escalation, Phase 1: all subjects will undergo vitrectomy and retinal detachment 
in their study eye and then receive a single, sub-retinal injection of AAV8-RPGR (See 
Section 8.4 for details). Subjects will receive an AAV8-RPGR dose of 5 × 10^9 vg 
(Cohort 1), 1 × 10^10 vg (Cohort 2), 5 × 10^10 vg (Cohort 3), 1 x 10^11 vg (Cohort 4), 
2.5 × 10^11 vg (Cohort 5), or 5 x 10^11 vg (Cohort 6). See Section 6.1.2 for details.
Part II, Dose Expansion, Phase 2/3: Subjects will be assigned to 1 of the following: high-dose 
(2.5 × 10^11 vg), low-dose (5 × 10^10 vg), or an untreated control arm.
8.2. Description of Study Drug
The drug substance is the AAV8 vector containing recombinant human complementary 
deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) encoding RPGR (AAV8-RPGR). The vector genome 
(AAV8-coRPGR-BGH, known as AAV8-RPGR) is comprised of a strong constitutive 
expression cassette, a rhodopsin kinase promoter, the codon-optimised human cDNA 
encoding RPGR (coRPGR), and a bovine growth hormone (BGH)-polyA sequence flanked 
by AAV2 inverted terminal repeats. The codon-optimised human coding sequence of the 
retina-specific isoform RPGRORF15 was synthesized; the WT sequence of RPGRORF15 was 
also synthesized and provided in a pCMV6-XL vector backbone or in a pUC57 vector 
backbone for cloning. 
The AAV8-RPGR drug product is formulated in a sterile, 20 mM Tris-buffered solution, 
pH 8.0, and contains 1 mM MgCl 2, 200 mM NaCl, and 0.001% Pluronic F-68 (PF68). The 
drug product is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless, sterile-filtered suspension with a 
target concentration of 5 × 10^12 vg/mL.
8.3. Packaging, Labeling, Preparation and Storage
AAV8-RPGR will be supplied in labelled sterile polypropylene tubes, with each tube 
containing 0.3 mL vector suspension. Thus, each tube will contain 1.5 × 10^12 vg in total.
AAV8-RPGR will be delivered in a total volume of up to 0.1 mL. Instructions for preparation 
and dilution of drug product to deliver the desired dose of AAV8-RPGR will be provided in 
the pharmacy manual.
Prior to shipment, each vial will be placed in a labelled secondary container. The drug 
product is to be stored at <−60oC (<−76oF) in a controlled access, temperature monitored 
freezer.
The Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) will be labelled in compliance with regulatory 
standards.
8.4. Vitrectomy Procedure and Injection of AAV8-RPGR
The subretinal injection technique to be used in this study is similar to that developed in the 
sponsor’s choroideremia programme in Oxford and other international investigator-sponsored 
trials in the United States, Canada and Germany. To date, over 200 subjects have been 
injected without complication by retinal surgeons using the technique described below.
All subjects may be treated at the time of surgery with up to 1 mL of triamcinolone 
(40 mg/mL), administered via a deep sub-Tenon approach.
AAV8-RPGR
Protocol: NSR-RPGR-01Version 11.0

CONFIDENTIAL
33Injection of AAV8-RPGR is to be performed by an appropriately qualified and experienced 
retinal surgeon. All surgeons must have completed all study-specific surgical training and 
obtained certification by NightstaRx to perform the study procedure, before treating a study 
participant.
Initially, subjects will undergo a standard vitrectomy and detachment of the posterior hyaloid 
(Figure 2). All surgery will be conducted using the standard BIOM vitrectomy system. A 
23-gauge sutured approach is usually favored to avoid any potential risks of wound leakage. 
Prior to sub-retinal injection of AAV8-RPGR, the retina will be detached with 0.1-0.5 mL of 
balanced salt solution (BSS) injected through a 41-gauge sub-retinal cannula connected to a 
vitreous injection set. A single dose of AAV8-RPGR will be injected into the sub-retinal fluid 
through the same entry site. If detachment of the macula occurs with a smaller volume of 
fluid, then additional subretinal sites in the posterior globe (e.g., nasal to the disc) may also 
be chosen to deliver up to the entire 0.1 ml of vector. This avoids excessive foveal stretch.
If unexpected complications of retinal detachment are encountered (e.g., macular hole created 
requiring treatment with gas), the injection of vector can be deferred until a later date.
Subjects will be carefully monitored for the occurrence of AEs peri- and post-operatively. All 
AEs, irrespective of relationship to the study drug and/or the surgical procedure will be 
captured in the subject’s medical record and reported in the eCRF.

348.5. Randomisation
Part I, the dose-escalation portion of this study, is open-label and not randomized. 
In Part II, after the study eye is assigned, subjects will be randomised to 1 of 3 groups with a 
1:1:1 allocation ratio: 1) treatment with AAV8-RPGR at a high dose (2.5 × 10^11 vg); 
2) treatment with AAV8-RPGR at a low dose (5 × 10^10 vg) or 3) no treatment. Once a 
subject has been randomized, a change in “study eye” designation is not permitted. 
Randomisation will be generated using a validated system that automates the random 
assignment of treatment groups to randomisation numbers. Once a subject is deemed eligible, 
the investigative site (or authorized designee) will access the system, and the subject will be 
randomised using a standard blocked randomisation. The randomisation number will include 
the center number and subject number.
8.6. Study Masking
Part I of the study is open label.
Part II is double-masked (subject, surgeon, investigator/site team, and sponsor will be 
masked) to the assigned dose, and open-label with respect to the treatment procedure.
In Part II, ophthalmic assessments that will be used as efficacy endpoints (BCVA, LLVA, 
microperimetry, contrast sensitivity ) will be conducted by appropriately 
qualified assessors (see Table 1). For the immediate post-operative visits, masking of the 
assessors will not be viable as clinical signs of surgery will be apparent (i.e., redness, 
swelling). Therefore, unmasked assessors will perform all ophthalmic assessments at Visit 3 
(Day 1), Visit 4 (Day 7), Visit 5 (Month 1), and Visit 5.9 (Month 2). From Visit 6 (Month 3) 
onwards, masked assessors will be used, as signs of surgery will have dissipated and it should 
not be possible clinically to differentiate between those subjects that have not undergone 
surgery, and those subjects that have undergone surgery and received active treatment. It is 
preferable that the same assessor who performed the efficacy endpoint assessments at 
Screening/Baseline also perform the assessments during the masked period from Month 3 to 
Month 12. 
Table 1 Masked Assessments of Efficacy 
Masked Assessments at Month 3, 6, 9 and 12 Post-Treatment with AAV8-RPGR
Best-corrected visual acuity
Low-luminance visual acuity
Microperimetry
Contrast sensitivity

Subjects randomised to the untreated Control group will not be required to attend the site at 
Visit 2, 3 or 4. As the key purpose of Visit 2 is surgery, and Visit 3 and 4 are post-operative 
safety visits, there is limited utility in Control subjects attending. Therefore, to limit the study 
burden for Control subjects thereby potentially reducing the risk of subject withdrawal at this 
stage and reducing the possibility of further unmasking due to direct contact and 
communication with fellow participants, Control subjects are not scheduled to attend the 
clinic for study visits at these times.
To minimise bias further, masked assessors will not have access to the subject’s medical 
records, source documentation or eCRF as data entries or notation (such as use of peri-

AAV8-RPGR

35operative corticosteroid) may be sources of unmasking. From Visit 6 (Month 3) onwards, the 
masked assessor will also read a pre-written statement to each subject, regardless of 
randomisation, reminding them of the masked nature of the study, and to avoid any reference 
to prior surgery/non-surgery, which eye may have received treatment or to allude to any 
information that may unmask the assessor as to which group the subject has been assigned to. 
Furthermore, it is anticipated that a subset of the subjects participating in the trial will be 
active on social media. Following appropriate approval by the Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB), the patient information leaflet will request that 
subjects refrain from posting any details of study participation on social media, that may 
unmask the assessors to the group the subject has been assigned to. This request will be 
reiterated at subject visits by the investigator and within the pre-written statement.
Subjects randomised to the AAV8-RPGR treatment groups, surgeons, the investigative team, 
and the study sponsor will be masked to which dose of AAV8-RPGR the subject has been 
assigned to. Unmasked study site personnel will be assigned the responsibility of performing 
dilution, which will take place in a designated area remote from the investigative team to 
preserve masking of the treatment arm. Personnel delegated to perform the dilution will not 
be involved in any other aspect of the study (i.e., consent, safety/efficacy assessments, 
surgical procedure).
During Part II, a single administrative IA may be performed. If this IA is performed, the 
study will continue as planned in a masked fashion. 
8.7. Study Drug Accountability
Records of the receipt and dispensing of study drug will be kept by each study center until the 
end of the study to provide complete accounting of all used and unused study drug. 
Dispensation logs will be checked by the Sponsor (or its designee). Study centers will destroy 
all used vials in accordance with local procedures and will return all unused study drug to the 
Sponsor (or its designee) at the end of the study. Final drug accountability will be verified by 
the Sponsor (or its designee).
8.8. Concomitant Therapy
Subjects cannot have participated in another research study involving an investigational 
product in the past 12 weeks or received a gene/cell-based therapy at any time previously 
(including, but not limited to, IRIS implantation, ciliary neurotrophic factor therapy, nerve 
growth factor therapy).
Throughout the study, subjects may be prescribed any concomitant medications, procedures 
and/ or treatments deemed necessary for the subjects’ ongoing medical care. Details of 
medications, treatments and procedures will be collected at the Screening/Baseline Visit and 
updated at every study visit (including the ET Visit, if applicable). Concomitant medications 
(including prednisone/prednisolone), treatments and procedures taken/undergone during the 
study are to be recorded in the subject’s medical records and eCRF; an exception to this is 
any medication used in the course of conducting a study assessment (e.g., topical anesthesia, 
dilating eye drops).
To minimise inflammation resulting from surgery and potential or unexpected immune 
responses to vector/transgene, all subjects will be treated with a course of corticosteroid 
therapy.

36In Part I, all subjects will be prescribed a 21-day course of oral prednisone/prednisolone 
following closely the 17-day protocol established in the voretigene neparvovec-rzyl AAV 
gene therapy clinical trial for treatment of patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-
associated retinal dystrophy (Maguire, Simonelli et al. 2008), allowing an extra 4 days for 
tapering the dose at the end of the course, i.e., 1 mg/kg/day prednisone/prednisolone for a 
total of 10 days (beginning 2 days before the vector injection, on the day of injection, and 
then for 7 days); followed by 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days; 0.25 mg/kg/day for 2 days; and 
0.125 mg/kg/day for 2 days (21 days in total).
In Part II, all subjects will be prescribed a course of oral corticosteroids. In addition, at the 
time of surgery, subjects (adult and pediatric) may be treated with up to 1 mL of 
triamcinolone, 40 mg/mL solution, which must be administered via a deep sub-Tenon 
approach. 
For adults, 60 mg of oral prednisone/prednisolone will be prescribed for the initial 21 days 
(starting 3 days prior to surgery), followed by a weekly taper as follows, for a total of 
9 weeks of treatment:
Day -3 through day 17 (21 days): 60 mg by mouth once daily
Day 18 through day 24 (7 days): 50 mg by mouth once daily
Day 25 through day 31 (7 days): 40 mg by mouth once daily
Day 32 through day 38 (7 days): 30 mg by mouth once daily
Day 39 through day 45 (7 days): 20 mg by mouth once daily
Day 46 through day 52 (7 days): 10 mg by mouth once daily
Day 53 through day 59 (7 days): 5 mg by mouth once daily. 
If at the Month-2 visit (Visit 5.9), inflammation is observed, corticosteroid therapy should be 
re-initiated, via oral and/or intraocular route, based on the clinical condition of the subject, 
and the judgement of the investigator.
For pediatric subjects, oral prednisolone/prednisone will also be started 3 days prior to 
surgery. The starting dose will be based on kilogram weight of the subject, up to a maximum 
of 60 mg starting dose (rounded to the nearest 1 mg). Subsequent doses will have multipliers 
to provide the appropriate taper over an additional 6 weeks, for a total of 9 weeks of 
treatment. See tapering regimen for pediatric subjects below:
Day -3 through day 17 (21 days): Starting Dose (SD) 1 mg/kg by mouth/ once daily 
(maximum dose of 60 mg once daily)
Day 18 through day 24 (7 days): SD X 0.83 mg by mouth once daily
Day 25 through day 31 (7 days): SD X 0.67 mg by mouth once daily
Day 32 through day 38 (7 days): SD X 0.5 mg by mouth once daily
Day 39 through day 45 (7 days): SD X 0.33 mg by mouth once daily
Day 46 through day 52 (7 days): SD X 0.17 mg by mouth once daily
Day 53 through day 59 (7 days): SD X 0.08 mg by mouth once daily
If at the Month-2 visit (Visit 5.9), inflammation is observed, corticosteroid therapy should be 
reinitiated, via oral and/or intraocular route, based on the clinical condition of the subject, and 
the judgement of the investigator.

37The local pediatric team should be involved with all children undergoing gene therapy 
surgery and should be available to give advice on the steroid doses used in each patient. 
Modifications of the protocol-defined steroid treatment are allowed based on the 
recommendation of the pediatric team, with approval from the Sponsor.
For all subjects: while subjects are taking oral steroids, special note should be made to follow 
for potential side effects (e.g., increased IOP, cataracts, hypertension, elevated blood sugar, 
infections, gastritis/peptic ulcer disease, edema, electrolyte imbalance, mood changes, 
insomnia), and appropriate prophylaxis and/or therapy should be instituted as needed (e.g., 
treatment with proton pump inhibitors, valacyclovir; restriction of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory agents).
8.9. Treatment Compliance
This study involves a single sub-retinal injection of up to 0.1 mL AAV8-RPGR. Measure of 
treatment compliance with AAV8-RPGR is therefore not necessary. The exact volume 
injected at the time of surgery should be recorded on the eCRF.
Compliance with the use of prednisone/prednisolone will be captured in the eCRF.

389. STUDY VISITS AND PROCEDURES
The schedule of study procedures is presented in Table 3, Section 16.1.
9.1. Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline Period)
The investigator will explain the study purpose, procedures, and subject responsibilities to 
each potential study subject. The subject's willingness and ability to meet the protocol 
requirements will be determined.
Prior to any study-specific procedure, written informed consent will be obtained. The subject 
or parent / legal guardian will sign and date 1 copy of the consent form in the presence of the 
investigator or his/her designee; where applicable, an assent form will be completed by the 
subject. The original signed form(s) will be retained at the study site and an additional copy 
will remain in the subject’s medical records; a copy will also be given to the subject or parent 
/ legal guardian. 
After informed consent/assent has been obtained, the subject will be evaluated to determine 
eligibility. Screening assessments will be considered baseline measurements and will consist 
of the following:
Demography
Medical history, including ocular history
Blood pressure and pulse
Collection of safety blood samples (hematology and clinical chemistry)

39Randomisation6
1. In Part II, it is preferable that the same masked assessor who performs these assessments 
(LLVA, BCVA, microperimetry, contrast sensitivity and ) during the masked period from 
Month 3 through Month 12 also perform these assessments at screening.
2. For Part I subjects, BCVA is performed in triplicate at baseline. For Part II subjects, if the 
BCVA value at Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline) is ≥ ± 10 letter gain or loss in the study eye compared 
to the previous XOLARIS study visit (if applicable), then BCVA must be repeated an additional 2 
times, resulting in a total of 3 BCVA measures at Visit 1. 
For Part II subjects, if the BCVA value at Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline) is < ± 10 letter difference in 
the study eye compared to the previous XOLARIS study visit, then BCVA will be collected once 
and will not be repeated.
If subject was not previously in XOLARIS study, BCVA assessments at baseline must be 
performed in triplicate.
For all subjects who require triplicate BCVA testing, to facilitate the additional BCVA measures, 
this visit should be conducted over 2 days, with BCVA measured twice on Day 1 and once on Day 
2 (prior to pupil dilation). All 3 BCVA values must be recorded in the eCRF. The highest score 
will be used to define subject eligibility.
3. Assessments at screening collected in triplicate. To facilitate triplicate testing, the visit should 
be conducted over 2 days. Visual field and microperimetry outputs will be sent to a CRC for 
review. Data will be generated and collated within the CRC and exported to the Sponsor or 
designee. For microperimetry, the last assessment performed during screening will be used for 
assessing eligibility and will be defined as the baseline assessment.
4. Octopus 900 perimeter is specified for visual field assessments only in Part II. 
 
6. Part II only. 
 
 
Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will have a 
study eye assigned and be enrolled into the study. In Part II, subjects will be informed of the 
randomisation outcome (i.e., AAV8-RPGR treatment or the Control group) and instructed to 
not reveal their treatment group assignment to the masked assessors during the study. 
Subjects randomised to the AAV8-RPGR treatment groups (along with the Investigators and 
sponsor) will remain masked to the assigned dose.
See Section 8.5 for details on randomisation and assignment of subject numbers.
The next study visit (Visit 2) is to be scheduled within 12 weeks of the Screening/Baseline 
Visit. Subjects will be given a course of oral prednisone/prednisolone and instructed to start 
taking the drug 2 days (Part I) or 3 days (Part II) before their next study visit (Visit 2). Where 
applicable, subjects will also be instructed to use barrier contraception or abstain from sexual 
intercourse for a period of 3 months from the time they are treated.
9.2. Visit 2 (Day 0, Surgery/Injection Day Visit)
At Visit 2, all subjects in the AAV8-RPGR groups will visit the surgical site, and the 
following assessments will be performed prior to surgery:
Full ophthalmic examination, including indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit lamp 
examination with IOP assessment, anterior chamber, and vitreous inflammation 
grading, and LOCS III cataract grading

4810. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY
All efforts should be made to conduct the efficacy assessments; if a subject is not able to 
perform an assessment due to poor VA, it will be documented accordingly in the eCRF and 
will not be recorded as a protocol deviation.
10.1. Best-Corrected Visual Acuity
To evaluate changes in VA over the study period, BCVA will be assessed for both eyes using 
the ETDRS VA chart at the times indicated in Table 3, Section 16.1.
The BCVA test should be performed prior to pupil dilation, and distance refraction should be 
carried out before BCVA is measured. Initially, letters are read at a distance of 4 meters from 
the chart. If <20 letters are read at 4 meters, testing at 1 meter should be performed. BCVA is 
to be reported as number of letters read correctly by the subject. 
In Part I, at the Screening/Baseline Visit, eyes will be eligible for the study if they:
Have better than or equal to light perception (Cohort 1 only), or
Have a BCVA of 34-73 ETDRS letters (equivalent to worse than or equal to 6/12 
or 20/40 Snellen acuity, but better than or equal to 6/60 or 20/200 Snellen acuity) 
(Cohorts 2-3)
Have a BCVA better than or equal to 34 ETDRS letters (equivalent to better than 
or equal to 6/60 or 20/200 Snellen acuity) (Cohort 4 [5 and 6, if applicable] and 
MTD cohort)
In Part II, at the Screening/Baseline Visit, eyes will be eligible for the study if they have a 
BCVA better than or equal to 34 ETDRS letters.
For BCVA, assessors will be appropriately qualified for conducting the assessment. 
For Part I subjects, BCVA will be performed in triplicate over a 2-day period at Visits 1, 9 
and 11 (or ET Visit) for all subjects. It is recommended that BCVA will be conducted twice 
on the first day and once on the second day. All values will be entered in the eCRF.
For Part II subjects, if the BCVA value at Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline) is ≥ ± 10 letter gain or 
loss in the study eye compared to the previous XOLARIS study visit (if applicable), then 
BCVA must be repeated an additional 2 times, resulting in a total of 3 BCVA measures at 
Visit 1. To facilitate the additional BCVA measures this visit should be conducted over 2 
days, with BCVA measured twice on Day 1 and once on Day 2 (prior to pupil dilation). All 
3 BCVA values must be recorded in the eCRF. The highest score will be used to determine 
subject eligibility.
If the BCVA value at Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline) is < ± 10 letter difference in the study eye 
compared to the previous XOLARIS study visit, then BCVA will be collected once and will 
not be repeated.
If subject was not previously in XOLARIS study, BCVA assessments at baseline must be 
performed in triplicate.
In Part II, it is preferable that the same masked assessor who performs the BCVA 
assessments during the masked period from Month 3 through Month 12 also perform these 
assessments at screening.

4910.2. Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT)
SD-OCT will be performed for both eyes at the times indicated in Table 3, Section 16.1. SD-
OCT measurements will be taken by certified technicians at the site after dilation of the 
subject’s pupil. All OCT scans will be submitted by the sites to a Central Reading Centre 
(CRC) where the scans will be evaluated; the CRC will enter the data into the Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) system. SD-OCT will be used to quantify integrity of the EZ and reduction in 
the signal from the outer nuclear layer and choroid. In addition, foveal changes will be 
assessed.
For complete technical specifications for SD-OCT, refer to the Study Operations Manual 
(which will include procedures from the CRC regarding how measurements are to be taken).
10.3. Fundus Autofluorescence
To assess changes in the area of viable retinal tissue, fundus autofluorescence will be 
performed for both eyes at the times indicated in Table 3, Section 16.1. All fundus 
autofluorescence images will be performed by certified technicians at the site after dilation of 
the subject’s pupil and sent to a CRC for review; the CRC will enter the data into the EDC 
system. For complete technical specifications for fundus autofluorescence, refer to the Study 
Operations Manual (which will include procedures from the CRC regarding how 
measurements are to be taken).
10.4. MAIA Microperimetry
MAIA Microperimetry will be conducted for both eyes at the times indicated in Table 3, 
Section 16.1. MAIA microperimetry will be conducted by certified technicians to assess 
changes in retinal sensitivity within the macula. Microperimetry must be performed on both 
eyes in triplicate and should be conducted over a 2-day period at Visit 1 for all subjects. The 
final assessment should be used to determine subject eligibility. If at subsequent visits there 
are obvious technical challenges or the subject is not performing the assessment as expected 
from previous visits (e.g. distracted, large number of false positive responses, not maintaining 
fixation, etc), then the assessment may be repeated and the second assessment should be used 
for that study visit.
All microperimetry images will be sent by the sites to a CRC for review. For complete 
technical specifications for microperimetry, refer to the Study Operations Manual (which will

In Part II, it is preferable that the same masked assessor who performs the microperimetry 
assessments during the masked period from Month 3 through Month 12 also perform these 
assessments at screening. 
10.5. Visual Field Testing (Perimetry)
Visual fields will be assessed in both eyes at the times indicated in Table 3, Section 16.1 only 
at sites where the required perimetry equipment, as specified in the Study Operations Manual, 
is available. Visual fields will be assessed in triplicate over a 2-day period at Visit 1 for all 
subjects. Visual field outputs will be sent to a CRC for review. Data will be generated and 
collated within the CRC and exported to the Sponsor or designee for inclusion in the study 
database. In Part II, visual fields should be assessed using the Octopus 900 perimeter.

5010.6. Contrast Sensitivity
Contrast sensitivity will be measured for both eyes at the times indicated in Table 3, Section 
16.1. For contrast sensitivity, assessors will be appropriately qualified for conducting the 
assessment.
In Part II, it is preferable that the same masked assessor who performs the contrast sensitivity 
assessments during the masked period from Month 3 through Month 12 also perform these 
assessments at screening. 
10.7. Low Luminance Visual Acuity
Low luminance visual acuity will be measured for both eyes at the times indicated in Table 3, 
Section 16.1. The test should be performed before BCVA testing and pupil dilation. LLVA is 
measured by placing a 2.0-log-unit neutral density filter over the front of each eye and having 
the subject read the normally illuminated ETDRS chart. Initially, letters are read at a distance 
of 4 meters from the chart. If <20 letters are read at 4 meters, testing at 1 meter should be 
performed. LLVA is to be reported as number of letters read correctly by the subject.
In Part II, it is preferable that the same masked assessor who performs the LLVA assessments 
during the masked period from Month 3 through Month 12 also perform these assessments at 
screening.

5111. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
All efforts should be made to conduct the safety assessments; if a subject is not able to 
perform an assessment due to poor VA, it will be documented accordingly in the eCRF and 
will not be recorded as a protocol deviation.
11.1. Dose Limiting Toxicity
See Section 6.1.1 for definitions of DLTs; See Section 11.2.4 for instruction on reporting 
DLTs.
11.2. Evaluation, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events
11.2.1. Definitions
11.2.1.1. Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug/surgical procedure. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug/surgical procedure, 
whether or not related to the investigational product or with the surgical procedure described 
in this protocol.
AEs are to also include any pre-existing condition (other than XLRP) or illness that worsens 
during the study (i.e., increases in frequency or intensity).
11.2.1.2. Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Results in vision loss or is vision threatening
Is another important medical event(s).
The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which the 
subject is at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.
Hospitalisation that was pre-scheduled or for an elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment for a pre-existing condition, which has not worsened, does not constitute an SAE.
Other events that may not result in death, are not life threatening or do not require 
hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above.

CONFIDENTIAL
52Vision Loss to Be Reported as a Serious Adverse Event
Vision Loss NOT TO BE Reported as an SAE:
Surgery-related BCVA decrease of ≥15 letters on ETDRS chart occurring 
within1 day of surgery but recovering / resolving at post-operative Day 7. 
Vision Loss or Vision-Threatening Event TO BE Reported as an SAE:
Surgery-related BCVA decrease of ≥15 letters on ETDRS chart that occurs within 
1 day of surgery and that has not recovered* by the 1-Month Visit.
A decrease in BCVA of ≥15 letters on ETDRS chart that occurs within 1 day of 
surgery, however, in the investigator’s opinion:
oHas an evolution not consistent with the expected post-operative course; 
oMay be attributable to a complication that occurred during surgery, or another 
untoward event, or the study drug; 
oActually or potentially requires any surgical or medical intervention to prevent 
permanent loss of vision.
Non-surgery-related, sustained (>48 hours duration) decrease from baseline in 
BCVA of ≥15 letters on ETDRS chart.
*Recovery / Resolution of BCVA loss is defined as a return to within 10 letters of the 
baseline BCVA on the ETDRS chart.
11.2.2. Recording of Adverse Events
AEs/SAEs will be collected from the time the subject or parent / legal guardian (where 
applicable) provides written informed consent through Visit 11 (or ET Visit or Unscheduled 
Visits, if applicable).
AEs/SAEs that the investigator becomes aware of, and which are deemed to have a 
relationship to the study drug, should continue to be reported to NightstaRx following the 
completion of the study for a period of up to 5 years following surgery, until/unless the 
subject is enrolled in another NightstaRx study. 
Subjects will be questioned on the occurrence of an AE at every visit including any 
unscheduled visit, by using non-leading questioning such as ‘How have you been since the 
last visit?’
All AEs occurring during the study observed by the investigator or reported by the subject, 
whether attributed to study drug or the surgical procedure, will be recorded in the subject’s 
medical records and in the eCRF. Any clinically significant changes in laboratory results or 
vital sign measurements (as determined by the investigator) are to be recorded as an AE.
The following information will be recorded in the eCRF for each AE: description, date of 
onset and end date, outcome, severity, assessment of relatedness to study drug/study 
procedure, the action taken and confirmation of whether the event is considered serious (see 
Section 11.2.1.2 for the definition of seriousness). Follow-up information should be provided 
as necessary (see Section 11.2.3 for specifics on follow-up procedures).
AE severity and relationship to the study drug or the surgical procedure will be assessed at 
the site by the investigator or a medically qualified designee.
AAV8-RPGR
Protocol: NSR-RPGR-01Version 11.0

CONFIDENTIAL
53AE Severity
The severity of events will be assessed on the following scale:
1.  = mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
2.  = moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)
3.  = severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities).
AE Relationship
When assigning relatedness of the AE, consideration will be given to whether there is a 
plausible relationship to either the study drug or the surgical procedure. The following are 
definitions of relatedness that will be used in this study:
Unrelated: is not reasonably related in time to the administration of the 
study drug/surgical procedure, or exposure of the study 
drug/surgical procedure has not yet occurred, or biologic 
plausibility does not exist
Related: A reasonable possibility exists that the study drug / study 
procedure caused the AE. A suspected AE can be further 
defined by:
Possibly related: clinically or biologically reasonable relative 
to the administration of the study drug/surgical procedure, but 
the event could have been due to another equally likely cause
Probably related: is clinically/biologically reasonable relative 
to the administration of the study drug/surgical procedure, and 
the event is more likely explained by exposure 
to/administration of the study drug/surgical procedure than by 
other factors and causes
Definitely related: There is a causal relationship of the onset of 
the event, relative to administration of the study drug/surgical 
procedure and there is no other cause to explain the event.
When a relationship is determined to exist, the investigator or medical designee will further 
define if that relationship is to the study drug, the surgical procedure, both, or unknown .
11.2.3. Follow-up of Adverse Events
AEs will be followed until the subject has recovered or the subject’s participation in the study 
is complete.
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study as a result of a drug-related AE will be followed 
up until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilized or the subject or parent / legal guardian 
(where applicable) withdraws consent or is lost to follow-up.
All SAEs, regardless of attribution to study drug or the surgical procedure, should be 
followed-up until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilized or the subject or parent / legal 
guardian (where applicable) withdraws consent or is lost to follow-up. The Sponsor (or 
designee) will follow up on SAE reports to completion. Investigators are expected to provide 
the requested additional information for a complete assessment and documentation of the 
SAE reports in a timely manner.

CONFIDENTIAL
5411.2.4. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Dose-Limiting Toxicities
The investigator shall immediately (within 24 hours of learning of the event) report any SAE 
(and/or DLT) to the Sponsor (or its designee) by completing and emailing the DLT/SAE 
form. For reporting purposes, the date of SAE form submission by the investigator to the 
Sponsor will be designated as Day 0. The initial report shall be promptly followed up with a 
more detailed report providing specifics about the subject and the event. Copies of hospital 
reports, autopsy reports and other documents should be provided (if applicable).
The sponsor may unmask any SAE reports that are serious, unexpected, and related to the 
study drug, as required, in accordance with safety reporting guidance and regulations.
The sponsor will report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) to 
investigative sites, Institutional Review Boards/Independent Ethics Committees (IRBs/IECs) 
and regulatory authorities in compliance with current legislation. All cases that are fatal or 
life-threatening will be reported immediately after the sponsor receives the initial report from 
the Investigator. All non-fatal or non-life-threatening cases will be reported within a 
maximum of fifteen days after the initial Investigators report. The sponsor will also provide 
periodic safety reports to IRBs/IECs and regulatory authorities as applicable. Follow-up SAE 
reports will be submitted within 15 days of receiving the information.
A sample DLT/SAE form is provided in the Study Operations Manual, along with the SAE 
reporting contact information.
11.2.5. Procedures for Unmasking 
The Investigator has the ability to unmask an individual subject’s treatment assignment to 
provide emergency treatment. Unmasking is appropriate when knowledge of the subject’s 
dose would affect the medical management of the subject. 
If the Investigator determines the unmasking is required, then s/he unmasks the subject 
through the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system, files the resulting confirmation in a 
restricted file until the end of the study, and notifies the Medical Monitor within 24 hours that 
the subject’s treatment assignment has been unmasked. The Investigator will not 
communicate the treatment assignment to the Medical Monitor or to any sponsor or study 
team staff; nor should the treatment assignment be communicated to site staff other than 
those personnel who require that knowledge in order to treat the subject.
The Investigator will ensure that the rationale, date, and time of unmasking is noted in the 
subject’s source documentation, but not the treatment assignment. The medical emergency 
that necessitated unmasking must also be recorded in the source documentation and the case 
report form per standard study procedures.
11.2.6. Data Monitoring Committee
For Part I, an independent DMC will be used in this study to safeguard the safety and 
interests of study subjects and assess the safety and benefit/risk of the gene therapy 
intervention during the trial. At regular intervals during the study, the DMC will review the 
progress and accrued study data and provide advice to the Sponsor on the safety aspects of 
the study, including recommendations for dose escalation (see Section 6.3 ). The DMC will 
inform the Sponsor if there is a consensus that the ongoing data show that the gene therapy, 
its method of administration, and/or the study design are no longer in the best interests of 
study subjects.

55In Part II, DMC will be held to review safety and assess benefit/risk during the course of the 
study.
If one IA is performed, the study will continue as planned in a masked fashion. 
11.3. Pregnancy
Any pregnancy that occurs during the clinical study in a female partner of a study subject 
should be recorded on a Pregnancy Notification Form. Consent from the pregnant partner is 
required prior to the collection of personal data. However, the investigator shall immediately 
(within 24 hours of learning of the event) report the pregnancy, with at least preliminary data, 
to the Sponsor (or its designee) by completing and emailing a Pregnancy Notification Form. 
In addition, if possible, outcome of the pregnancy fathered by the subject should be recorded, 
including any congenital abnormality or birth defects.
11.4. Full Ophthalmic Examination
A full ophthalmic examination will be conducted for both eyes at the times indicated in Table 
3, Section 16.1. The ophthalmic examination will include indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit lamp 
examination, IOP, anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation grading and LOCS III cataract 
grading. The same slit lamp machine and lighting conditions should be used across study 
visits for any given subject.
Subjects who develop cataracts may undergo cataract surgery if deemed clinically necessary; 
if surgery is performed, it should be carried out at least 4 weeks before the Visit 9 (Month 12) 
or Visit 11 (Month 24).
11.5. Fundus Photography
To aid in the objective clinical assessment of progressive retinal changes in the periphery of 
the retina, fundus photography will be performed for both eyes at the times indicated in Table 
3, Section 16.1. Fundus photography will be performed by certified technicians following 
pupil dilation. All fundus photographs will be sent by the sites to the CRC for review; the 
CRC will enter the data into the EDC system. For complete technical specifications for 
fundus photography, refer to the Study Operations Manual (which will include procedures 
from the CRC regarding how measurements are to be taken).
11.6. Vital Signs
Vital signs (pulse and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) will be taken at the times 
indicated in Table 3, Section 16.1. Vital signs should be taken after the subject is seated for at 
least 5 minutes.
11.7. Laboratory Assessments
11.7.1. Laboratory Safety Parameters
Blood samples will be collected at the times indicated in Table 3, Section 16.1 for 
measurement of hematology and clinical chemistry parameters. Samples will be sent to a 
central laboratory for analysis. Refer to the Study Operations Manual for details on the 
shipping and handling of samples.

5712. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
For full details of the statistical analyses, please refer to the XIRIUS Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP). 
12.1. Sample Size
Due to the nature of the study design of Part I, no formal sample size computation was 
performed. 
In Part II, the primary endpoint is the proportion of study eyes with ≥7 dB improvement from 
baseline at ≥5 of the 16 central loci of the 10-2 grid assessed by MAIA microperimetry at 
12 months. A sample size of 10 subjects from a treatment group (either high dose or low 
dose), and 9 subjects from the untreated control group, will provide approximately 
87% power, assuming the treatment group has a 50% response rate and the untreated group 
has a 5% response rate. The power calculation is based on Fisher Exact-Boschloo test with a 
Berger-Boos correction of beta = 0.001, at a right-sided significance level of 0.10. 
12.2. Procedure for Accounting for Missing Data
All reasonable efforts will be made to obtain complete data for both eyes on all subjects. 
However, missing observations may occur. Management of dropouts and missing 
observations will depend on their nature and frequency.
Part I is an open-label study. For efficacy endpoints, observations collected within 6 months 
of the last visit window will be included in the primary analysis. Efficacy endpoints will be 
summarized on observed data and no imputation will be performed. Safety endpoints will 
also be analysed on observed data and no imputation will be performed.
Part II is a randomized and double-masked study. For efficacy endpoints, observations 
collected within 6 months of the last visit window will be included in the primary analysis. 
Additional imputation approaches will be specified in the SAP. Safety endpoints will be 
analysed on observed data and no imputation will be performed.
12.3. Analysis Sets
12.3.1. Safety Analysis Set
For Part I, the Safety Analysis Set will consist of all subjects who receive study treatment 
(vitrectomy/AAV8-RPGR). The Safety Analysis Set will be used for all analyses in Part I. 
For Part II, the Safety Analysis Set will consist of all subjects who are randomised under both 
the 2- and the 3-arm randomisation schedules and receive study treatment when randomized 
to active treatment, or attend Visit 2 (telephone call) when randomized to control (no 
treatment). Safety summaries of Part II will use the Safety Analysis Set and subjects will be 
analysed based on the actual treatment received. 
12.3.2. Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set
The intent-to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set will consist of all Part II subjects who are randomised, 
under the 3-arm randomisation schedule. The efficacy summaries of Part II will be generated 
using the ITT Analysis Set. Subjects will be analysed based on the treatment to which they 
were randomised.

5812.4. Descriptive Statistics
Summary statistics will be presented for both eyes (Study Eyes versus Fellow Eyes). No 
formal statistical comparison will be performed in Part I. Formal statistical testing will be 
conducted for the primary endpoint in Part II. Continuous variables and their change from 
baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects [n], mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, first and third quartiles, fifth and ninety-
fifth percentiles). The CIs of the mean and the mean change from baseline at each visit may 
be provided where applicable. For categorical variables, the number and proportion of 
subjects pertaining to each category will be presented over time. The CIs of the proportion 
may be provided where applicable.
12.5. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographics and baseline ocular characteristics will be summarised by Safety Analysis Set 
in both Part I and Part II 
12.6. Efficacy Analyses
Efficacy assessments are ocular in nature and therefore will be tabulated by eye (Study Eye 
and Fellow Eye). In Part I, efficacy endpoints will be summarised on observed data using 
descriptive statistics only (described in Section 12.4). In Part II, efficacy endpoints will be 
summarized on observed data using descriptive statistics. Additional analyses for handling 
missing data will be provided for the primary endpoint and selected secondary endpoint.  
For each subject, data collected within 6 months of the last visit window will be included in 
the primary analysis, as described in greater detail in the SAP. 
At final analysis in Part II, the primary endpoint, which is defined as the proportion of study 
eyes with ≥7 dB improvement from baseline at ≥5 of the 16 central loci at 12 months, will be 
compared between treatment groups (high dose vs untreated; low dose vs untreated) using the 
Fisher Exact-Boschloo test with a Berger-Boos correction of beta=0.001 (Berger and Boos 
1994). The CIs for the difference in proportions between treatment groups will be presented 
by Miettinen and Nurminen (Miettinen and Nurminen 1985) method. 
For the continuous variables of mean sensitivity, BCVA, and LLVA in Part II, the primary 
analysis to handle missing data uses a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) model. The 
mean change from baseline will be analyzed using fixed effects of treatment group, study 
visit, study-visit-treatment interaction, and baseline value. 
12.6.1. Multiplicity Adjustment
Part I is the dose-escalation to identify the MTD based on the evaluation of benefit/risk 
without any formal statistical comparisons, and therefore no multiplicity adjustment is 
needed. 
In Part II, a single administrative IA may be included to facilitate the planning of Phase 3 
activities. As no early stopping for efficacy is allowed, no multiplicity adjustment is required 
for this administrative IA. At final analysis, the primary endpoint will be tested using 
Hochberg’s (Hochberg 1988) step-up method with familywise error rate controlled at one-
side 0.10. The study wil
l be declared positive if either dose or both doses achieve statistical 
significance.

5912.7. Safety Analyses
Due to the potential systemic effect of study treatment (surgery/study drug) on the 
contralateral eye, ocular assessments and AEs will be summarised by eye (Study Eye and 
Fellow Eye) while systemic assessments will be analysed at the subject level. No formal 
statistical testing will be performed for safety analyses. Safety analyses will be performed on 
the Safety Analysis Set.
12.7.1. Adverse Events
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. The version of the 
dictionary current at the time of the database lock will be used.
AEs will be summarised by system organ class and preferred term. Both the number of 
eyes/subjects experiencing an AE and the number of events will be summarized. The SAEs, 
severity, and relationship to study drug/procedure will be also summarized. A by-subject listing of 
SAEs and DLTs (Part I only) will be provided. 
12.7.2. Ocular Safety Evaluations
IOP and changes from baseline in IOP, abnormal slit lamp examination findings and indirect 
ophthalmoscopy findings, and anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation grading will be 
summarised by visit and eye.
Lens opacity categories and shifts from baseline will be summarised by visit and eye.
Categories of fundus photography findings (none/mild/moderate/severe) will be summarised 
by visit and eye.
The number of subjects with a 5, 10 and 15letter decrease from baseline in BCVA will be 
tabulated by visit and by eye.
12.7.3. Laboratory Assessments and Vital Signs
Laboratory assessments and vital signs will be summarised in a descriptive manner 
(described in Section 12.4).
12.8. Interim Analysis 
 
In Part II, a single administrative IA may be performed. If this IA is performed, the study will 
continue as planned in a masked fashion.

REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS
13.1. Informed Consent
Subjects with XLRP who meet all the entry criteria and might be expected to benefit from 
gene therapy will be invited to take part in the study. Subjects or parent / legal guardian 
(where applicable) must personally sign and date the latest IEC/ IRB approved version of the 
informed consent form before any study-specific procedures are performed. Where 
applicable, a subject assent form will be obtained.
Written and verbal versions of the subject information and informed consent will be 
presented to the subject or parent / legal guardian (where applicable) detailing no less than: 
the exact nature of the study; the implications and constraints of the protocol; and the known 
side effects and any risks involved in taking part. It will be clearly stated that the subject is 
free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without prejudice to future care, 
and with no obligation to give the reason for withdrawal.
The subject or parent /legal guardian (where applicable) will be allowed as much time as 
needed to consider the information and the opportunity to question the investigator, their 
primary care physician/general practitioner or other independent parties to decide whether 
they will participate in the study. Written informed consent will then be obtained by means of 
subject or parent / legal guardian (where applicable) dated signature and dated signature of 
the person who presented and obtained the informed consent. Where applicable, a subject 
assent form will be obtained. The person who obtained the consent/assent must be suitably 
qualified and experienced and have been authorized to do so by the investigator. A copy of 
the signed informed consent will be given to each subject or parent / legal guardian. The 
original signed form will be retained at the study site and an additional copy will remain in 
the subject’s medical records.
Each subject will have 1 eye treated. Selection of the “study eye” will be made on clinical 
grounds and will generally be the worse eye affected. This will be discussed in detail and 
agreed with each subject as part of the informed consent process.
This is an assessor-masked study. All subjects will be informed at the time of randomisation 
whether they have been randomised to the AAV8-RPGR or Control group. However, subjects 
in the AAV8-RPGR treatment groups will be masked to the assigned dose level.
In the case of a female partner pregnancy fathered by a subject, a partner pregnancy informed 
consent form must be signed and dated before collecting information regarding the outcome 
of the pregnancy (birth or spontaneous abortion), as well as any incidents of congenital 
abnormality, birth defect or other medical problems. 
13.2. Ethical/Regulatory Review
The protocol, informed consent/assent form, subject information sheet and any proposed 
advertising material will be submitted, in accordance with local requirements, to an 
appropriate Research Ethics Committee (IEC or IRB), regulatory authorities and host 
institution(s) for written approval. If there are any changes to the approved protocol (with the 
exception of emergency modifications required for the subject’s safety), a protocol 
amendment will be issued by the Sponsor. When required by local law, the IEC/IRB and 
Competent Authority must give written approval of any amendments likely to affect the

14.1. Data Quality Control and Assurance
The study will be conducted in accordance with the current approved protocol, ICH GCP, 
relevant regulations, and standard operating procedures (SOPs).
The Sponsor and its selected vendors have systems in place for implementing and 
maintaining quality assurance and quality control systems, with written SOPs to ensure that 
all aspects of the trial will be conducted in compliance with this protocol and data will be 
generated, documented and reported in compliance with this protocol.
Data will be entered into a validated clinical study database and subject to programmed 
validation checks and manually verified for accuracy and completeness by a Sponsor’s 
representative, both remotely and during on-site monitoring visits. Any discrepancies will be 
resolved with the investigator or designee, as appropriate.
Regular monitoring will be performed by the Sponsor or its designee according to ICH GCP. 
Data will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol and accuracy in relation to source 
documents. Following written SOPs, the monitors will verify that the study is conducted, and 
data are generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and 
applicable regulatory requirements.
In addition, this study will be subject to quality assurance audits to independently verify 
compliance with the protocol.
14.2. Data Handling and Records Management
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate source documents, which will be the 
basis of information for the eCRFs. The source documents are to be separate and distinct 
from the eCRFs. All study data will be entered on an encrypted EDC system with individual 
pass-codes known to each investigator and appropriately delegated study team members. This 
electronic data entry system has been validated. Incomplete or inconsistent data will result in 
data queries that require resolution by the investigator or designee.
The investigator must ensure that clinical study records are retained according to national 
regulations. The investigator must immediately inform the Sponsor if any documents are to 
be destroyed, transferred to another facility, or transferred to a different owner.
In addition, files containing photos or digital outputs will be electronically transmitted to the 
reading center for centralized, standardised review. Data from these reading centers will

identified by a subject ID number on the eCRF and any electronic database. The subject’s 
name and any other identifying detail will NOT be included in any study data electronic file. 
The study will comply with the data protection laws which require data to be anonymized as 
soon as it is practical to do so.
Subject medical information obtained in this study is confidential, and disclosure to third 
parties other than those noted below is prohibited. As required by Personal Information 
Protection and Electronics Documents Act and Personal Health Information Protection Act, 
upon the subject’s permission, medical information may be given to his or her personal 
physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for his or her welfare. Data 
generated by this study must be available for inspection by regulatory agencies, national and 
local health authorities, the Sponsor or their representative, and the IEC/IRB.
14.4. End of the Study
Part I includes 24 months of follow-up for each subject enrolled and treated. Part II includes 
12 months of follow-up for each subject enrolled and treated.
The end of the study is defined as the date the last subject completes his final-visit 
assessments, or early termination [ET] assessments in the event of premature discontinuation, 
or the date of last data collection if the last subject is lost to follow-up.
14.5. Policy for Publication and Presentation of Data

a. The Screening/Baseline Visit must be performed within 12 weeks of Visit 2 
b. Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if a subject in Part II is unable to attend the 12-month visit during the protocol-defined 
window, they should return to the site to complete this visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so. Delays will be identified as PDs on a case-by-case 
basis by the Sponsor based on information provided by the site; this will include but is not limited to scenarios such as site closure, travel bans, medical 
travel prohibitions, patient illness, etc.
c. Visits 10 and 11 are for Part I subjects only

72d. Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if a subject in Part I is unable to attend the 24-month visit during the protocol-defined 
window, they should return to the site to complete this visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so. Delays will be identified as PDs on a case-by-case 
basis by the Sponsor based on information provided by the site; this will include but is not limited to scenarios such as site closure, travel bans, medical 
travel prohibitions, patient illness, etc.
e. An early termination (ET) visit is to be performed if a subject discontinues at any time.  
f. If clinically indicated, subjects may need to return to the site for an unscheduled visit. At a minimum, the following assessments will be performed: full 
ophthalmic examination, BCVA, SD-OCT, microperimetry (if clinically feasible), fundus autofluorescence, AE/SAE monitoring, and concomitant 
medication, treatments, and procedures review
g. Visits 2, 3, and 4 will be a telephone call only for subjects randomised to the control, untreated group. AE/SAE monitoring and concomitant medication, 
treatments, and procedures review will be assessed during the call. 
h. Includes hematology and clinical chemistry
i. To be conducted only if unavailable at Visit 1 
j. Includes indirect ophthalmoscopy, slit lamp examination, IOP, anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation grading and LOCS III cataract grading
k. Study eye only
l. Part I subjects will take 1 mg/kg/day prednisone/prednisolone for a total of 10 days (beginning 2 days before the vector injection, on the day of 
injection, and then for 7 days); followed by 0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days; 0.25 mg/kg/day for 2 days; and 0.125 mg/kg/day for 2 days (21 days in total). Part 
II subjects in treated groups will be given a 9-week course of oral prednisone/prednisolone and instructed to start taking the drug 3 days before Visit 2. 
See Section 8.8. 
m. Part I subjects perform BCVA assessments in triplicate at baseline, Month 12, Month 24, and at the Early Termination visit, when applicable. For Part II 
subjects only: if the BCVA value at Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline) is ≥ ± 10 letter gain or loss in the study eye compared to the previous XOLARIS study 
visit (if applicable), then BCVA must be repeated an additional 2 times, resulting in a total of 3 BCVA measures at Visit 1. 
In Part II subjects, if the BCVA value at Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline) is < ± 10 letter difference in the study eye compared to the previous XOLARIS 
study visit, then BCVA will be collected once and will not be repeated. If subject was not previously in XOLARIS study, BCVA assessments at baseline 
must be triplicate.
For all subjects who require triplicate BCVA testing, to facilitate the additional BCVA measures, this visit should be conducted over 2 days, with 
BCVA measured twice on Day 1 and once on Day 2 (prior to pupil dilation). All 3 BCVA values must be recorded in the eCRF. At screening, the 
highest score will be used to define subject eligibility.
n. Subjects perform triplicate microperimetry only at baseline. The final microperimetry assessment will be used to determine eligibility. Microperimetry 
should be conducted at unscheduled visits, if clinically feasible. Microperimetry outputs will be sent to a CRC for review. Data will be generated and 
collated within the CRC and exported to the Sponsor or designee for inclusion in the study database.
o. Triplicate at baseline. Octopus 900 perimeter is specified for visual field assessments only in Part II. Visual field outputs will be sent to a CRC for 
review. Data will be generated and collated within the CRC and exported to the Sponsor or designee for inclusion in the study database.
q. Blood, tears (both eyes), saliva, and urine samples will be collected for the viral shedding assay.
r. Immunogenicity sampling at the ET Visit is to be conducted only if visit occurs prior to Month 12 visit.
s. AEs/SAEs will be collected from the time the subject provides written informed consent/assent through to the last study visit (or ET Visit if applicable). 
t. Corticosteroid review is applicable only for treated subjects. 
u. Part II only.

Biogen MA Inc.
2PRIMARY REASON FOR AMENDMENT
Two primary reasons for this amendment to Protocol 274RP101 (NSR-RPGR-01) are 1) to 
reduce the sample size and 2) remove the requirement for an interim analysis (IA). 
Regarding the first primary reason, the sections most affected by these changes are Section 13.1 
(Sample Size), and secondarily Sections 7.1 (Overall Study Design), Section 7.1.4 (Part II Dose 
Expansion), Section 7.2, (Number of Subjects).  This change in sample size required additional 
modifications to the planned Statistical Analyses. The sections most affected by the statistical 
analysis changes are Section 13.2 (Procedure for Accounting for Missing Data), Section 13.3.1 
(Safety Analysis Set), Section 13.3.2 (Intent to Treat Analysis Set), Section 13.4 (Descriptive 
Statistics), Section 13.5 (Demographics and Baseline Characteristics), Section 13.6 (Efficacy 
Analysis), Section 13.6.1 (Multiplicity Adjustment), Section 13.7.1 (Adverse Events), and 
Section 13.7.2 (Ocular Safety).
Regarding the second primary reason, the sections most affected by these changes are Section 
13.8 (Interim Analysis), and secondarily, Sections 7.1.4 (Part II, Dose-Expansion), Section 
12.2.6 (Data Monitoring Committee).

31. PRIMARY REASON ONE
Section 13.1, Sample Size
In Part II, a sample size of 45 subjects, 15 in each of 3 groups (high-dose, low-dose and 
untreated), ensures 80% power at 0.05 significance level assuming that the treated arm has 50% 
probability of achieving ≥7 dB improvement at ≥5 loci at Month 3 vs. 5% in the untreated 
control arm. In Part II, the primary endpoint is the proportion of study eyes with ≥7 dB 
improvement from baseline at ≥5 of the 16 central loci of the 10-2 grid assessed by MAIA 
microperimetry at 12 months. A sample size of 10 subjects from a treatment group (either 
high dose or low dose), and 9 subjects from the untreated control group, will provide 
approximately 87% power, assuming the treatment group has a 50% respon se rate and the 
untreated group has a 5% response rate. The power calculation is based on Fisher Exact-
Boschloo test with a Berger-Boos correction of beta = 0.001, at a right-sided significance 
level of 0.10.
Rationale for reduction in sample size: 
Study drug expired end of September 2019, and it was not possible to extend the shelf-life, nor 
was there the possibility of using a new drug supply without causing a significant delay to the 
completion of this study.
The team performed an assessment and determined to close enrollment as of the last subject 
enrolled on 30 September 2019.  It was decided that 29 subjects will provide sufficient data to 
inform the next pivotal study.  
This change also affects text in Section 7.1 (Overall Study Design), 7.1.4 (Part II, Dose 
Expansion), and 7.2 (Number of Subjects).  This sample size change also triggered broad 
changes to the planned statistical analyses, affecting Section 13.2 (Procedures for Accounting for 
Missing Data), Section 13.3.1 (Safety Analysis Set), Section 13.3.2 (Intent to Treat Analysis 
Set), Section 13.4 (Descriptive Statistics), Section 13.5 (Demographics and Baseline 
Characteristics), and Section 13.6 (Efficacy Analysis).

4Section 7.1, Overall Study Design
Now reads:
Part II will expand 2 doses, allowing for a broader assessment of the safety and efficacy of 
AAV8-RPGR with a larger sample size, including 45 approximately 30 subjects randomized 
1:1:1 to a high-dose, a low-dose, or an untreated arm.
Section 7.1.4, Part II, Dose expansion
Now reads:
Up to 45 From version 9.0 thereafter, approximately 30 additional subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio to a high-dose group (2.5 × 10^11 gp), a low-dose group (5 
× 10^10 gp), and an untreated group.
Section 7.2, Number of Subjects
Now reads:
Overall, the study is expected to enroll approximately 63 48 subjects: 18 in Part I and up to 
approximately 45 30 in Part II under 1:1:1 randomization scheme.  See Section 13.1 for 
rationale.  
Section 13.2 Procedures for Accounting for Missing Data
Now reads:
Safety and efficacy data will be analysed on observed data only. Missing data will not be 
imputed.
Part I is an open-label study. For efficacy endpoints, observations collected within 6 
months of the last visit window will be included in the primary analysis. and. Efficacy 
endpoints will be summarized on observed data and no imputation will be performed. 
Safety endpoints will be analysed on observed data and no imputation will be performed.
Part II is a randomized and double-masked study. For efficacy endpoints, observations 
collected within 6 months of the last visit window will be included in the primary analysis. 
Additional imputation approaches will be specified in the SAP. Safety endpoints will be 
analysed on observed data and no imputation will be performed.

5Section 13.3.1, Safety Analysis Set
Now reads:
The Safety Analysis Set will be the primary population for demographics, baseline 
characteristics and safety analyses used for all analyses in Part I.
For Part II, the Safety Analysis Set will consist of all subjects who are randomised , under both 
the 2- and the 3-arm randomisation schedules and receive study treatment when randomized 
to active treatment, or attend Visit 2 (telephone call) when randomized to control (no 
treatment).  Safety summaries of Part II will use the Safety Analysis Set and subjects will 
be analysed based on the actual treatment received. The Safety Analysis Set will be the 
primary population for demographics, baseline characteristics and safety analyses. Subjects will 
be analysed based on the actual treatment received.
Section 13.3.2 Intent to Treat Analysis Set
Now reads:
The intent-to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set will consist of all Part II subjects who are randomised, 
under the 3-arm randomisation schedules.  The ITT Analysis Set will be used for the efficacy 
analyses. The efficacy summaries of Part II will be generated using the ITT Analysis Set. 
Subjects will be analysed based on the treatment to which they were randomised. 
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) Analysis Set will include all Part II subjects who are 
randomised under the 3-arm randomisation schedule and who receive study treatment (or the 
phone call for those in the untreated control group) and who have baseline microperimetry data 
and at least 1 post-baseline microperimetry data in the study eye. The mITT Analysis Set will be 
used for supportive and sensitivity analysis for Part II primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Subjects will be analysed based on the treatment to which they were randomised.
Section 13.4 Descriptive Statistics
Now reads:
Summary statistics will be presented for both eyes (Study Eyes versus Fellow Eyes).  No formal 
statistical comparison will be performed in Part I, and statistical tests will be conducted for the 
efficacy endpoints in Part II.  For categorical/binary data, the number and proportion of subjects 
pertaining to each category will be presented over time with its 95% confidence interval (CI). 
Continuous data will be summarised over time using mean, and its 95% CI, standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum. 95% CIs will be 2-sided. Summaries will be generated by dose 
and overall, in Part I and, by group (high-dose, low-dose, untreated) in Part II. Formal statistical 
testing will be conducted for the primary endpoint in Part II. Continuous variables and 
their change from baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of

6subjects [n], mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, first and third 
quartiles, fifth and ninety-fifth percentiles). The confidence interval (CI) is of the mean and 
the mean change from baseline at each visit may be provided where applicable. For 
categorical variables, the number and proportion of subjects pertaining to each category 
will be presented over time. The CIs of the proportion may be provided where applicable. 
will be computed using the Clopper-Pearson method.
Section 13.5, Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Now reads:
Demographics and baseline ocular characteristics will be summarised by using for the Safety 
Analysis Set in both Part I and Part II. and the full analysis set for Part I and Part II separately.
Section 13.6 Efficacy Analysis
Now reads:
Efficacy assessments are ocular in nature and therefore will be tabulated by eye (Study Eye and 
Fellow Eye). In Part I, efficacy data e ndpoints will be summarised on observed data using 
descriptive statistics only (described in Section 13.4). In Part II, efficacy endpoints will be 
summarized on observed data using descriptive statistics. Additional analyses for handling 
missing data will be provided for the primary endpoint and selected secondary endpoint. 
This will be done for each cohort in Part I, and each arm group in Part II.
For each subject, data collected within 6 months of the last visit window will be included in 
the primary analysis, as described in greater detail in the SAP. 
Improvement in retinal sensitivity and change from baseline in retinal sensitivity will be 
tabulated by visit and by eye in each Part, and be compared between the randomized groups in 
Part II by visit for the study eye.
At final analysis in Part II, the primary endpoint, which is defined as th e proportion of 
study eyes with  with improved retinal sensitivity, for both the center grid (i.e., the central 16 
loci) and the entire grid (i.e., all 68 loci), ≥7 dB improvement from baseline at ≥5 of the 16 
central loci at 12 months, will be compared between study arms treatment groups (high dose vs 
untreated; low dose vs untreated) using the Fisher Exact-Boschloo test with a Berger-Boos 
correction of beta=0.001 (Berger 1994).  In addition, the difference in proportions between study 
arms will be presented with its corresponding 95% CI calculatedThe CIs for the difference in 
proportions between treatment groups will be presented by Miettinen and Nurminen (Miettinen 
1985) method. 
For the continuous variables of mean sensitivity, BCVA, and LLVA in Part II, the primary 
analysis to handle missing data uses a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) model.

7The mean change from baseline will be analyzed using fixed effects of treatment group, 
study visit, study-visit-treatment interaction, and baseline value.  
Change from baseline in mean sensitivity, in both the center grid and the entire grid, will be 
compared between study arms using an ANCOVA model including baseline value and study arm 
(high dose, low-dose, and untreated) as covariates. The difference in means between study arms, 
and its 95% CI, will be derived from the same ANCOVA model.
Section 13.7.1, Adverse Events
Now reads:
The SAEs, severity, and relationship to study drug/procedure will be also summarized. A 
by-subject listing of SAEs and DLTs (Part I only) will be provided. Similar summaries will 
be produced for study drug/procedure-related AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and SAEs.  
AEs will also be summarised by maximum severity, relationship to study drug/procedure and 
time to onset.
For Part I only, A a by-subject listing of DLTs will be prepared.
Section 13.7.2 Ocular Safety Evaluation
Now reads: 
The number of subjects with a 5, 10- and 15-letter decrease from baseline in BCVA will be 
tabulated by visit and by eye.

82. PRIMARY REASON TWO
Section 13.8 Interim Analysis
Now reads:
  
In Part II, after all subjects complete the 3-month visit, a single  administrative IA will may be 
performed. by an independent DMC.  The DMC will review the accrued safety and efficacy data.  
A small group of unmasked Sponsor personnel, who will not be involved in the conduct of the 
study moving forward, will have access to unmasked data for this administrative IA to enable 
regulatory interactions and planning for phase 3 initiation.  The details of the roles and 
responsibilities of the Part II DMC are provided in the DMC charter, and the full details of 
masking are provided in the study Masking Plan. 
If this IA is performed, The the study will continue as planned in a masked fashion.  A final 
analysis will be conducted at the end of the study, i.e., after all subjects complete the study. The 
end of the study is defined as the date the last subject completes his final-visit assessments (or 
early termination [ET] assessments in the event of premature discontinuation) or the date of last 
data collection if the last subject is lost to follow-up.
Rationale: The interim analysis was determined to no  longer be necessary.
This change also affects Section 7.1.4, Part II: Dose Expansion
Now reads:
After all Part II subjects complete the 3-month visit During Part II, a single administrative IA 
will may be conducted. If this IA is performed, the study will continue as planned in a masked 
fashion.  
Section 9.6, Study Masking
Now reads:
After all During  Part II, subjects complete the 3-month visit, one administrative IA will may be  
performed. by an independent DMC, who will review the accrued safety and efficacy data.  A 
small group of unmasked Sponsor personnel, who will not be involved in the conduct of the 
study moving forward, will have access to unmasked data for this administrative IA to enable 
regulatory interactions and planning for phase 3 initiation. If this IA is performed, the study 
will continue as planned in a masked fashion. 
The operations team, the investigators, medical monitor, and other personnel who will continue 
to be involved in the daily operation of the study, as well as the subjects, will continue to be 
masked to the subjects’ dose level assignment and outcomes of the IA until study completion to

the treatment assignment. The full details of masking are provided in the study Masking Plan.
Section 12.2.6, Data Monitoring Committee
Now reads:
In Part II, DMC will be held to review safety and assess benefit/risk during the course of 
the study.
After allDuring Part II subjects complete the 3-month visit, an administrative IA will may be 
performed. If one IA is performed, the study will continue as planned in a mas ked fashion. 
by an independent DMC, who will review the accrued safety and efficacy data.  A small group of 
unmasked Sponsor personnel, who will not be involved in the conduct of the study moving 
forward, will have access to unmasked data for this administrative IA to enable regulatory 
interactions and planning for phase 3 initiation. Following the administrative IA, the DMC will 
continue to meet, as described in the DMC Charter.
Section 13.6.1, Multiplicity Adjustment
Now reads:
In Part II, a single administrative IA is may be included to facilitate the planning of Phase 3 
activities.
The final analysis will be conducted at 0.05 two-sided level for the primary endpoint. 
At final analysis, the primary endpoint will be tested using Hochberg’s (Hochberg 1988) 
step-up method with familywise error rate controlled at < 0.10 (one-sided).  The study will 
be declared positive if either dose or both doses achieve statistical significance.

10SUMMARY OF MAJOR CHANGES TO THE PROTOCOL
Changes to the protocol are presented chronologically. New text is shown in bold type; deleted 
text is shown with a strikethrough.
Synopsis
The synopsis was revised to reflect changes made throughout the protocol.
Section 5.4 
Change: Interim data were presented in the original protocol. This is now removed.
Now reads:
Interim (4-week) rResults from the sponsor’s toxicity study also indicate that administration of 
the same vector (AAV8 RPGR) is well tolerated in male C57BL/6J mice at dose levels of 
1×10^9 and 3.54×10^9 gp/eye; interim (35-day) results from the sponsor’s biodistribution study 
also support a lack of toxicity.
Rationale: The nonclinical toxicity studies are now complete. 
Section 6.2.1.2, Secondary and Exploratory Endpoints, Part I
Change: Removed Month 9 from the timepoints at which this endpoint will be assessed. 
Now reads:
• Change from baseline in fundus autofluorescence at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months
Rationale: One time point (month 9) was removed from the endpoint analysis regarding 
autofluorescence as it was added in error. This measure is not assessed at Month 9.

11Section 6.2.2.3 Secondary Endpoints 
Change: The secondary endpoints have been updated to separate the central 16-loci 
microperimetry mean change from baseline from the 68-loci microperimetry mean change from 
baseline. Previously, these 2 separate endpoints were not defined. Also, visual field-related 
endpoints at 1, 2 and 9 months were listed in error.  Visual field is not tested at these visits. 
Now reads: 
• Change from baseline in retinal sensitivity at the central 16 loci assessed by MAIA 
microperimetry at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
• Change from baseline in retinal sensitivity at 68 loci assessed by MAIA microperimetry at 1, 
2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
• Change from baseline in visual field assessed by Octopus 900 perimeter at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 
months
Rationale: Microperimetry is the most important efficacy endpoint in the study. More granularity 
was needed as multiple analyses will be conducted on this measure.
Section 6.2.2.4 Exploratory Endpoints
Change:  
Now reads:
• 
Rationale:  
 
Section 7.1 Overall Study Design
Change: additional time points were added for when microperimetry and safety and secondary 
efficacy assessments will be evaluated.
Now reads:
Baseline in microperimetry, evaluated at 3 12 months, and safety and secondary efficacy 
evaluated at 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months post-treatment.
Rationale: These time points were omitted in error.

12Section 7.1 Overall Study Design
Change: Text added regarding missed visits.
Now reads:
Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if Part I subjects are unable to 
attend their final 24-month visit during the protocol-defined window, they shou ld return to 
the site to complete this visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so. Delays will be 
identified as protocol deviations (PDs) on a case-by-case basis by the Sponsor based on 
information provided by the site; this will include but is not limited to scenarios such as site 
closure, travel bans, medical travel prohibitions, patient illness, etc.
A Part II subject is considered to have completed the study if he completes the Month 12 
assessments.  Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if Part II subjects are 
unable to attend their final 12-month visit during the protocol-defined window, they sh ould 
return to the site to complete this visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so. Delays will 
be identified as protocol deviations (PDs) on a case-by-case basis by the Sponsor based on 
information provided by the site; this will include but is not limited to scenarios such as site 
closure, travel bans, medical travel prohibitions, patient illness, etc.
Rationale: Instructions are provided in the case of missed final visits. If a subject misses the 12- 
or 24-month visit (for Parts I and II ), the site is instructed to bring the subject back to complete 
the 12- or 24-month visit assessments when it is possible to do so, even if this visit will be out-
of-window.
This change also affects Section 7.1.2, Part I, Dose Escalation Study, Section 7.1.4, Part II: 
Dose-Expansion, Section 10.10, Visit 9, Section 10.12, Visit 11.
Section 7.1.2, Part I, Dose Escalation Study
Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if Part I subjects are unable to 
attend their final 24-month visit during the protocol-defined window, they shou ld return to 
the site to complete this visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so.  This will be 
considered their 24-month visit. Delays will be identified as PDs on a case-by-case basis by 
the Sponsor based on information provided by the site; this will include but is not limited 
to scenarios such as site closure, travel bans, medical travel prohibitions, patient illness, etc.
Section 7.1.4, Part II Dose Expansion
Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if Part II subjects are unable to 
attend their final 12-month visit during the protocol-defined window, they shou ld return to 
the site to complete this visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so. This will be 
considered their 12-month visit. Delays will be identified as PDs on a case-by-case basis by

to scenarios such as site closure, travel bans, medical travel prohibitions, patient illness, etc.
Section 10.10, Visit 9
Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if Part II subjects are unable to 
attend their final 12-month visit during the protocol-defined window, they shou ld return to 
the site to complete this visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so. This will be 
considered their 12-month visit. Delays will be identified as PDs on a case-by-case basis by 
the Sponsor based on information provided by the site; this will include but is not limited 
to scenarios such as site closure, travel bans, medical travel prohibitions, patient illness, etc.
Section 10.12, Visit 11
Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if Part I subjects are unable to 
attend their final 24-month visit during the protocol-defined window, they shou ld return to 
the site to complete this visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so.  This will be 
considered their 24-month visit. Delays will be identified as PDs on a case-by-case basis by 
the Sponsor based on information provided by the site; this will include but is not limited 
to scenarios such as site closure, travel bans, medical travel prohibitions, patient illness, etc.

Now read:
b. Although the visit will still be considered out-of-window, if a subject in Part II is 
unable to attend the 12-month visit during the protocol-defined window, they should return 
to the site to complete this visit as soon as it is possible for them to do so. Delays will be 
identified as PDs on a case-by-case basis by the Sponsor based on information provided by 
the site; this will include but is not limited to scenarios such as site closure, travel bans,

Section 7.3 Discussion of Study Design and Dose Selection
Change: The NOAEL was changed from greater than to equal to 3.54 × 10^9.
Now reads:
The NOAEL was determined to be greater than 3.54 × 10^9 gp/eye in mice, providing a 700-fold 
safety margin compared to the starting dose.
Rationale: The NOAEL was incorrectly stated.
Section 9.6, Study Masking
Change: Removed masked assessors
In Part II, ophthalmic assessments that will be used as efficacy endpoints (BCVA, LLVA, 
microperimetry, contrast sensitivity ) will be conducted by appropriately qualified 
masked assessors
Rationale: Efficacy assessments are not masked throughout the study, only at certain timepoints.  
The table linked to this text specifies which timepoints and is therefore correct. However, it has 
been removed from this statement for accuracy. 
Section 15.4 Time and Schedule of the Study
Now reads:
Section 15.4 Time and Schedule End of the Study 
Rationale: This section did not provide a clear definition of end of study.
Added a second paragraph: 
The end of the study is defined as the date the last subject completes his final-visit 
assessments, or early termination [ET] assessments in the event of premature 
discontinuation, or the date of last data collection if the last subject is lost to follow-up.
Rationale: While this definition was also present in Section 7.1, it was not clearly defined here.

 RATIONALE FOR SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENT  
PROTOCOL AMENDMENT XIRIUS VERSION 9.0  
 
The most substantial change to the protocol is addition of a n administrative interim analysis (IA) 
after all Part II subjects complete 3 months of post- treatment follow -up. This act ivity will enable 
a data readout and Phase 3 planning / regulatory interactions as discussed in prior regulatory 
agency meetings .  Results of the interim analysis will then be presented to the regulatory 
agencies (both European Medicines Agency [E MA] and Food and Drug Administration [ FDA ]) 
for continued alignment on the acceptability of approach taken in evaluating the safety and efficacy of AAV8 -RPGR.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria have also been modified.  
• The requirement that subjects have a measurable ellipsoid zone (EZ) on optical coherence 
tomography (OCT) imaging has been removed to allow the broader study of X-linked 
retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) subjects who do not have a measurable EZ. 
• Documentation of a positive genetic screen now specifies that a pathogenic mutation 
must be present for clarification  of test results from genetic screening.  
• Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) now must achieve ≥34 letters in both eyes and not 
just the study eye to assure  that no monocular or subjects with very poor vision in the 
fellow eye are enrolled.  
• Exclusion has been added for subjects who are unsuitable candidates for surgery for any 
reason . 
Study masking language has been improved and the specific assessments that must be taken in a 
masked fashion are better described. Also, the maintenance of masking of study teams during the 
interim analysis proceedings are described.  
The assessment  has been removed 
from the s tudy due to lack of operational feasibility .  
Several changes to the Statistical Analysis and endpoints have been included:  
• After meetings with both the EMA and FDA, the primary endpoint, microperimetry, has 
been clarified as a categorical endp oint that identifie s the improvements in 
microperimetry at individual loci instead of overall mean retinal sensitivity. Therefore, 
the increase of ≥7 decibel (dB)  in ≥ 5 central loci has been selected as the microperimetry 
endpoint. This same level of change in all 68 loci has become a new secondary endpoint.  
In agreement with the EMA,  have 
been de-ranked to exploratory endpoints. 
• The safety analysis set has been clarified as including all treated subjects f rom both 2- arm 
and 3-arm randomization schedules, including subjects treated under previous versions of the protocol. However, the definition of the Intent to Treat (ITT) population has been 
clarified to include only 3-arm randomized subjects. The modified ITT population is also

 described as the population of treated and not only randomized subjects; this population 
will be used for sensitivity and supportive analysis.  
• Specific details of the efficacy analysis, including Berger -Boos correction, have been 
added now that the Statistical Analysis Plan has been completed, as well as clarifying 
why multiplicity adjustments  are not needed .  
• The administrative interim analysis is described.  
Protocol template language regarding safety assessments has been updated.  The definition of 
serious adverse events, and reporting of SAEs are better defined and consistent with other 
protocols. The definition, particularly regarding the timing, of vision loss post- treatment as an 
SAE is better defined.  
The Data Monitoring Committee for Part II, which will participate in the interim analysis, is now 
described.  
Additional minor changes are defined in the following Summary of Changes table.  
 
RATIONALE FOR SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENT  
PROTOCOL AMENDMENT XIRIUS VERSION 10.0 
 
In all previous versions of the protocol, a maximum time period of 8 weeks was allowed between 
the Baseline / Screening Visit and the day of surgery, Visit 2.  This has been changed in Version 10 to a window of 12 weeks between screening and surgery in order to provide operational 
flexibility for the sites and investigators and to minimize patient burden for participation in the 
study. This change in no way affects the safety and efficacy of the drug, the outcomes of the study, as well as the ultimate analyses of the datasets.

Summary of Changes: Protocol: NSR -RPGR -01  18 DEC  2018  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 3 of 44 
 Overview / Rationale : Changes to the Part II Dose -Expansion Phase of the Study  
From NSR -RPGR -01 Version 6.0 to 7.0, the protocol amendment changes the doses to be 
expanded in Part II from the “MTD and 3-dose levels lower than MTD” to dose 3 and dose 5. 
Rationale for this change was provided by the DMC at the October 2018 meeting. Although no DLTs have been identified through cohort 6 treated with the highest dose, and therefore a true MTD has not been identified in this dose- escalation, the committee recommended to expand 
dose 5 and dose 3, as the dos es most likely to define safety and efficacy of AAV8 -RPGR. In 
addition, regulatory agencies have recommended adding a third untreated arm to better establish efficacy and safety of the gene therapy .  Thus, the subjects will be  randomized in a 1:1:1 
allocat ion, with double masking to dose in the treated arms, and masked assessments of efficacy. 
The study duration has been shortened to 12 months of follow-up for Part II dose-expansion because a long -term follow -up study will be initiated to continue follow-up of all AAV8 -RPGR 
subjects from 12 months to out to 5 years. Phase 1 subjects will still be followed for 24 months, and then also invited to participate in the long- term study.  
The endpoints and inclusion criteria are now separated by study Part to improve clarity.  
An efficacy endpoint, microperimetry at 3 months, has been added to Part II based on early 
efficacy signals observed during dose- escalation. Related to this, an inclu sion range for 
microperimetry has been added to Part II in order to assure the inclusion of subjects with modifiable disease and to avoid inclusion of those with microperimetry values subject to ceiling effects.   
Additionally, to further our understanding of the effects of AAV8 -RPGR, assessments of 
,  
 and quality of life questionnaires have been added, the former two only in sites with 
the available technology. Som e assessments ( reading test,  color vision, and full-field threshold 
sensitivity [FST]) have been removed from the study assessments due to the excessive burden of 
study visits on the subjects, and the limited value of these assessments in understanding both the disease and the effects of the drug.  
To improve safety and to prevent potential inflammatory response to therapy, the steroid regimen has been modified.  A standardized adult starting dose of 60 mg has been selected (rather than 
the previous 1mg/kg starting dose) and the taper has been lengthened  to include coverage out to 
approximately 2 months. A 2-month visit has been added to assess the subjects at the end of the 
steroid therapy .  
Information  on the procedures related to unmasking has been added to comply with Good 
Clinic al practices. Serious adverse event reporting has also been changed to immediately instead 
of within 7 days, per regional recommendations. 
From NSR -RPGR Version 7.0 to Version 7.1, this administrative protocol amendment clarifies 
the procedures and requirements for assessments done at each visit compared to the Schedule of 
Study Procedures .  Footnotes for BCVA assessment, Immunogenicity sampling, and 
corticosteroid review were added to the in -text footnotes and Schedule of Study Procedures.  In 
addition, Fundus photography was removed from Visit 6 and Visit 7, viral shedding was removed from Visit 6, and autofluorescence assessment was added to the Unscheduled Visit.  Updates were made to the protocol to accommodate these changes.

Study Design  
Page s 6-7 The study will be 
conducted in two parts: 
Part I is a dose escalation 
study, Part II is a 
Maximum Tolerated Dose 
(MTD) expansion study 
(as determined in Part I)  This is a Phase 1/2 /3… 
Part I is a dose -selection study; Part 
II is a d ose-expansion study, with 2 
doses (2.5 × 10^ 11 gp [high dose], 5 
× 10^10 gp [low dose]) selected 
from Part I based on a benefit/risk 
assessment, and a third untreated 
group to allow for a controlled 
comparison of efficacy and safety.   Study design 
descrip tion updated 
to include Part I 
and Part II. Part II 
now defines doses 
as high and low 
doses and not as 
MTD since the 
chosen high dose to 
be expanded has 
not been defined as 
MTD.  
The study will consist 
of visits over a 24-month 
evaluation period.  
 
At the 
Screening/Baseline Visit, 
each subject will be 
assessed for eligibility of 
both eyes. Only 1 eye 
will receive treatment 
(the “study eye”), and the 
untreated  eye will be 
designated as the “fellow 
eye”.   Part I consists  of 12 visits over a 24 -
month e valuation period.  
 
Part II consists of 10 visits over a 
12-month evaluation period. Only 1 
eye will be randomized  (the “study 
eye”), and the other eye will be 
designated as the “fellow eye”.  
Selection of the “study eye” will be 
made on clinical grounds prior to 
randomization and will generally be 
the worse eye affected. Differentiates the 
visit number and 
duration for Parts I 
and II  
 Subjects in the untreated control 
group will receive study -visit 
telephone calls to monitor 
AEs/SAEs and review concomitant 
medications on Visit 2 (Day 0) and 
on Visits 3 and 4 (post -operative 
Days 1 and 7).  Information on

Study data will be collected for both 
eyes of each subject. Since treatment 
requires an in vasive surgical

Overall Design 
Page s 22- 25 -   Part II is a Maximum 
Tolerated Dose (MTD) 
expansion study (as 
determined in Part I).  This is a Phase 1/2 /3… 
 The study will be conducted in two 
parts: Part I is a dose escalation study, Part II is a dose -expansion 
study, with 2 doses selected from Part I based on safety and efficacy, and a third untreated group to allow 
for a controlled comparison of 
efficacy.  
Part I will identify the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) using a dose -
escalation scheme. Part II will 
expand 2 doses, allowing for a 
broader assessment of the safety and efficacy of AAV8 -RPGR with a 
larger sample size, including 45 subjects randomized 1:1:1 to the a 
high-dose, a low -dose, and an 
untreated arm.  Part I primarily evaluates safety, defined by incidence of DLTs and TEAEs over a 24-month period.  Phase II 
evaluates safety and efficacy, with inclusion of a primary efficacy 
endpoint, improvement from 
Baseline in microperimetry, evaluated at 3 months, and safety and secondary efficacy evaluated at 1-, 6-, 9- and 12 -months post -
treatment.

will be followed for 12 months with 
the pre -specified visit schedule. 
At study completion, all subjects 
will be invited to participate in a 
separate long -term follow -up study 
that will collect efficacy and safety 
data up to  5 years from surgery . 
The study will consist of  
visits over a 24-month 
evaluation period.   Part I consists of 12 visits over a 24-
month evaluation period.  Part II 
consists of 10 visits over a 12- month 
period  Differentiated Part 
I and Part II visit number and 
duration  
 To minimise inflammation resulting 
from surgery and/or 
vector/transgene, in Part I , all 
subjects will be given a 21-day 
course of oral corticosteroi d. 
In Part II, all subjects will be treated 
at the time of surgery with up to 1 mL of triamcinolone (40 mg/mL), 
placed behind the globe via a deep sub-Tenon approach.  Subjects will 
also be given a 9 -week course of 
oral corticosteroid starting 3 days before surgery: 21 days at 60 mg, 
followe d by 6 weeks of tapering 
doses. The dose regimen is adjusted 
for pediatric subjects treated in Part II (see Section 9.8).  
Subjects in the untreated control group will receive study -visit 
telephone calls to monitor AEs/SAEs and review concomitant medication s on Visit 2 (Day 0) and 
on Visit 3 and 4 ( post-operative 
Days 1 and 7). • To improve 
safety and to 
prevent potential inflammatory response to therapy, the steroid regimen 
has been 
modified.  A standardized adult starting dose of 60 mg has been selected 
(rather than the 
previous 1mg/kg 
starting dose) and the taper has been lengthened to include 
coverage out to 
approximately 2 months. A 2 -
month visit has been added to 
assess the 
subjects at the end of the steroid therapy.

In Part II, subjects will be 
randomized to ‘ MTD 
cohort’ or the ‘active -
control  The active -control 
cohort will be three dose -
levels below the MTD. 
This assures a 1 -1.5-log 
differenc e in dose between 
these two cohorts, and 
allows for identifying a 
dose response while 
mitigating the possibility 
of a subtherapeutic low 
dose.  In Part II, subjects will be 
randomized to a high -dose (2.5 × 
10^11 gp), a low -dose (5 × 10^10 
gp), and an untreated group.   This 
allows for comparisons in a 
randomized and controlled fashion, 
as recommended by regulators for best practices in ophthalmic gene therapy studies (Human Gene Therapy for Retinal Disorders, Draft Guidance for Industry July 2018).  
The sponsor, investigator and the subject will be unmasked to the study procedure and treatment (i.e. vitrectomy and sub -retinal 
injection). However, within the 
treated groups, the sponsor, 
investigator and subject will be masked (i.e. double -masked) to the 
assigne d dose. To further minimise 
potential bias of the treated and non -
treated eye evaluations, all 
subjective ophthalmic assessments at 
the Screening/Baseline Visit (Visit 1) and from Month 1 (Visit 5) onwards will be conducted by a 
masked assessor.  Part II de scription 
now identifies treatments as dose 5 and dose 3 and untreated arm

Study Masking  
Page 3 3-34 Part II is double -masked 
(subject, surgeon, 
investigator/site team, sponsor will be masked to the assigned dose, and open -label with respect to 
the treatment administration).  In Part II, all ophthalmic 
assessments that are conducted at the Screening/Baseline Visit will be conducted by appropriately qualified masked assessors.  For the immediate post -operative visits, 
masking of the assessors will not be viable as clinical signs of surgery will be apparent (i.e. redness, 
swelling). Therefore, unmasked assessors will perform all 
ophthalmic assessments at Visit 3 
(Day 1) and Visit 4 (Day 7). For Visit 5 (Month 1) onwards, masked assessors will be used, as any signs of surgery will have dissipated and it will not be possible clinically to 
differentiate between those subjects 
that have not undergone surgery, and those subjects that have undergone surgery and received active treatment.  
Subjects randomised to the untreated 
Control group will not be required to 
attend the site at Visit 2, 3 or 4. As the key purpose of Visit 2 is surgery, and Visit 3 and 4, post -operative 
safety, there is limited utility in 
Control subjects attending. 
Therefore, to limit the study burden for Control subjects thereby poten tially reducing the risk of 
subject withdrawal at this stage and reducing the possibility of further 
unmasking due to direct contact and 
communication with fellow participants, Control subjects are not scheduled to attend the clinic for study visits at the se times.  
In order to minimise bias further, 
masked assessors will not have 
access to the subject’s medical records, source documentation or 
eCRF as data entries or notation Clarified masking

(such as use of peri -operative 
corticosteroid) may be sources of 
unmasking. From V isit 5 (Month 1) 
onwards, the masked assessor will also read a pre- written statement to 
each subject, regardless of randomisation, reminding them of the masked nature of the study, and to avoid any reference to prior surgery/non -surgery, which eye may 
have  received treatment or to allude 
to any information that may unmask the assessor as to which group the subject has been assigned to.  
Furthermore, it is anticipated that a subset of the subjects participating in 
the trial will be active on social 
media. Fo llowing appropriate 
approval by the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB), the patient information leaflet will request that 
subjects refrain from posting any 
details of study participation on social media, that may unmask the  
assessors to the group the subject has been assigned to. This request will be reiterated at subject visits by 
the investigator and within the pre -
written statement.  
Subjects randomised to the AAV8 -
RPGR treatment groups, surgeons, 
the investigative team an d the study 
sponsor will be masked to which 
dose of AAV8 -RPGR the subject 
has been assigned to. Unmasked 
study site personnel will be assigned the responsibility of performing dilution, which will take place in a 
designated area remote from the 
investigati ve team to preserve 
masking of the treatment arm. Personnel delegated to perform the dilution will not be involved in any other aspect of the study (i.e., 
consent, safety/efficacy assessments,

In Part I, all subjects will also be 
prescribed  a 21-day course of oral 
prednisone/prednisolone, following 
closely the 17 -day protocol 
established in the Philadelphia AAV 
gene therapy clinical trial (Maguire et al., 2008 ), except allowing an 
extra 4 days for tapering the dose at the end of the course , i.e., 
1 mg/kg/day prednisone / 
prednisolone for a total of 10 days 
(beginning 2  days before the vector 
injection, on the day of injection, and then for 7  days); followed  by 
0.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days; 
0.25 mg/kg/day for 2 days; and 
0.125  mg/kg/day for 2  days (21 days

 In Part II, at the time of surgery, all 
subjects (adult and pediatric) will be treated with up to 1 mL of triamcinolone, 40 mg/mL solution, which must be placed behind the globe via a deep sub -Tenon 
approach.  In addition, all subjects 
will be prescribed a course of oral 
corticosteroids.  
For adults, 60 mg of oral prednisone 
/ prednisolone will be prescribed for the initial 21 days (starting 3 days prior to surgery), followed by a

corticosteroid therapy should be re-
initiated, via oral and/or intraocular route, based on the clinical condition of the subject, and the judgement of 
the investigator.  
For pediatric subjects, oral 
prednisolone/prednisone will also be started 3 days prior to surgery. The starting dose will be based on kilogram weight of the subject, up to 
a maximum of 60 mg starting dose 
(rounded to the nearest 1 mg). Subsequent doses will have multipliers to provide the appropriate taper over an additional

Procedures for 
Unmasking  
Page 53  Proce dures for 
Unmasking  
The Investigator has the 
ability to unmask an 
individual subject’s 
treatment assignment, but 
this capability is restricted 
to medical emergencies in 
which knowledge of the 
subject’s treatment is 
critical to the 
Investigator’s ability to  
treat the subject.  
In such a case, the 
Investigator must first 
attempt to contact the 
Medical Monitor or 
backup to discuss the 
rationale for unmasking.  
If the Investigator 
determines that the 
conditions above are met,  
then s/he unmasks the Procedures for Unmasking  
The Investigator has the ability to 
unmask an individual subject’s 
treatment assignment,  in order to 
provide emergency treatment. 
Unmasking is appropriate when 
knowledge of the subject’s dose 
would affect the medical 
management of the subject.  
If the Investigator determines 
unmasking is required,  then s/he 
unmasks the subject through the 
Electronic Data Capture (EDC) 
system, files the resulting 
confirmation in a restricted file 
until the end of the study, and 
notifies the Medical Monitor within 
24 hours that the subject’s 
treatment assignment has been 
unmasked.  The Investigator will 
not communicate the treatment 
assignment to the Medical Monitor 
or to any sponsor  or study team New section added 
per G CPs 
regarding 
unmasking 
procedures  
 
Changes to the 
unmasking 
procedure have 
been added to 
align more closely 
to GCP guidelines

 Overview / Rationale : Changes to the Part II Dose- Expansion Phase of the Study  
This protocol amendment changes the doses to be expanded in Part II from the “MTD and 3-dose 
levels lower than MTD” to dose 3 and dose 5. Rationale for this change was provided by the DMC at the Octo ber 2018 meeting. Although no DLTs have been identified through cohort 6 
treated with the highest dose, and therefore a true MTD has not been identified in this dose-escalation, the committee recommended to expand dose 5 and dose 3, as the doses most likel y to 
define safety and efficacy of AAV8 -RPGR. In addition, regulatory agencies have recommended 
adding a third untreated arm to better establish efficacy and safety of the gene therapy .  Thus  the 
subjects will be  randomized in a 1:1:1 allocation , with double masking to dose in the treated 
arms, and masked assessments of efficacy . 
The study duration has been shortened to 12 months of follow-up for Part II dose-expansion because a long -term follow -up study will be initiated to continue follow- up of all AAV8 -RPGR 
subjects from 12 months to out to 5 years. Phase 1 subjects will still be followed for 24 months, and then also invited to participate in the long- term study.  
The endpoints and inclusion criteria are now separated by study Part to improve clarity.  
An efficacy endpoint, microperimetry at 3 months, has been added to Part II based on early 
efficacy signals observed during dose-escalation. Related to this, an inclusion range for microperimetry has been added to Part II in order to assure the inclusion of subjects with 
modifiable disease and to avoid inclusion of those with microperimetry values subject to ceiling effects.   
Additionally, to further our understanding of the effects of AAV8- RPGR, assessments of 
  
, and quality of life questionnaires have been added, the former two only in sites with 
the available technology. Some assessments ( reading test,  color vision, and full-field threshold 
sensitivity [FST]) have been removed from the study assessments due to the excessive burden of 
study visits on the subjects, and the limited value of these assessments in understanding both the disease and the effects of the drug.  
To improve safety and to prevent potential inflammatory response to therapy, the steroid regimen has been modified.  A standardized adult starting dose of 60 mg has been selected (rather than 
the previous 1mg/kg starting dose) and the taper has been lengthened to include coverage out to approximately 2 months. A 2-month visit has been added to assess the subjects at the end of the 
steroid therapy .  
Information  on the procedures related to unmasking has been added to comply with Good 
Clinic al practices. Serious adverse event reporting has also been chang ed to immediately instead 
of within 7 days, per regional recommendations. 
Page numbers on the following table of changes refer to the tracked changes version of the 
protocol amendment.

group to allow for a controlled 
comparison of efficacy and safety.   MTD since the 
chosen high dose to 
be expanded has 
not been defined as 
MTD.  
The study will consist 
of visits over a 24-month 
evaluation period.  
 
At the 
Screening/Baseline Visit, 
each subject will be 
assessed for eligibility of 
both eyes. Only 1 eye 
will receive treatment 
(the “study eye”), and the 
untreated  eye will be 
designated as the “fellow 
eye”.   Part I  consist s of 12 visits over a 24-
month evaluation period.  
 
Part II consists of 10 visits over a 
12-month evaluation period.  Only 1 
eye will be randomized  (the “study 
eye”), and the other eye will be 
designated as the “fellow eye”.  
Selection of the “study eye” will be 
made on clinical grounds prior to 
randomization and will generally be 
the worse eye affected. Differentiates the 
visit number and 
duration for Parts I 
and II  
 Subjects in the untreated control 
group will receive study -visit 
telephone calls to monitor 
AEs/SAEs and review concomitant 
medications on Visit 2 (Day 0) and 
on Visits 3 and 4 (post -operative 
Days 1 and 7).  Information on 
conduct for 
untreated control 
subjects has been 
added regarding the 
surgery day and 
post-operative 
Days 1 and 7.  
To minimise 
inflammation resulting 
from surgery and/or 
vector/transgene , all 
subjects will be given a 
21-day course of oral 
corticosteroid (e.g., 
prednisolone/prednisone) 
that will start 2 days 
before the planned date 
of surgery.  To minimise inflammation resulting 
from surgery and/or 
vector/transgene , in Part I , all 
subjects will be given a 21-day 
course of oral  corticosteroid (e.g., 
prednisolone/prednisone) that will 
start 2 days before the planned date 
of surgery.  
In Part II, all subjects will be treated 
at the time of surgery with up to 1 
mL of triamcinolone (40 mg/mL), 
placed behind the globe via a deep 
sub-Tenon approach.  All subjects 
will also be given a 9 -week course 
of oral corticosteroid starting 3 days 
before surgery: 21 days at 60 mg, 
followed by 6 weeks of tapering 
doses. The dose regimen is adjusted 
for pediatric subjects treated in Part 
II (see Sect ion 9.8).   To improve safety 
and to prevent 
potential 
inflammatory 
response to 
therapy, the steroid 
regimen has been 
modified.  A 
standardized adult 
starting dose of 60 
mg has been 
selected (rather 
than the previous 
1mg/kg starting 
dose) and the taper 
has been 
length ened to 
include coverage 
out to 
approximately 2 
months. A 2 -month

Part II: MTD  Expansion 
Study  
 Part II: Dose  Expansion  
In Part II, 45 subjects will be 
randomized 1:1:1 to a high- dose 
(2.5 × 10^11 gp), a low -dose 
(5 × 10^10 gp), and a third untreated 
group to allow for a controlled 
comparison of efficacy and safety.  
Study data will be collected for both 
eyes of each subject. Since treatment 
requires an invasive surgical 
procedure under general anaesthesia, 
the sponsor, investigator and the 
subject will be unmasked to the 
study procedure (i.e., vitrectomy and 
sub-retinal injection), however 
within the treated groups, the 
sponsor, investigator and subject 
will be masked to the assigned dos e. 
To further minimise potential bias of 
the treated and non -treated eye 
evaluations, all subjective 
ophthalmic assessments at the 
Screening/Baseline Visit (Visit 1) 
and from Month 1 (Visit 5) onwards 
will be conducted by a masked 
assessor.  Clarified 
rando mization for 
Part II Dose 
Expansion as 3 -

untreated arm 
added, per general 
rationale above.  
Added language 
explaining the 
assessor masking . 
Once the MTD has been 
identified, up to 45 
additional subjects will be 
randomized, in a 2:1 
allocation ratio.  Subjects 
will receive AAV8 -RPGR 
either at the MTD (MTD 
cohort), or at a low dose 
(active -control cohort), 
three dose- levels below 
the MTD (e.g., low dose = 
5 x 1010 gp if MTD = 
5x1011 gp).  Part II of the 
study will be randomized 
and dou ble-masked to the 
assigned dose, and open -Subjects, sponsor, investigators and 
clinical assessors will be masked to 
the assigned dose.   
All Part II subjects will be followed 
for 12 months with the pre -specified 
visit schedule.  At study completion, 
Part II subjects will be invited to 
participate in a separate long -term 
follow -up study that will collect 
efficacy and safety data from Month 
12 through 5 years from surgery . Clarified

for a controlled comparison of 
efficacy.  
Part I will identify the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) using a dose -
escalation scheme. Part II will 
expand 2 doses, allowing for a 
broader assessment of the safety and efficacy of AAV8 -RPGR with a 
larger sample size, including 45 subjects randomized 1:1:1 t o the a 
high-dose, a low -dose, and an 
untreated arm.  Part I primarily evaluates safety, defined by incidence of DLTs and TEAEs over a 24-month period.  Phase II 
evaluates safety and efficacy, with 
inclusion of a primary efficacy 
endpoint, improvement from  
Baseline in microperimetry, evaluated at 3 months, and safety and secondary efficacy evaluated at 1-, 6-, 9- and 12 -months post -
treatment.  
All Part II subjects treated under 
previous versions of the protocol will be followed for 12 months with the pre -specified visit schedule. 
At study completion, all subjects 
will be invited to participate in a separate long -term follow -up study 
that will collect efficacy and safety 
data up to  5 years from surgery . 
The study will consist of  
visits over a 24-month 
evaluation period.   Part I consists of 12 visits over a 24-
month evaluation period.  Part II 
consists of 10 visits over a 12- month 
period  Differentiated Part 
I and Part II visit 
number and 
duration  
 To minimise inflammation resulting 
from surgery and/or 
vector/transgene, in Part I , all 
subjects will be given a 21-day 
course of oral corticosteroi d. 
In Part II, all subjects will be treated at the time of surgery with up to 1 mL of triamcinolone (40 mg/mL), placed behind the globe via a deep sub-Tenon approach.  Subjects will 
also be given a 9 -week course of 
oral corticosteroid starting 3 days before s urgery: 21 days at 60 mg, 
followed by 6 weeks of tapering • To improve safety and to prevent potential inflammatory response to 
therapy, the 
steroid regimen has been modified.  A standardized adult starting

subjects at Visits 2, 3 and 4 has been added  
The efficacy evaluation 
will be based  on BCVA, 
SD-OCT, fundus 
autofluorescence, microperimetry, visual 
fields, contrast sensitivity, 
low luminance visual acuity (LLVA), full-field 
stimulus threshold test 
(FST), colour vision, and 
reading test.   Any safety 
information collected as a result of the efficacy assessments (e.g., BCVA) 
will also be used in the 
overall safety evaluation, as applicable. 
Subjects who develop cataracts may undergo cataract surgery if deemed 
clinically necessary; if 
surger y is performed, it 
should be carried out at least 4 weeks before Visit 1 (Year 1) or Visit 11 
(Year 2).

Study data will be collected for both eyes of each subject. Since treatment requires an invasive surgical procedure under general anaesthesia, the sponsor, investigator and the subject will be unmasked to the 
study procedure (i.e., vitrectomy and 
sub-retinal injection), however 
within the treated groups, the sponsor, investigator and subject will be masked to the assigned dose. To further minimise potential bias of

mitigating the possibility 
of a subtherapeutic low 
dose.  In Part II, subjects will be 
randomized to a high -dose (2.5 ×

Study Masking  
Page 3 6-37 Part II is double -masked 
(subject, surgeon, investigator/site team, sponsor will be masked to the assigned dose, and open -label with respect to 
the treatment 
administration).  In Part II, all ophthalmic 
assessments that are conducted at the 
Screening/Baseline Visit will be conducted by appropriately qualified masked assessors.  For the immediate post -operative visits, 
masking of the assessors will not be 
viable as clinical signs of surgery will be apparent (i.e. redness, swelling). Therefore, unmasked assessors will perform all ophthalmic assessments at Visit 3 (Day 1) and Visit 4 (Day 7). For 
Visit 5 (Month 1) onwards, ma sked 
assessors will be used, as any signs Clarified masking

 of surgery will have dissipated and it 
will not be possible clinically to 
differentiate between those subjects 
that have not undergone surgery, and 
those subjects that have undergone surgery and received active treatment.  
Subjects randomised to the untreated Control group will not be required to 
attend the site at Visit 2, 3 or 4. As 
the key purpose of Visit 2 is surgery, and Visit 3 and 4, post -operative 
safety, there is limited utility in Control subjects attendin g. 
Therefore, to limit the study burden 
for Control subjects thereby 
potentially reducing the risk of subject withdrawal at this stage and reducing the possibility of further unmasking due to direct contact and 
communication with fellow 
participants, Contr ol subjects are not 
scheduled to attend the clinic for study visits at these times.  
In order to minimise bias further, masked assessors will not have 
access to the subject’s medical 
records, source documentation or eCRF as data entries or notation (such as  use of peri -operative 
corticosteroid) may be sources of unmasking. From Visit 5 (Month 1) 
onwards, the masked assessor will 
also read a pre- written statement to 
each subject, regardless of randomisation, reminding them of the masked nature of the study, a nd 
to avoid any reference to prior 
surgery/non -surgery, which eye may 
have received treatment or to allude 
to any information that may unmask the assessor as to which group the subject has been assigned to.  
Furthermore, it is anticipated that a subset of the subjects participating in 
the trial will be active on social media. Following appropriate approval by the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional 
Review Board (IRB), the patient 
information leaflet will request that subjects refrain from posti ng any 
details of study participation on social media, that may unmask the assessors to the group the subject 
has been assigned to. This request

Section 9.8 
Concomitant Therapy  
Page s 37- 39  To minimise inflammation, at the 
time of surgery, all subjects will be 
treated with a course of 
corticosteroid.  
In Part I, all subjects will also be 
prescribed  a 21-day course of oral 
prednisone/prednisolone, following 
closely the 17 -day protocol 
established in the Philadelphia AAV 
gene therapy clinical trial (Maguire 
et al., 2008 ), except allowing an 
extra 4 days for tapering the dose at the end of the course , i.e., 
1 mg/kg/day prednisone / 
prednisolone for a total of 10 days 
(beginning 2  days before the vector 
injection, on the day of injection, and then for 7  days); followed  by

In Part II, at the time of surgery, all 
subjects (adult and pediatric) will be treated with up to 1 mL of 
triamcinolone, 40 mg/mL solution, 
which must be placed behind the globe via a deep  sub-Tenon 
approach.  In addition, all subjects • To improve safety and to prevent potential 
inflammatory 
response to therapy, the steroid regimen has been modified.  A 
standardized 
adult starting dose of 60 mg has been selected (rather than the 
previous 1mg/kg 
starting dose) and the taper has been  lengthened 
to include coverage out to 
approximately 2 
months. A 2 -
month visit has been added to assess the subjects at the 
end of the steroid 
therapy.

corticosteroids.  
For adults, 60 mg of oral prednisone

the initial 21 days (starting 3 days prior to surgery), followed by a 
weekly taper as follows for a total of 9 weeks of treatment:  
Day -3 through day 17 (21 days): 
60 mg by mouth once daily

 If at the Month -2 visit  (Visit 5.9) , 
inflammation is observed, corticosteroid therapy should be re -
initiated, via oral and/or intraocular route, based on the clinical condition of the subject, and the judgement of the investigator.  
For pediatric subjects, oral prednisolone/prednisone will also be 
started 3 days prior to surgery. The 
starting dose will be based on kilogram weight of the subject, up to a maximum of 60 mg starting dose (rounded to the nearest 1 mg).

The final assessment should be used 
to determine subject eligibility.   
If at sub sequent visits there are 
obvious technical challenges or the subject is not performing the assessment as expected from previous visits (e.g. distracted, large number of false positive responses, 
not maintaining fixation, etc), then

Page 5 7  Procedures for Unmasking  
The Investigator has the ability to unmask an individual subject’s 
treatment assignment, but this capability is restricted to medical emergencies in which knowledge of the subject’s treatment is critical to the Investigator’s ability to treat the 
subject. 
In such a case, the Investigator must first attempt to contact the Medical Monitor or backup to discuss the rationale for unmasking.  
If the Investigator determines that 
the conditions above are met, then 
s/he unmasks the subject through the New section added 
per GCPs regarding unmasking 
procedures

that the subject’s treatment 
assignment has been unmasked.  The Investigator will not communicate the treatment assignment to the 
Medical Monitor or to any sponsor or study team staff; nor should the 
treatment assignment be 
communicated to site staff other than those personnel who require that knowledge in order to treat the subject. 
The Investigator will ensure that the 
rationale, date, and time of unmasking is noted in the subject’s source documentation, but not the treatment assignment.  The medical emergency that necessitated 
unmasking must also be recorded in 
the source documentation and the case repor t form per standard study 
procedures.

of Part I , no formal sample size 
computation was performed.  
In Part II, A a sample size of 45 
subjects, 15 in each of 3 groups 
(high -dose, low -dose and untreated) ,

 Overview / Rationale 
This protocol amendment allowed for an expansion of an active-control cohort of subjects to 
occur concurrently w ith the expansion of the MTD cohort in a randomized, double- masked 
fashion. This change provides greater efficacy information through a comparison of low- and high-dose outcomes. The amendment also clarifies the consent procedures for subjects less under 
10 years of age, and removes assessments of low luminance best -corrected visual acuity, blood 
pressure, pulse, and safety blood sampling at various visits . The primary endpoint has been 
clarified regarding the incidence of dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) an d adverse events, and the 
secondary endpoints have been specified temporally.  Lastly, cohorts 5 and 6, which originally were optional, are now protocol-defined due to a lack of DLTs observed in the ongoing study in cohorts 1-4. Per the protocol, if DLTs are observed at cohort 5, no escalation to cohort 6 will occur.

interventional study of AAV8 -
RPGR in adult male subjects 
with genetically confirmed 
XLRP.  
 This is a P hase 1/2, first -in-
human,  multi -centre, dose-
escalation interventional study of AAV8 -RPGR in male 
subjects with ge netically 
confirmed XLRP.  The study 
will be conducted in two parts: Part I is a dose escalation study, Part II is a Maximum Tolerated Dose 
(MTD) expansion study (as 
determined in Part I).   
7.1 Overall Study 
Design  Only 1 eye will receive treatment (the “s tudy eye”), 
with the contra -lateral eye 
serving as the control (the 
“control eye”).   Only one eye will receive treatment (the “study eye”), and the untreated eye will be designated as  the “ fellow  
eye.”   Clearer definition of untreated eye

at any time during the study, 
the site is to report the event to the sponsor within 24 hours of occurrence. When triplicate BCVA assessments are performed at screening, the median BCVA result will be used fo r change -

AAV8 -RPGR doses of 5 × 109 
gp (Cohort  1), 1 × 1010 gp 
(Cohort 2), 5 × 1010 gp 
(Cohort 3), and 1 x 1011 gp 
(Cohort 4).   The study will involve up to 6 
dose cohorts, with AAV8 -
RPGR doses of 5 × 109 gp 
(Cohort  1), 1 × 1010 gp 
(Cohort 2), 5 × 1010 gp

Expansion Study   PART II: MTD EXPANSI ON 
STUDY 
Once the MTD has been 
identified, up to 45 additional subjects will be random ized, 
in a 2:1 allocation ratio.  
Subjects will receive AAV8 -
RPGR either at the MTD 
(MTD cohort), or at a low 
dose (active- control cohort), 
three dose- levels below the 
MTD (e.g., low dose = 5 x 1010 gp if MTD = 5x 1011 
gp).  Part II of the study will be randomized and double -
masked to the assigned dose, and open -label to the 
treatment administration.   
7.5 Number of Subjects  In a 4 -cohort trial, it is 
anticipated that up to 42 
subjects will be enrolled, 
dependent on toxicity 
observed.  Overall, the study is expected to enroll approximately 63 subjects: 18 in Part I and 45 in Part II. See Section 13.1 for 
rationale.   
7.6 Discussion of 
Study Design and 
Dose Selection  Once the safety and 
tolerability of AAV8 -RPGR is 
demonstrated in adults, 
subjects ≥10 years of age will be enrolled in the MTD cohort.  Once the MTD has been 
identified  and the safety and 
tolerability of AAV8 -RPGR is 
demonstrated in adults, subjects ≥10 years of age will be enrolled in Part II of  the 
study.   
7.6 Discussion of Study Design and Dose Selection   
In Part II, subjects will be randomized to the ‘MTD cohort’ or the ‘low -dose 
active -control cohort’.  This 
allows for a parallel, active -
control group and masking of the treatment dose, which will enhance the robustness of the efficacy and safety outcomes.  
The active- control cohort will 
be three dose- levels below the 
MTD. This assures a 1 -1.5-log 
difference in dose between 
these two cohorts, and allows 
for identifying a dose

15 Dec 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 3 of 5 
 
 Amendment 3.0, 15 Dec 2017 
Amendment:  
Updated study design to confirm assessment of Cohort 4 (1 x 1011 gp) as standard, and 
potential Cohorts 5 (2.5 x 1011 gp) and 6 (5 x 1011 gp). 
Rationale: 
To allow wider dose exploration, if appropriate.   
Sections: 
 Protocol synopsis 
 7.3 Dose escalation scheme 
Amendment:  
Updated study design to include additional Visits 10 (Month 18) and 11 (Year 2). 
Rationale: 
To allow longer duration of post-treatment follow-up (24 months in total), in line with 
feedback received from regulatory agencies.   
Sections: 
 Protocol synopsis 
 7.1 Overall study design 
 10.10 Visit 10 and 11 
 17.1 Schedule of study procedures 
Amendment:  
Updated Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) cohort eligibility criteria to include patients 
≥10 years of age. 
Rationale: 
To allow inclusion of a wider study population in the MTD cohort, after safety and 
tolerability is first demonstrated in adults, considering X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa is 
associated with early-onset of symptoms in childhood, and some children as young as 10 
years of age can have significant disease affecting the central macula (i.e. potential 
candidates for gene therapy).  
AAV8-RPGR 
Protocol: NSR -RPGR -01 Protocol Version 4.0 
15 Dec 2017  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 4 of 5 
 
 Sections: 
 Protocol synopsis 
 7.5 Discussion of study design and dose selection 
 8.1 Inclusion criteria 
Amendment:  
Updated eligibility criteria to specify that ellipsoid zone at screening must be within the 
borders of the SD-OCT scan.  
Rationale: 
To ensure that participating patients have active disease within the macular region. 
Otherwise, the central reading centre is unable to adequately grade the SD-OCT images, 
which would negatively impact secondary study endpoints.  
Sections: 
 Protocol synopsis 
 8.1 Inclusion criteria 
Amendment:  
Updated Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) definition to exclude events related to the surgical 
procedure.  
Rationale: 
From the literature, it is known that the vitrectomy almost always leads to a transient, but 
significant, drop in visual acuity immediately post-operatively. This can be confused with a 
DLT event and therefore clarification is provided in the protocol to ensure only genuine 
cases of DLTs are identified and reported.  
Sections: 
 Protocol synopsis 
 7.2 Dose limiting toxicity 
Amendment:  
Removed several study assessments from specific visits, e.g.:  
 Blood pressure & pulse (Visits 5, 9 and ET) 
 Viral shedding (Visit 6) 
AAV8-RPGR 
Protocol: NSR -RPGR -01 Protocol Version 4.0

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 of 5 
 
  FAF (Visit 4) 
 Triplicate MP and VF (Visits 9 and ET) 
Rationale: 
Following feedback from the central reading center, and several study sites, the utility of 
above assessment at these specific time-points is considered low. 
Sections: 
 10.4-10.6, 10.9 and 10.11 (Visits 4-6, 9 and ET) 
 17.1 Schedule of study procedures  
Amendment: 
Other minor changes throughout document.  
Rationale: 
To improve clarity or correct typographical errors.

Sections:  
• Protocol synopsis  
• 7.3 Dose escalation scheme  
• 8.1 Inclusion criteria  
Amendment:  
Low luminance visual acuity assessment and full field stimulus threshold have been added 
as additional assessments. LLVA will be conducted at the same timepoints as EDTRS 
BCVA, FST will be conducted at baseline/screening, month 6, year 1 and Early

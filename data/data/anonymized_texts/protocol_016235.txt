1) SYNOPSIS  and Section 5.6.1.1: The central wound rating group BWAT Reviewers will not 
be blinded to the visit order when completing BWAT ratings. BWAT was developed for 
sequential review of wound images  and images can be rated with the greatest accuracy 
if BWAT reviewers are able to refer to all of a subject’s images in chronological sequence.  
2) Section 5.6.1.2: Clarif ication that the qualitative reviewers will not be involved in 
confirmation of CUA lesions or BWAT rating. These qualitative reviewers are blinded to treatment assignment and visit order in Part 1, and to visit order in Part 2.  
3) Section 8.2.2: Clarification that the independent statistical service provider  will provide 
the conditional power and sample size computations to the independent DSMB only. The DSMB will review the results and then provide only the sample size 
recommendation to the Sponsor.

Study Title:  
A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study to Assess the Efficacy and 
Safety of SNF472 When Added to Background C are for the Treatment of Calciphylaxis  
Protocol Number: SNFCT2017- 06 
Indication: Treatment of calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriolopathy [ CUA ]) 
Sponsor: Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.  
Number of Subject s and Study Sites : Planned enrollment is  approximately 66  subjects from 
approximately 60 sites in multiple countries . Number of subjects may be adjusted up to a 
maximum of 99 based on results of a sample size re -estimation (SSRE).  
Study Objectives  
• To evaluate the efficacy of SNF472 compared with placebo when added to background care  
for the treatment of CUA  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SNF472 compared with placebo when added to 
background care  for the treatment of CUA  
Study Design and Methodology  
This Phase 3, global, multicenter study will examine the efficacy and safety of SNF472 in adult 
subjects on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) who have at least one ulcerated CUA lesion  
(wound) . The study will include a screening period  of up to 5 weeks , a 12-week double -blind, 
randomized, placebo -controlled treatment period (Part  1) followed by a 12- week open -label 
treatment per iod (Part  2), and a 4 -week follow- up period.   
Screening Period:  Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study procedures.  
Subject eligibility will be evaluated d uring the screening period, which will be conducted as a 
two- step process. In addition, the subject’s pain medications will be stabilized between 
Screening Visit 1 and Screening Visit 2  to determine the baseline maintenance pain medication 
dose . Completion of screening within 4 weeks or less is preferred but up to 5 weeks is allowed.  
Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
7 mg/kg of  SNF472 or matching placebo in a double -blind manner. Randomization will be 
stratified based on intravenous STS use at the time of randomization (yes/no).  
Double -blind, Randomized, Placebo-C ontrolled Treatment Period (Part 1): Subjects will 
receive SNF472 or placebo for 12 weeks in addition to background care (in accordance with the 
clinical practices of each site). No changes to the background care regimen , including pain

  Page 5 of 90 medication,  should be made after randomization unless medically indicated in the opinion of 
the Investigator.  
The Schedule of Events for the S creening Period and Part 1 is provided in Table 1. 
Open- label Treatment Period (Part 2): Subjects who complete Part 1 will be eligible to 
participate in Part 2, in which all subjects will receive open -label SNF472 for 12  weeks  and 
continue stable background care  (in accordance with the clinical practices of each site ), 
including pain medication, with no changes unless medically indicated  in the opinion of the 
Investigator .  
The Schedule of Events for Part 2 and the follow -up visit is provided in Table 2.  
Follow -Up Period / Early Termination : Subjects completing the study will return for a follow-up 
visit 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug . Subjects should continue on stable background 
care , including pain medication, during the 4 -week follow- up period. with no changes unless 
medically indicated  in the opinion of the Investigator . Subjects who discontinue study drug 
during Part 1 or Part 2 will be asked to complete study assessments throughout the respective 
part of the study (Part 1 or Part 2) and complete a follow -up visit.  
Subjects will record all pain medications used in a pain medication diary throughout Screening, 
Part 1, Part 2, and the follow -up per iod. Diaries should be reviewed with the subject at least 
weekly and pain medications will be recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF). 
The following assessments will be performed during this study: demographic  characteristics , 
medical history, p rior/concomitant medications , physical examination , body weight, vital signs , 
electrocard iograms (ECGs),  Holter monitoring , blood sampl es for central laboratory 
assessments (hematology,  chemistry, ionized calcium, parathyroid hormone [PTH], high -
sensitivity C -reactive protein [hs- CRP], and serum  pregnancy test [females of childbearing 
potential only]),  dialysis parameters, record CUA wound care, wound imag ing (photos and 
video)  and assessment (including Bates -Jensen Wound Assessment Tool [BWA T], qualitative 
wound evaluation, occurrence of new CUA lesions ), Pain Visual Analog  Scale (VAS) , 
Wound- Quality of Life [ Wound- QoL] questionnaire, review of subject diary of pain medications , 
adverse events (AEs),  HD-related events, and blood sampl es for pharmacokinetics (PK), 
pharmacodynamics (PD), and biomarkers. No DNA testing will be performed.  
All 13 items comprising the “ BWAT total” score will be assessed: size, depth, edges, 
undermining, necrotic tissue type, necrotic tissue amount, exudate type, exudate amount, skin 
color  surrounding wound, peripheral tissue edema, peripheral tissue induration, granulation 
tissue, and epithelialization. Endpoints will include the BWAT total score as well as a targeted 
modification of BWAT, the “ BWAT -CUA ”, which  focuses on the following 8 prototypical 
features of CUA lesions: necrotic tissue type, necrotic tissue amount, exudate type, exudate amount, skin color surrounding wound, peripheral tissue edema, peripheral tissue induration, and granulation tissue.  Sites  will captur e photos and videos of the wounds using the provided 
device and  imaging software and will receive training on BWAT and  rating of  undermining, 
peripheral tissue edema, and peripheral tissue induration. An expert central wound rating 
group  blinded to treatment will perform a quality  review of the site’s ratings and rate the 
remaining BWAT items based on review of the wound photos  and videos , aided by  automated

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL    Amendment 3, 9 DEC  2021 
  Page 6 of 90 measurements from imaging software  for the wound size assessment . If a subject has  more 
than one CUA lesion, the course of up to 3 of these (primary, secondary, tertiary) will be 
assessed with BWAT . Designation of lesions as primary, secondary, and tertiary will be defined 
based on the total area measured by the wound imaging software at screening.  The progress of 
the primary lesion will also be evaluated with a qualitative review by the central wound rating 
group. 
Pain VAS will be electronically administered, requiring the subject to mark a position on a 10-
cm long horizontal line to indicate the worst wound- related pain experienced during the 
previous  24 hours.  
The Wound- QoL questionnaire will also be electronically administered and consists of 17 
questions on impairments that are assessed in reference to the preceding 7  days.  
Safety information from this study will be reviewed by an external independent Data and 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) . 
Study Duration 
The planned length of participation in the study for each subject is up to approximately 
33 weeks (from screeni ng through completion of the follow-up visit). This includes:  
• Screening period of up to 5 weeks  
• Part 1 treatment period of 12 weeks  
• Part 2 treatment period of 12 weeks  
• Follow -up period of 4 weeks  
Test Product and Reference Therapy, Dose and  Mode of Administration 
The test product, SNF472, will be supplied as a 30mL sterile vial containing 30 mg/mL solution  
(900 mg)  in a blinded manner for Part 1 and in an unblinded manner for Part 2. Subjects 
randomized to active treatment for Part 1 will re ceive 7  mg/kg of SNF472 three times weekly 
(TIW) during dialysis session s. All subjects will receive 7 mg/kg of SNF472 TIW  during dialysis 
session s for Part 2.  
Placebo will be supplied in a blinded fashion as a physiological saline solution in a 30 mL sterile vial that is identical in appearance to the SNF472 test product.  Subjects randomized to placebo 
for Part 1 will receive placebo TIW during dialysis session s.  
In Part 1, weight for dosing calculation will be  the subject’s body weight recorded after 
hemodialysis during screening . In Part 2, weight for dosing calculation  will be the subject’s 
body weight recorded after hemodialysis at Week 12 Day 5 .  
SNF472 solution and placebo will be diluted in physiological saline and infused via the dialysis circu it over a period of approximately 2.5  – 3 hours.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL    Amendment 3, 9 DEC  2021 
  Page 10 of 90 Statistical Methods  
Alternate Primary Endpoints  
The comparison of absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in BWAT -CUA  score between 
treatment groups will be achieved using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis 
to estimate the difference between randomized treatment group least squares means (LS means) at 12 weeks. The model will include fixed effect terms for randomized treatment 
group , visit, and visit by randomized treatment group interaction. The model will be stratified 
for STS use at randomization  and baseline BWAT -CUA  score use will be included as a covariate. 
Subject will be fitted as a random effect and an unstructured variance -covariance matrix will be 
used. 
The comparison of absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in Pain VAS will be analyzed 
using an MMRM analysis similar to that for the change in BWAT -CUA  score with covariates of 
baseline Pain VAS and stratified for STS use  at randomization . 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints will be evaluated hierarchically.  The first s econdary efficacy endpoint 
of the absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in Wound -QoL score will be analyzed us ing an 
MMRM analysis similar to that for the alternate primary efficacy endpoints with baseline 
Wound- QoL score as a covariate and stratified for STS use  at randomization . The second  
secondary efficacy endpoint of the absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in the BWAT 
total score will be analyzed using an MMRM analysis with baseline BWAT total score as a 
covariate  and stratified by STS use  at randomization . The third secondary endpoint of 
qualitative wound image evaluation for the primary lesion at Week 12 will be analyzed using 
generalized estimating equations. Results will be displayed in terms of the odds ratio of SNF472 
vs placebo along with the associated 95% CI and 2 -sided p- value. The fourth secondary 
endpoint of rate of change in opioid use  from baseline  to Week 12 will be analyzed via a mixed 
model random coefficients analysis .  
Overall Type I Error Control  
To prevent any overall Type I error inflation , the alternate primary endpoints will be assessed 
using a Hochberg procedure with a 2 -sided alpha level of 4% . If both alternate primary 
endpoints are met, the alpha apportioned will be recycled so that the secondary endpoints will 
be assessed  hierarchically  at the 5% alpha level, 2 -sided. If only one alternate primary endpoint 
is met, the  secondary endpoints will be assessed hierarchically at the 1% alpha level, 2 -sided.  
Sample Size Re- estimation  
A SSRE procedure is planned when primary endpoint data is available from approximately 33 of 
the planned total of 66 subjects randomized and treated for 12 weeks . This procedure will be 
conducted blind to the sponsor by an external  independent statistical service provider . Any 
increase in sample size with be capped at 50% of the planned sample size  (i.e., the maximum 
total sample size will be c apped at 66 + 1/2 x 66 = 99 subjects). Details are provided in  Section 
8.2.2 .

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 INDICATION /BACKGROUND TO THE DISEASE 
1.1.1 Calciphylaxis 
Calciphylaxis is a rare disease seen predominantly in patients receiving dialysis. As of 31 
December 2015, t he number of patients on dialysis was approximately 430,519 in Europe and 
492,227 in the United States  (US)  (European Renal Association – European Dialysis and 
Transplant Association Registry, 2017 ; United States Renal Data System, 2017 ). Calciphylaxis in 
the end- stage renal disease (ESRD) population  is also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy 
[CUA]. The estimated prevalence of CUA is between 1% and 4% of the ESRD population ( Goel et 
al, 2011; Nunley, 2017; Schlieper et al, 2009) , suggesting a prevalence of 4, 305 to 17,221 in 
Europe and 4,9 23 to 19,691 in the US . In addition, recent estimates of incidence of CUA  have 
been reported as <1500 patients on dialysis in the US based on sodium thiosulfate (STS) use , 
0.12% of dialysis patients per year in the United Kingdom (UK Registry, personal communication 
with Smeeta Sinha), and 0.04% of dialysis patients per ye ar in Germany  (Brandenburg et al, 
2017).   
Calciphylaxis in patients with ESRD is a life -threatening condition with 1 -year mortality rates of 
45-55% (McCarthy et al, 2016; Nigwekar et al , 2016; Weenig et al , 2007 ). In addition, a high rate 
of mortality was observed within the first few months after diagnosis of CUA ( Mazhar et al, 
2001). Major surgical interventions are common in these patients with one study reporting that 
69% of patients required extensive debridement, revascularization, or amputation (Obialo and Quarshi 2017).   
The disease is characterized by accelerated soft tissue calcification, including calcification and thrombosis of smaller arteriolar vessels, leading to progressive and painful necrotic skin 
ulcerations  (Nigwekar et al, 2018) . The pathophysiology of CUA involves the deposition of 
calcium in the tunica media of smaller arteriolar vessels. The deposition of calcium is 
accompanied by local inflammation and arteriolar thrombosis, leading to regional ischemia and 
subsequent necrosis of subcutaneous fat and the overlying skin. The skin and subcutaneous lesions of CUA are the primary manifestation of the disease. Lesions most commonly appear in 
the lower extremities and in the trunk, particularly in the abdomen. Less commonly reported locations include the arms, hands and fingers, buttock/hip, chest, and genitals ( Chinnadurai et 
al 2021; Weenig et al, 2007 ) On palpation, skin and soft tissue surrounding necrotic areas often 
show a characteristic plaque -like hardening. The progressive, ischemic ulcers are extremely 
painful, and patients often require opioids for pain control. In addition to the pain, these 
patients have an increased susceptibility to wound infection, which is ultimately responsible for over 50% of the mortality ( Weenig et al, 2007 ). 
In these patients, calcification of arterial walls and heart valves leads to coronary heart disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular events, which are often fatal. While 
much remains unclear about the triggers for the pathogenic process of CUA , the vascular 
deposition of calcium appears to be a necessary, but possibly not a sufficient, factor in 
development of the full clinical profile. A diagnosis can be made based on clinical characteristics

 and can be confirmed by a skin biopsy which shows arterial calcification and occlusion in the 
absence of vasculitis.  
1.1.2 Current CUA Care  
There are currently no approved medicinal products or devices for the treatment of CUA , and 
no specific guidelines . Current care relies on 1) reducing clinical factors that may exacerbate the 
deposition of calcium in vascular tissue, 2) wound care, and 3) control of pain (Goel et al, 2011; Seethapathy et al, 2019 ). Clinical interventions aimed at reducing the impact of CUA  are listed 
below.  
• Topical wound care with measures to prevent infection 
• Pain management  
• Elimination of potential precipitating factors such as Vitamin K antagonist -based 
anticoagulation (e.g.,  warfarin, as a reduction in vitamin  K appears to promote calcium 
deposition) 
• Avoidance of calcium- based phosphate binder therapy  
• Reduction in vitamin D administration (as vitamin D appears to promote calcium deposition) 
• Use of low calcium concentration in the dialysis bath  
• Patients on peritoneal dialysis might benefit from switching to HD ( Fine and Fontaine, 
2008) with a low calcium dialysate.  
• Intensification of dialysis prescription 
• Treatment with calcimimetics such as cinacalcet or etelcalcetide (Robinson et al, 2007) 
• Parathyroidectomy  
• Hyperbaric oxygen might relieve ischemic features ( Podymow et al, 2001). 
• Bisphosphonates 
• Use of STS for pain control and potentially a reduction in calcium deposition 
None of the therapeutic interventions listed above have been subjected to adequate evaluation 
in controlled clinical trials . STS is widely used off- label for treatment of CUA although evidence 
supporting its efficacy is largely limited to re trospective chart reviews ( Nigwekar et al, 2013 ) 
and case reports ( Peng et al , 2018; Smith et al, 2012 ). Calcium- chelation, direct vascular 
calcification inhibitory  effects, antioxidant effects, and vasodilatory properties have all been 
proposed as mechanisms through which STS may improve CUA (as reviewed , O’Neill 2013). 
1.2 SNF472 
SNF472 is a selective calcification inhibitor that works by  binding to the growth sites of the 
hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystals . Chemically, SNF472 is  the hexasodium salt of myo -inositol 
hexaphosphate (IP6, phytate) . 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 27 of 90 
 SNF472 is being developed by Sanifit  Therapeutics S .A. (Sanifit) for the treatment of CUA and 
cardiovascular calcification  (CVC) in patients with ESRD undergoing HD.  
Multiple mechanisms lead to the formation and growth of calcified deposits in arterioles and 
other small vessels, which appear to be fundamental to the development of CUA. SNF472 is a 
novel entity with a new mechanism of action selectively directed to inhibit the final and 
common step in the pathway of vascular calcification by chemically blocking calcium crystal formation and growth. Regardless of the triggering mechanism for ectopic c alcification (e.g.,  
loss of calcification inhibitors, accumulated protein aggregates, inflammation, phenotypic osteogenic cellular transformation, or  disordered mineral metabolism), the final common 
pathway of HAP aggregation creates the  growing calcium cr ystal structure.  
The active ingredient of SNF472 is IP6, a natural substance found in beans, brown rice, corn, 
sesame seeds, wheat bran , and other high- fiber content foods. In mammalian tissues 
intracellular concentrations of IP6 are much higher than extracellular concentrations. Intracellular IP6  is naturally present at the 10 to 100  µM level and is formed de novo from IP3 
and the subsequent inositol polyphosphates family (IP4, IP5) ( Grases et al, 2004 ; Perelló et al, 
2004). Extracellular IP6 originates from dietary sources and reaches physiological levels in the 0.2 to 0.3 µM range ( Grases et al, 2000 ). The calcium salt of IP6 is listed by the US Food and 
Drug Adm inistration ( FDA) as Generally Recognized as Safe. It is highly polar and poorly 
absorbed when given orally.   
Based on current information, it is hypothesized that SNF472 is able to slow the process of vascular calcification by:  
• Blocking the formation and growth of HAP crystals in the blood vessels. SNF472 is a 
polyphosphate with a high affinity for solid calcium salts. It quickly binds the surface of a forming nucleus or on the faces of a growing crystal  and acts as an inhibitor of 
crystallization  since it specifically binds to the growth sites (not the entire crystal surface) , 
blocking the calcification process. An effect on the circulating colloidal calciprotein particles in the blood stream is also likely. SNF472 might be adsorbed on the surface of these 
nanoparticles, giving them negative charge and avoiding their aggregation to form the solid 
HAP crystal.  
• Preventing the transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) to an osteogenic 
phenotype. Osteogenic mechanisms play a role in the dev elopment of CVC and cells derived 
from the vascular media undergo bone and cartilage -like phenotypic change and 
calcification in vitro under various conditions, including elevated calcium and phosphorous (Jono et al, 2000; Yang et al, 2004). SNF472 has been demonstrated to interfere in the 
molecular mechanisms that lead to the de -differentiation of VSMC to osteoblast- like cells 
(unpublished data on file , Sanifit ). 
• Reducing bone mass loss, which is a source of circulating calcium, especially relevant in 
patients receiving HD in whom  there is an imbalance in the equilibrium of calcium between 
bone, blood , and soft tissues ( Grases et al, 2010 ).

 By stopping the progressive deposition of calcium within small arteriolar vessels, the principal 
pathologic al process underlying the development of the obliterative vasculopathy is halted. This 
is hypothesized to result in a reduction in pain and an improved ability for natural healing through neovascularization, white blood cell recruitment to fight infection, and a reduction in 
local inflammatory mediators.  
1.3 SNF472 N ONCLINICAL DATA  
SNF472 has been extensively studied in nonclinical models for efficacy, safety, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicity, and showed a promising profile  that supported  progression 
to studies in humans.  The results of nonclinical studies are summariz ed in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
In vitro and in vivo studies show that SNF472 inhibits calcification. In vivo studies show that 
SNF472 block s the deposition of calcium (in the form of HAP crystallization) in heart and aorta 
tissue. A pharmacodynamic (PD) assay developed for use as a biomarker of SNF472 activity 
demonstr ates that SNF472 reduce s HAP crystallization in plasma, thus likely preventing  further 
growth and progression of calcification in soft tissue and the vasculature. The initial validation 
of the PD assay was conducted in human and rat plasma ( Ferrer et al, 2017 ), in which the 
addition of SNF472 to plasma samples in vitro or in vivo  reduced the HAP crystalliz ation  rate. 
Subcutaneous administration of SNF472 in  rats reduced the HAP crystallization  potential of 
plasma up to 70%. Importantly, a correlation was shown between the PD assay results and 
vascular tissue calcification using the in vivo vitamin D model.  
Non clinical safety , reprotoxicolog y, and toxicolog y work has been completed, including  studies 
of up to 6  months in rats  and 9  months repeated -dose toxicology in dogs. No observed adverse 
effect levels obtained in these studies  establish a wide safety margin that provides appropriate 
toxicology support to proceed to clinical studies.  
Importantly, SNF472 did not significant ly inhibit or bind to  ion channels and transporters 
responsible for cardiac function, such as the human ether -a-go-go (hERG) channel. Therefore, 
SNF472 is not expected to have any direct effect on cardiac function in humans.  
In vitro,  SNF472 did not inhibit relevant human efflux transporters; uptake transporters; human 
cytochrome p450 ( CYP) 1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 ; and did 
not induce human CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4. Therefore, clinically relevant drug -drug 
interactions are not anticipated with SNF472 in humans.  
1.4 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE  
Two Phase 1 studies of SNF472 have been completed: SNFCT2012 -03 in healthy volunteers  and 
subjects receiving HD  and SNFCT2014- 03 in subjects with ESRD receiving HD . Two  Phase 2 
studies have been completed: SNFCT2 015-04 in subjects with CUA  and SNFCT2015 -05, to assess 
the effect of SNF472 on progression of CVC in addition to standard of care  in approximately  270 
subjects with ESRD receiving HD.

 1.4.1 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Results  
In the two Phase 1 studies  (SNFCT2012- 03 and SNFCT2014- 03), PK parameters were similar 
between healthy volunteers and subjects receiving  HD, indicating that HD therapy has little 
influence on the PK of SNF472. In both studies, the maximum observed concentration (C max) of 
SNF472 occurred  immediately following the end of the infusion, after which concentrations 
declined rapidly to below the limit of quantification (BLQ) within approximately 6 to 8 hours. 
The mean  half-life (t1/2) in these studies was between approximately 30  and 60 minutes . 
No accumulation of SNF472 over time was observed in either Phase 2 study. In SNFCT2015- 04 
(SNF472 doses of 5.6 - 8.6 mg/kg TIW) the C max of SNF472 was similar at Weeks 1 and 12 . In 
SNFCT2015 -05 (SNF472 doses of 300 mg or 600 mg  TIW) the C max of SNF472 was similar within 
dose groups at Weeks 1 and 52. 
Mean inhibitions of ex vivo HAP crystallization (PD assay) up to approximately 80% were 
observed in the Phase 1 studies and up to 65 -75% in the Phase 2 studies. Dose -PD relationship 
analysis using the human HD patient plasma samples  showed that SNF472 inhibited  systemic 
blood calcification with an IC 50 of 2.2 mg/kg and IC 80 of >5.6 mg/kg.  
1.4.2 SNFCT2015- 04, a Phase 2 Study in CUA  
SNFCT2015 -04 was a Phase 2 open -label, single -arm, repeat -dose study which examined the 
effect of SNF472 in addition to background care  on wound healing and other parameters of 
therapeutic response in 14 subjects with CUA  (Brandenburg et al 2019 ). SNF472 was 
administered at 3  HD sessions per week for 12 consecutive weeks. SNF472 (400 to 900 mg) was 
dosed according to body weight category, resulting in doses ranging from 5.6  to 8.6 mg/kg, 
adm inistered by a constant infusion during the dialysis session of approximately 2.5 to 3 hours 
in duration.  
Wound healing, pain, and quality of life (QoL) were  assessed using the Bates -Jensen Wound 
Assessment Tool  (BWAT), independent qualitative review of w ound images, the Pain Visual 
Analog Scale ( VAS), and the Wound- QoL questionnaire. BWAT total is a standardized tool for 
quantitative assessment of wound healing which rates wounds according to these 13 items:  
size, depth, edges, undermining, necrotic tissue type, necrotic tissue amount, exudate type, exudate amount, surrounding skin color, peripheral tissue edema, peripheral tissue induration, granulation tissue, and epithelialization.   
Consistent improvement was observed across all of these measures. A sta tistically significant 
improvement from baseline in wound healing of the primary lesion was observed at Weeks 10 
and 12 as measured by the BWAT  total. The mean decrease from baseline in BWAT total score 
at Week 12 was 8.1 (p<0.001). Independent review of wound images closely followed the BWAT 
scores with the same trend in improvement observed in most subjects. In addition, reductions 
in Pain VAS were observed starting from Week 6. The mean decrease from baseline in Pain VAS 
at Week 12 was 23.6 mm (p=0.015). I mprovements in the Wound- QoL questionnaire global  
score were observed with a mean decrease from baseline at Week 12  of 0.9 units (p=0.003) .  
In a post -hoc analysis, a targeted  modification of the BWAT, the “BWAT -CUA” was developed 
with input from an interdisciplinary group of experts  in calciphylaxis and wound care . The 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 30 of 90 
 BWAT -CUA items focus on the most clinically relevant features of CUA lesions: necrotic tissue 
type, necrotic tissue amount, exudate type, exudate amount, skin color surrounding wound, 
peripheral tissue edema, peripheral tissue induration, and granulation tissue. Each item  was 
scored on a scale of 1 to 5 with a range of possible scores from 8 to 40. Mean (SE) BWAT -CUA 
improved from 21.2 ± 2.0 at baseline to 14.9 ± 1.4 at Week 12 (p<0.002; Sinha et al, 2018 ).  
1.4.3 SNFCT2015- 05, A Phase 2 Study E valuating Safety and Efficacy on Progression of 
CVC 
SNFCT2015 -05 (CaLIPSO) is a completed Phase 2b, randomized, double -blind, placebo-
controlled  study that assessed the effect of 2 dose levels of SNF472 (300 mg  and 600 mg) on 
progression of CVC when added to standard care in subjects with ESKD on HD ( Raggi 2020). A 
total of  273 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug:  SNF472 300 mg (n=92), SNF472 
600 mg (n=91), or placebo (n=9 0) administered by intravenous (IV) infusion TIW during dialysis 
for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in coronary artery calcium (CAC) volume score 
from baseline to Week 52 as measured by CT scan . In the modified Intent to Treat (ITT) 
population, SNF472 significantly reduc ed the progression of CAC compared with placebo: the 
mean change in CAC volume score was 11% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7% to 15%) in the 
SNF472 combined dosing group compared with 20% (95% CI, 14% to 26%) in the placebo group (p=0.016 vs SNF472). Additionally, SNF472 significantly reduc ed the progression of calcium 
volume score relative to placebo  in the aortic valve (14% [95% CI: 5% to 24%] versus 98% [95% 
CI: 77% to 123%]; p<0.001) but not in the thoracic aorta (23% [95% CI: 16% to 30%] versus 28% 
[95% CI, 19– 38]; p=0.40).  
1.4.4 Safety and Tolerability Results with SNF472 
SNF472 has been well tolerate d in clinical studies to date.  
In Study SNFCT201 2-03 (N=28) , the majority of non -serious adverse events  (AEs) observed in 
healthy volunteers were infusion site -related events that were considered to be related to 
SNF472 by the Investigator . In HD subjects , similar infusion site -related adverse events  were 
not observed as SNF472 was infused through the dialysis circuit with dilution in blood before 
reaching the subject’s blood vessels.  There were mild to moderate AEs reported in the multiple 
ascending dose Study SNFCT2014- 03 but none were considered related to SNF472 .  
In the open -label Phase 2 CUA Study SNFCT2015 -04 (N=14), AEs reported in more than one 
subject were cellulitis, diarrhea, prolonged QT interval, fluid overload, hypertension, hypoesthesia, nausea, and skin lesion (n=2 each) ; all other AEs were reported in 1  subject . Most 
of the AEs were mild to moderate in intensity.   
In Study SNFCT2015 -05 (CaLIPSO) , the most common treatment- emergent AEs for which 
subject incidences were higher in the combined SNF472 treatment group than in the placebo 
group by a difference of at least 2% were abdominal pain upper (7.1% vs 2.2%), atrial fibrillation 
(6.6% vs 2.2%), hypoglycemia (6.6% vs 1.1%), hyperkalemia (6.0% vs 3.3%), and hyperphosphatemia (3.8% vs 0%). All subjects in this study with AEs of hypoglycemia had a history of diabetes, most AEs of hypoglycemia were mild to moderate, all but one were

 considered not related to study drug, and all resolved.  The AEs of hyperkalemia and 
hyperphosphatemia were expected in subjects on HD.  
Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported by 1  subject (polycystic kidney infection) in the Phase  1 Study 
SNFCT2014 -03 (N=18) and by 7 subjects in the Phase  2 Study SNFCT2015- 04. The SAEs reported 
in Study SNFCT2015 -04 were abdominal wound dehiscence, cardiogenic shock, cellulitis, dry 
gangrene, fluid overload, gangrene, hematemesis, hypertensive emergency, nausea, pulmonary 
edema, renal failure, sepsis, and urinary tract infection, n=1  for each . Most of the SAEs are 
commonly seen in this patient population. None of the SAEs  reported in either study  were 
consi dered related to SNF472 by the I nvestigator. In Study SNFCT2015 -05, the most commonly 
reported SAE was renal transplant which was similar between combined SNF472 dose group 
and placebo (10.9% vs. 10.0%) . Renal transplants are expected in this population and meet SAE 
criteria (hospitalization) but are not considered a negative outcome in this popula tion. The 
other SAE that was reported for more than 5% of subjects overall was pneumonia (3.8% in the 
combined dose groups and 7.8% in the placebo group).  The following SAEs were reported for 
no subjects in the placebo group and >3% of subjects in the SNF4 72 600 mg group: cardiac 
arrest  (4 subjects) , gastrointestinal hemorrhage  (3 subjects) , atrial flutter  (3 subjects), and 
pyrexia (3 subjects). 
Two deaths were reported during the Phase  2 Study SNFCT2015- 04; neither death (1  due to 
cardiogenic shock and 1 due to cardiopulmonary arrest subsequent to withdrawal from 
hemodialysis ) was consi dered related to SNF472 by the I nvestigator. In Study SNFCT2015 -05, 
death occurred in 7 subjects (4%) who received SNF472 and 5 subjects (6%) who received 
placebo ; 2 of t he deaths were cardiovascular (cardiac arrest in the 600 mg group and cardiac 
failure congestive in the placebo group); none were considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug . 
Overall, in clinical studies no clinically significant effects were reported in vital signs or 
laboratory values, including hypocalcemia. I n the open- label study ( SNFCT2015 -04), there were 
2 TEAEs of QT prolongation and 1 of tachycardia . One TEAE  of QT prolongation was considered 
not related. The other  event of QT prolon gation occurred 7 days after SNF472 infusion but was 
considered possibly related by the Investigator, and the event of tachycardia was considered 
possibly related by the Investigator. In the placebo -controlled study (SNFCT2015 -05) incidence 
of tachycardia was similar between SNF472 600 mg (4.4%) and placebo (3.3%); none of the tachycardia TEAEs were considered related by the Investigator. There was 1 TEAE of QT 
prolongation reported in the SNF472 300 mg group (1.1%) in SNFCT2015 -05 and considered 
possibly r elated by the Investigator.  
Based on the totality of nonclinical and clinical data generated to date, no  clinically relevant 
safety risks have been identified that preclude  continued human investigation with SNF472 .

 1.5 RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY 
Calciphylaxis is a life -threatening disease with a high mortality rate that mainly occurs in 
patients with ESRD receiving dialysis ( Section  1.1.1). As there are no  approved therapies for 
CUA ( Section  1.1.2) , there is an unmet need to improve the course of wounds and, ultimately, 
to improve CUA -related  outcomes for  patients. Thus, this Phase  3, double- blind, random ized, 
placebo- controlled study i s designed to assess the efficacy and safety  of SNF472 when added to 
background care  for the treatment of CUA  in subjects with ESRD receiving HD. The study 
hypothesis is that administration of SNF472 in addition to background care  over 12 weeks will 
impro ve wound healing , pain , and wound- related QoL compared to placebo . 
1.6 RISK -BENEFIT ASSESSM ENT 
Potential Benefits of Study Participation 
Benefits to individual subjects may include:  
• Receipt of a potentially efficacious treatment for calciphylaxis  
• Intensive monitoring of calciphylaxis wounds that may be more thorough and frequent 
than usually received through standard care outside of a clinical trial  
• Contribution to the development of a treatment for patients suffering from calciphylaxis  
Subjects treated with placebo during Part 1 of the study will receive SNF472 during Part 2. 
During Part 1, placebo -treated subjects may benefit from the closer follow -up and will continue 
to receive calciphylaxis background care.  
 
Risks from Study Participation 
In nonclinical  studies, transient hypocalcemia associated with some degree of QT prolongation 
was induced with rapid infusion of high concentration SNF472 but was not induced when the 
same concentration was administered via a slow infusion over 2 hours. Hypocalcemia and  
associated QT prolongation are  not expected in dialysis patients  since a dilute solution of 
SNF472 is infused slowly into the dialysis circuit with constant exposure to a standard calcium concentration gradient across the dialysis membrane. Indeed, no clinically significant trends in hypocalcemia or QT prolongation have been observed in either of the Phase 2 studies 
(SNFCT2015 -04 and SNFCT2015- 05). Those studies used comparable doses of SNF472 as in this  
study. Monitoring for changes in calcium and heart rhythm in the current study include pre - 
and post- dose collection of blood samples for measuring ionized calcium levels, pre- and post-
dose 12- lead ECGs, and continuous Holter monitoring over a 4 -4.5 hour window including the 
time of study drug infusion.  
Safety monitoring procedures described in the protocol are considered to be adequate to 
protect subject safety. In addition, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
will perform regular, periodic assessments of blinded and unblinded data to  detect any 
potential safety signals that may arise during the study and will advise the sponsor accordingly.

 COVID -19 Management  
During the global SARS- CoV-2 pandemic and without appropriate social distancing and personal 
protective equipment, there is a  potential for increased exposure to SARS -CoV- 2. Subjects are 
required to attend healthcare facilities for their hemodialysis sessions three times in a week 
during which they will receive study drug and undergo all study procedures. No separate or 
additional visit s outside of the subjects’ hemodialysis sessions are  expected. Clinical sites are to 
follow their SARS- CoV- 2 procedures and local guidelines to ensure an appropriate COVID -19 
prevention and protection strategy.  
Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion  
Calciphylaxis is a life -threatening disease with a high mortality rate that mainly occurs in 
patients with ESRD receiving dialysis. As there are no approved therapies for calciphylaxis, there 
is an unmet need to improve the course of wounds and, ultimately, to improve calciphylaxis -
related outcomes for patients. The totality of nonclinical and clinical data generated to date, 
including data from a 52 -week placebo -controlled  Phase 2 study (SNFCT2015 -05), support a 
favorable benefit/risk profile  for the study of SNF472 in this calciphylaxis population. Potential 
for additional risks will be monitored over the course of the trial and in the SNF472 clinical development program more broadly.   
More detailed information about the efficacy and safety profile of SNF472 is  provided in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.
 
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of this  study are: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of SNF472 compared with placebo when added to background care

background care  for the treatment of CUA  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 STUDY DESIGN OVERVIEW 
This Phase 3, global, multicenter study will include a screening period of up to 5 weeks 
(35 day s), a 12-week double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled period (Part  1) followed by 
a 12- week open -label treatment period (Part  2), and a 4 -week follow -up period.   
A study flow chart is provided in Figure 1.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 34 of 90 
 Screening Period:  
Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study procedures.  Subject eligibility 
will be evaluated during the screening period, which will be conducted as a two- step process . In 
addition, the subject’s pain medications should  be stabilized between Screening Visit 1 and 
Screening Visit 2  to determine the baseline  maintenance pain medication dose . Details of the 
screening process are provided in Section 5.1 
In addition to pain medications, other aspects of the background care regimen (including 
wound care, dialysis parameters, other concomitant medications relevant t o the management 
of CUA; Section 4.7.3) should be stabilized (or maintained if already stable) during the screening 
period .  
Completion of screening within 4 weeks or less is preferred but up to 5 weeks is allowed.  
Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 7  mg/kg 
of SNF472 or matching placebo in a double -blind manner. Randomization will be stratifie d 
based on intravenous STS use at the time of randomization (yes/no).  
Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo-C ontrolled Treatment Period (Part 1): Subjects will 
receive SNF472 or placebo for 12 weeks in addition to background care (in accordance with the 
clinic al practices of each site). No changes to the background care regimen, including pain 
medications,  should be made after randomization unless medically indicated in the opinion of 
the Investigator.   
The Schedule of Events for S creening Period and Part 1 is provided in Table 1. 
Open-L abel Treatment Period (Part 2): Subjects who complete Part 1 will be eligible to 
participate in Part 2, in which all subjects will receive open -label SNF472 for 12  weeks  and 
continue stable background care  (in accordance with the clinical practices of each site ), 
including pain medication, with no changes unless medically indicated  in the opinion of the 
Investigator .  
The Schedule of Events for Part 2 and the follow -up visit is provided in Table 2.  
Follow -Up Period / Early Termination : Subjects completing the study will return for a follow -up 
visit 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug . Subjects should continue  on stable background 
care during the 4 -week follow- up period, including pain medication,  with no changes unless 
medically indicated  in the opinion of the Investigator.  Subjects who discontinue study drug 
during Part 1 or Part 2 will be asked to complete study assessments throughout the respective 
part of the study (Part 1 or Part 2) and complete the follow -up visit. Subjects who discontinue 
study drug and are unwilling to complete the remaining study assessments will be encouraged to return for an early t ermination visit  4 weeks after the last dose of study drug . 
A subject is considered to have completed the study if the subject has completed all study visits, including the final follow -up visit.  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last study visit of the last subject in the study.

3.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN  
This Phase  3 study has been designed to assess the efficacy and safety of SNF472 for the 
treatment of CUA. Part 1 of the study will be conducted in a randomized, double -blind, p lacebo -
controlled  manner. All subjects will receive SNF472 in Part 2, giving subjects who received 
placebo in Part 1 the opportunity to receive the  active treatment , and generating a total of up 
to 24 weeks  of safety and efficacy data in those subjects who received SNF472 in Part 1 . 
The control therapy will be a matching placebo, rather tha n an active comparator,  because 
there are currently no approved medicinal products or devices for the treatment of this 
disease.  Subjects in both treatment groups  should  receive background care  for CUA in 
accordance with the clinical practices at each site , and this treatment should continue for the 
duration of the study, including during the follow -up period. Current background care  usually 
includes 1) reducing clinical factors that may exacerbate the deposition of calcium in vascular 
tissue, 2 ) wound care, and 3)  control of pain ( Goel et al, 2011 ; Seethapathy et al, 2019 ), and is 
described further in Section  1.1.2.  
The efficacy of SNF472 will be assessed using clinically  meaningful quantitative endpoints o f 
wound healing assessed by BWAT, pain  assessed by VAS, and quality of life  assessed with  the 
wou nd-related  QoL questionnaire . These endpoint assessments are described further in 
Section  5.6 and Section  3.3. Safety will be evaluated including assessment  of AEs,  laboratory 
parameters,  12-lead ECGs, Holter monitoring,  and vital signs.  
The 12- week duration of Part 1 was selected as appropriate for assessment of the primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints based upon data from the Phase 2 CUA Study SNFCT2015- 04. As 
summarized in Section  1.4.2, clinically and statistically significant improvements in wound 
healing, pain , and quality of life  were observed following 12  weeks of SNF472 treatment in that 
study. 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 36 of 90 
 The second part of the study  (Part 2 ) will be a 12-week open -label treatment period in which all 
subjects will receive SNF472. Thus, maximum exposure to SNF472 will be up to 24 weeks.  
Diagnosis of CUA will be made by the Investigator . A central wound rating group will review 
wound images to confirm the primary lesion is due to CUA.  No consensus has been established 
as to whether confirmation by biopsy is necessary for diagnosis of CUA and some experts 
believe it has a risk of inducing new lesions and infecti ous complications  (Brandenburg et al 
2016). Therefore, confirmation of CUA diagnosis by  skin biopsy is not required for inclusion in 
this trial. While e vidence of arteriolar calcif ication  from biopsy  is supportive of a CUA diagnosis 
its absence does not rule out CUA as findings are highly dependent upon sample quality and the 
location from which it is obtained. However, biopsies may be performed based on Investigator 
decision . 
3.3 APPROPRIATENESS OF A SSESSMENTS 
The primary and secondary efficacy assessments in this study (BWAT -CUA, Pain VAS, 
Wound- QoL, and BWAT total ) are well- characterized, as described below. BWAT total, Pain 
VAS, and Wound- QoL were pre- specified endpoint measures  in the Phase  2 study of SNF472 for 
the treatment of CUA (SNFCT2015 -04).  
BWAT total  and subsets of the BWAT have been widely used for measuring and predicting 
wound healing in clinical settings and have been used successfully in clinical studies of chroni c 
wounds, including pressure ulcers, diabetic ulcers, and venous leg ulcers ( e.g.,  Bellingeri et al, 
2016; Chan and Lai, 2014 ; Gupta et al, 2009 ). Content validity, concurrent validity, predictive 
validity, intra- rater reliability, and inter- rater reliability of the BWAT total  have been well 
documented ( Cauble, 2010 ; Bates -Jensen and Sussman 2011). The BWAT- CUA is a modification 
of BWAT which focuses on the prototypical features of CUA lesions and was developed with 
reference to the Phase 2 results. The BWAT -CUA was selected as a primary efficacy measure for 
Phase 3 to provide an objective, q uantitative CUA -focused tool that can be applied 
systematically across study sites to assess changes in CUA lesions over time.  
Both BWAT -CUA and BWAT total  showed statistically significant improvements in wound 
healing from baseline to Week 12 with SNF472 ( Section  1.4.2) in the Phase 2 study, 
demonstrating their suitability for evaluating improvement in wound healing over time in 
subjects with CUA. A  correlation between improvement in BWAT total and Pain VAS was also 
demonstrated in that study.  
The Pain VAS, a well- characterized self -assessment tool, has been shown to be a reliable 
method for measurement of pain intensity and responses to pain treatment ( Hawker et al, 
2011; Katz and Melzack, 1999 ; Swanson, 2014).  
The Wound- QoL questionnaire is a validated self -assessment tool that has been shown to be 
feasible f or assessing health -related QoL in patients with chronic wounds  (Augustin et al, 2014 ; 
Blome et al, 2014 ).

 Each kit will be given a unique code number, traceable to the batch number of the study drug s.  
4.2 DOSE R ATIONALE  
The dose of SNF472 for this study is 7  mg/kg, to be administered 3 times weekly (TIW) over  
approximately  2.5 – 3 hours at dialysis session s during the 2 treatment periods. This dose was 
selected  based on the results from the P hase 2 study in CUA ( Brandenburg et al, 2018 ) and 
supported by nonclinical toxicology and PK studies along with PK and PD  results from the Phase 
1 and 2 clinical studies  (SNFCT2012 -03, SNFCT2014- 03, and SNFCT2015- 04). 
Nonclinical data have shown that SNF472 is a potent and selective calcification inhibitor in vitro, 
in vivo, and in a biomarker assay that estimate s PD activity  by measuring inhibition of HAP 
crystallization ( Ferrer et al, 2017 ; Section  1.3). Efficacy of SNF472 was demonstrated between 2  
and 10  µM in animal  models, with a very steep dose -response relationship and a narrow range 
between initial evidence of efficacy a nd asymptotic maximal efficacy.  
The two Phase 1 clinical Studies SNFCT2012- 03 and  SNFCT2014- 03 evaluated single -dose and 
multiple -dose administration in subjects receiving HD ( Section  1.4). The single dose studied was 
9 mg/kg (720 mg/day  for an 80 -kg subject) and the multiple dose s range d from 1 to 20 mg/kg 
TIW for 1 week (up to 1600 mg/day for an 80- kg subject) and 10 mg/kg (800  mg/day for an 
80-kg subject) TIW for 1 month. The C max of SNF472 for  the 20  mg/kg dose was 101  µM at Day 1 
and 85  µM at Day 5, and showed no accumulation after repeat TIW dosing, consistent with the 
short SNF472 t 1/2 of approximately  30 to 60 minutes  (Section  1.4.1).  
The dose used in the Phase 2 CUA Study SNFCT2015- 04 was based on PK/PD and dose -PD 
relationships using a single direct -effect model based on the Hill approach ( Goutelle et al, 2008 ) 
or a sigmoid E max model, using the systemic exposure (C max and AUC) and dose s, respectively, 
from the Phase  1 Study SNFCT2014 -03. The dose of SNF472 administered at each session was 
400- 900 mg, based on body weight categories designed to have all subjects with an 
administe red dose close to 7 mg/kg. The actual range of doses administered was 5.6 -8.6 mg/kg.  
The mean (± standard deviation [ SD]) Cmax in Study SNFCT2015 -04 was 29.1 ± 19.1  µM and 
28.1 ± 21.0 µM at Week s 1 and 12, respectively. The mean (± SD) PD effect was 65% ± 14 % and 
60% ± 29% inhibition at Weeks  1 and 12, respectively.  No dose -PD correlation  was apparent 
because the lowest dose of 5.6 mg/kg  provided a maximal PD response, and higher doses were 
within the plateau of the PD  response  observed in the previous cl inical studies . 
The dose of 7 mg/kg (e.g.,  560 mg/day in an 80 -kg subject) was selected  for this Phase  3 study 
based on the following considerations:  
• This dose is expected to provide maximal inhibition of calcification based on dose -PD 
analyses from the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies . 
• The pharmacological response shows a very narrow window between no activity and 
maximal activity.  
• There is no accumulation of the compound after repeat TIW dosing; therefore, estimations 
of plasma concentrations expected for ce rtain doses performed from 1 - and 3 -month 
clinical studies should also apply for a treatment duration of 6 months.

  Page 40 of 90 
 • SNF472 will be administered via IV infusion directly into the dialysis tubing, the same method 
used  in the Phase 2 CUA  Study SNFCT2015- 04. 
• This dose provides adequate safety margins of systemic exposure in tox icology studies 
conducted in nonclinical species.  
4.3 TREATMENT A SSIGNMENT  
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to either 7 mg/kg SNF472 or placebo. 
Randomizat ion will be stratified based on intravenous STS use (yes/no ) at the time of 
randomization .  
Randomiz ation  will occur at Screening Visit 2 which may occur up to one week prior to the start 
of dosing  on Week 1 Day 1  and wil l be performed using a centraliz ed electro nic rand omiz ation 
system  that is part of the Interactive Response Technology  (IRT). 
In Part 2, all subjects will receive open -label 7 mg/kg SNF472.  
4.4 BLINDING, PACKAGING, AND LABELING  
4.4.1 Blinding  
Part 1 will be performed in a double -blind manner . Part 2 will be open label . The Investigator, 
site staff, subjects , and Sponsor staff (including designee s) involved in the conduct of the study 
and data management  will remain blinded to the treatment assignment for Part 1 for the 
duration of the study including Part 2 and follow -up until the study database is locked , except 
as described in Section  4.4.2.  
To maintain the blinded nature of Part 1 of t he study, the SNF472 and matching  placebo 
treatments will be identical in appearance , and the volume of solution administered to subjects 
in both treatment groups will be based on body weight.  
4.4.2 Unblinding  
The study blind for Part 1 should not be broken except in a medical emergency (where 
knowledge of the study drug administered would affect the treatment of the emergency) or 
regulatory requirement  (e.g.,  for SAEs).   
The decision to break the blind can only be made by the Investigator , or other persons duly 
registered in the clinical trial file as sub -Investigator s. If possible, the Investigator should consult 
with the Medical M onitor  prior to breaking the blind. Unblinded staff members will not convey 
information regarding treatment  assignments in the study , whether informally or formally, to 
any other person, unless required for medical reasons. If the blind is broken, the date, time , and 
reason must be recorded and included in any associated AE  report. 
If an emergency unblinding becomes necessary, the Investigator should request the unblinding 
information through the centralized electronic randomization system and notify the 
Sponsor/ Medical Monitor of the  unblinding .

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 41 of 90 
 The ethics committee should be informed if a subject’s treatment is unblinded at the site level. 
After the unblinding the Investigator shall determine if the subject is to continue or discontinue study drug. The Investig ator’s decision  should be based on the risk to benefit determination for 
the subject and should be discussed with the medical monitor prior to implementing the 
decision when possible . The Sponsor should be informed of the decision.  
4.4.3 Packaging, Labelling,  and Storage  
The study drugs will be labelled according to the applicable local health authority and/or 
regulatory  requirements. Study drugs  will be sent to the central or local depots and the depots 
will then send the study drugs to the s tudy si te. Study drug shipments will be under refrigerated 
conditions. 
All supplies of study drug  must be stored under refrigeration  at the sites . The Sponsor should be 
notified of any significant study drug temperature excursions.  
4.5 ADMINISTRATION OF STUDY DRUG  
Preparation of study drug for administration will be done by trained and qualified technicians 
or pharmacists. Detailed instructions on preparation of the study drug for administration will be 
provided in the Pharmacy Manual .  
The study drug  should be administered TIW in conjunction with the subject’s dialysis sessions.  If 
subjects have dialysis sessions more than 3  times per week, the study drug will only be 
administered TIW according to the schedule of events outlined in Table 1 and Table 2.  
In Part 1,  the dose of blinded study drug will be based on the subject’s body weight recorded 
after hemodialysis during  screening . In Part 2, the dose of SNF472 will be based on the subject’s 
body weight recorded after hemo dialysis at  Week  12, Day 5  of Part  1. 
The appropriate volume of the study drug will be removed from the vial and then diluted in 
physiological saline and administered as a constant rate IV infusion with an infusion pump 
connected directly to the dialysis machine before  the dialyzer via an IV infusion set, as shown in 
Figure  2. The preparation of study drug and the infusion procedure will be described in the 
Pharmacy Manual. The study drug should NOT  be administered by bolus or directly into the 
vein . The study drug should ALWAYS  be administered via the dialysis tubing  before the dialyzer . 
The infusion should begin just  after the start of the HD procedure and should be administered 
over a period of approximately 2.5 – 3 hours . The total dose should be delivered at each dosing 
session, even in the event of infusion interruptions that may extend the dosing duration.  
No direct  interactions are expected between SNF472 and STS , however no studies have been 
conducted to evaluate administration of the two drugs together, thus SNF472 should NOT be adm inistered concomitantly with STS. In the event that both drugs need to be administered to 
the subject, the administration of  STS should occur after administration of SNF472 during the  
last 30  minutes of the HD session.  
Investigators should consider whether any changes to the dialysis prescription will be needed to 
account for the volume of saline used for delivery of the study drug and track the weight of 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 42 of 90 
 subjects after hemodialysis ( as per usual practice ), adjusting dialysis settings if needed for 
maintaining volume balance.  
 
For each study drug infusion, the site will document the actual start and stop times of the 
infusion, the total  volume infused, and any interruption and resumption of the infusion along 
with the reason for the interruption.  
Figure  2. Method of Study Drug Administration 
 
 
 Note: SNF472 is not removed by dialysis and the diluted study drug should be added to the 
dialysis line before the dialyzer . 
4.6 SUPPLIES AND ACCOUNT ABILITY  
The Investigator  or designee is responsible for maintaining accurate accountability records of 
the study drug vials throughout the clinical study.  
Cumulative inventory and dispensing of study drug will be recorded throughout the study using 
the centralized electronic system and electronic data capture ( EDC).  

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 43 of 90 
 All sites will return unused study drug vials to the depot. Broken or damaged vials will be 
destroyed on- site following the site’s Drug Destruction Policy  and accounted for within the drug 
accountability records . The unused study drug  return for destruction will only occur after drug 
accountability has been performed, after any discrepancies have been resolved , and after 
receiving approval of destruction  by the Sponsor or designee . 
4.7 PRIOR AND CONCOMITAN T MEDICATIONS , BACKGROUND  CARE FOR  CUA , 
WOUND CARE, DIALYSIS PARAMETERS , AND LIFES TYLE RESTRICTIONS  
4.7.1 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
• Bisphosphonates should not be used within 3 months prior to baseline  (Week 1 Day 1) 
or at any  time throughout the study .  
• Intralesional STS treatment of the wound should not be used from the time of 
randomization or at any time throughout the study . 
4.7.2 All Prior and Concomitant Medications  
The use of any other treatments or medication s considered necessary by the Investigator for 
management of the subject’s health and medical condition are allowed during this study.  
At screening, medications taken during  the past 30  days will be recorded as prior medications in 
the eCRF  (including dose, duration, and reason for administration) .  
New medications and/or changes in ongoing prior medications relative to screening will be 
documented before the first dose of study drug  on Week 1 Day 1 . 
After the first dose of study drug , new medications and/or  changes to ongoing  medications, 
including pain medications, will be recorded as concomitant medication s in the eCRF  with 
details including but not limited to dose, duration, and reason for administration  according to 
the schedule in Table 1 and Table 2. 
4.7.3 Background Care for CUA  
All subjects should receive background care  for CUA in accordance with the clinical practices at 
each site. Background care includes wound care, dialysis parameters (calcium concentration in 
the dialysate, dialysis frequency and duration), pain medications, and other concomitant medications relevant to the management of CUA.  A stable background care regimen should be 
established (or maintained if already in place) during the screening period  and should continue 
throughout Parts 1 and 2 and the follow- up period. Additional information on stabilizing pain 
medications is provided in Section 4.7.3.1 . After the screening period, no changes to the 
background care regimen, including the maintenance pain medication dose, should be made 
during the study  unless medically indicated  in the opinion of the Investigator.   
Consideration should be given to potential triggers for CUA and I nvestigators should consider 
whether these measures are appropriate for their subjects: replacement of warfarin with another anticoagulant, withdrawal of calcium- based  phosphate binders unless being used for 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 44 of 90 
 hypocalcemia, reduction in vitamin D administration, and a hemodialysis regimen  of 4 hours, 
three times per week. Wounds should be monitored regularly for infection.  
4.7.3.1  Stabilizing Pain Medications  
The site staff should establish  (or maintain if already in place)  a stable pain medication regimen 
between Screening Visit 1 and Screening Visit 2 .  
At Screening Visit 1, the site staff will assess and record the details of all pain medications the 
subject is currently using to control pain for CUA and other reasons . Pain medications used for 
the prior 30 days will be included in the eCRF. The subject should be provided with a diary at 
Screening Visit 1 and instructed to record all use of pain medications (opioids and non -opioids ) 
on a daily basis, in dicating if the pain medication was for CUA lesion pain or pain  from other 
causes . Subjects will be asked to record all pain medications they are currently taking and  any 
newly prescribed pain medications taken during the s creening  period . Subjects should be 
instructed to bring the diary with them to the site at each visit.  The site staff should review the 
diary with subjects at least weekly during the screening period  and clarify, as needed, 
medications used, frequency, and dosage. Actual use from the diaries will be recorded by site 
staff in the  eCRF.  The Investigator or designee  will evaluate pain medication stabilization 
beginning at Screening Visit 1  and on a weekly basis until Screening Visit 2 .  
The stable dose of pain  medication  used for CUA will be based on the  subject’s usage during a 
7-day period prior to Screening Visit 2 . A 2-week period of evaluation is suggested, but this 
duration may require less time or more time, up to three to four weeks , based on the needs of 
the subject. The week used for determining the stable dose should not be a week during which 
additional but short- term use of opioids was required during or due to medical procedures 
(e.g.,  surgical debridement, fistula procedures). If such additional opioid use occurred, the 
7 days prior to the procedure or the 7 days after the procedure should be used to determine 
the stable dose. Note: Up to 5 weeks for screening is permitted, but the screening period may 
be shorter for some subjec ts.  
When a stable dose has been determined, it be  will be defined as the subject’s maintenance  
dose for the remainder of the trial . The maintenance opioid dose will be calculated centrally as  
the average daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME) based on the information entered in 
the e CRF.  
4.7.3.2  Maintenance of Pain Management During the Trial  
Subjects will continue to record all pain medications taken in the diary on a daily basis 
throughout the trial  and the site staff will continue to review the diary with subjects weekly and 
record actual pain medications used in the e CRFs.  
Investigators should continue the prescriptions for pain medications established during the screening period  as the baseline maintenance dose . If applicable, Investigators should 
coordinate with other providers involved in pain management for the subject and encourage 
them not to change pain medication unless medically indicated for worsening of pain control . 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 45 of 90 
 Also, Investigators should request the provider to inform them of any change in dose or 
addition of new pain medications.  
The following general guidance for pain management during the study, based on pain severity , 
should be followed:  
• Mild pain should be treated with acetaminophen and adjuvants such as pregabalin or 
gabapentin.  
• If this combination is inadequate for pain control, addition of a low dose opiate such as oxycodone should be considered.  
• Only if further pain control is required, use of higher doses and/or stronger opiates ( e.g.,  
fentanyl patch) should be considered, up to a maximally tolerated dose.  
• If pain is not controlled despite this guidance, Investigators may follow regional or institution guidelines for management of pain.  
4.7.3.3  CUA Wound Care  
CUA w ound care will be at the discretion of the treating physician but should avoid agents 
known to inhibit healing such as liquid povidone iodine and hydrogen peroxide. Surgical debridement may be considered , if necessary, to prevent systemic infection. Wound care 
received for CUA lesions will be recorded periodically according to the schedule in Table 1 and 
Table 2. CUA w ound care recorded can  include:  
• Absorptive dressing (gauze, alginate)  
• Impregnated, non- adherent gauze  
• Gel dressing 
• Cream/ointment therapy  
• Enzymatic debridement  
• Surgical debridement  
• Negative pressure therapy  
• Hyperbaric oxygen  
• Other (specify) 
4.7.3.4  Dialysis Parameters  
Sites will be requested to record calcium concentration in the dialysate, the frequency and 
duration of dialysis,  and record dialysis adequacy (Kt/V or URR) at each of the visits indicated in 
Table 1 and Table 2. Estimated values from the dialysis machine or calculated values using local 
lab measurements may be used. For each subject, the same measure of dialysis adequacy (Kt/V or URR) should be reco rded at the visits indicated and it should be based on the same data 
source (dialysis machine or calculation using local labs)  throughout the study .

 4.7.4 Lifestyle Restrictions  
4.7.4.1  Dietary Restrictions  
No dietary restrictions are required for participation in this  study. In addition, no restrictions on 
the timing of food or fluid intake with respect to dosing are required because the study drug  
administration will be IV . 
4.7.4.2  Contraception Requirements  
To prevent pregnancy , female subjects and female partners of male  subjects , must not be of 
child bearing potential  (i.e., menopausal for >1 year , surgically sterilized ), must practice true 
abstinence , or must practice one of the  highly effective contraceptive method s (i.e., results in 
<1% failure rate when used consistently and correctly) listed below from screening through 
30 days after the last dose  of study drug . True abstinence is defined as abstinence that is part of 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post- ovulation methods)  and declaration of abstinence for the duration of 
exposure to study drug  are not acceptable.  Withdrawal is also  not an acceptable method of 
contraception. 
• Female subjects of childbearing potential  who are sexually active  should use one of the 
following contraceptive methods:  
o Intrauterine device or intrauterine system in place for at least 3  months prior to first 
dose of study drug  
o Partner has had a vasectomy  
 Note: Vasectomy  in the partner is only considered to be highly effective provided 
the partner is the sole sexual partner of the female subject of childbearing 
potential and the vasectomized partner has had a medical assessment of the surgical success.  
o Stable hormonal con traception associated with inhibition of ovulation ( such as oral, 
transdermal, or depot regimen) for at least 3  months prior to first dose of study drug  
o Bilateral tubal ligation  
• Male subjects who are sexually active  and have a partner who is of childbearin g potential 
should use a condom in addition to having their female partner use another acceptable method (see bullet point above)  from screening through 30 days after the last dose of study 
drug. 
o Note: Male subjects must not have unprotected sexual intercourse with a female who 
is pregnant or breastfeeding during the study.

 5 STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS 
5.1 SCREENING P ERIOD  
The schedule of assessments during the S creening Period is provided in Table  1. 
Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study procedures. Screening will be 
conducted in two steps (Screening Visit 1 and Screening Visit 2).  
Screening Visit 1:  
At Screening Visit 1, the study staff should initiate the screen ing process by evaluating the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, collecting the CUA lesion images  (photographs and videos) , 
demographic information (sex, age, race , ethnicity ), prior/concomitant medications , including 
pain medication use , dialysis parameters, medical history, physical exam (including weight and 
height), and vital signs .  
As the initial step during the screening process, the site personnel will complete and enter demographic information into the IRT system, acquire images of the subject’s suspected CUA 
lesion (s) and will rate undermining, peripheral tissue edema, and peripheral tissue induration 
for these lesion (s). In addition, the site personnel will administer the Pain VAS pain and Wound 
QoL. The central wound rating group will confirm whether lesion (s) are due to CUA  (according 
to details provided in the Central Wound Rating Charter ). The subject should be provided with a 
pain medication diary and instructed to  record on a daily basis  all pain medications (opioids and 
non-opioids ) taken and the reason the pain medications were taken ( i.e., for CUA lesion pain or 
other non- CUA lesion pain ).  
Site personnel will be notified through the IRT system that the subject’s  lesion(s) and Pain VAS 
score have  met eligibility requirements . Site staff can then continue to complete the remaining 
eligibility requirements (laboratory specimen collection, completion of medical history , and 
other evaluations ).  
During the subsequent week(s) prior to Screening Visit 2, the Investigator or designee should 
review the subject diary with the subject at least weekly, record actual pain medication use in 
the eCRF , and titrate the pain medications  as needed (see Section 4.7.3.1 for additional details) 
until a stable pain medication regimen is achieved . When a stable dose is achieved , it be will be 
defined as the subject’s pain maintenance dose  for the remainder of the trial.  
In addition to pain medications, other aspects of the background care regimen (including wound care, dialysis parameters, other concomitant medications relevant to the management of CUA; Section 4.7.3) should be stabilized  (or maintained if already stable) and recorded .  
Screening Visit 2 
At Screening Visit 2, the  CUA lesion s identified at Screening Visit 1 and confirmed as CUA lesions 
by the central wound rating  group, will be evaluated for significant improvement , based on the 
opinion of the Investigator, since the initial assessment . If the CUA lesion has not significantly 
improved , in the opinion of the investigator, any incomplete eligibility criteria should be 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 48 of 90 
 completed , including Holter monitoring and local ECGs. Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria 
will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 7  mg/kg of SNF472 or matching placebo . 
A subject who does not meet all of the eligibility criteria will be screen failed. Subjects who 
have failed screening may be rescreened  on a case -by-case basis after discussion with the 
Medical Monitor . 
Due to visit scheduling , a subject’s Week 1 Day 1 visit may oc cur up to 7 days after 
randomization. If during this period and prior to the administration of the first dose of study 
drug the  Investigator observes c hanges to the primary lesion (e.g., significant improvement  
from screening) or changes to the subject’s clinical condition  which may make the subject 
ineligible, the Medical Monitor should be consulted.   
5.2 PART 1: DOUBLE-B LIND, RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO -CONTROLLED TREATMENT  
PERIOD  
The schedule of assessments during Part 1 is provided in Table  1. 
Subjects will receive SNF472 or placebo for 12 weeks in addition to background care (in 
accordance with the clinical practices of each site). No changes to the background care 
regimen , including pain maintenance dose, should be made after randomization unless 
medically indicated in the opinion of the Investigator. Medically indicated changes to background care will be recorded on the eCRF . 
In Part 1, s ubjects should continue to record all pain medications taken in the pain medication 
diary and bring their diary with them to each visit. Diaries should be reviewed with the subject 
at least weekly and pain medications will be recorded in the eCRF.  
5.3 PART 2: OPEN -LABEL TREATMENT PERIOD  
The schedule of assessments during Part 2 is provided in Table 2. 
Subjects who complete Part 1 will be eligible to participate in Part 2, in which all subjects will receive open -label SNF472 for 12  weeks and continue stable background care  (in accordance 
with the clinical practices of each site ), including pain maintenance dose, with no changes 
unless medically indicated  in the opinion of the I nvestigator. Medically indicated changes to 
background care will be recorded on the eCRF . 
In Part 2, s ubjects should continue to record all pain medications taken in the pain medication 
diary and bring their diary with them to each visit. Diaries should be reviewed with the subject 
at least weekly and pain medications will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If a visit is missed  in Part 1 or Part 2,  subjects should return to the normal schedule after the 
missed visit.  Missed assessments should be conducted at the next  visit.  
5.4 FOLLOW -UP PERIOD/ EA RLY TERMINATION  
The schedule of assessments for the Follow -Up/ Early Termination is provided in Table 2. 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 49 of 90 
 Subjects completing the study will return for a follow- up visit 4 weeks after the last dose of 
study drug. Subjects should continue  on stable background care during the 4 -week follow-up 
period  with no changes unless medically indicated  in the opinion of the Investigator.  Subjects 
who discontinue study drug during Part 1 or Part 2 will be asked to complete study assessments 
throughout the respective part of the study (Part 1 or Part 2) and complete a follow- up visit. 
Subjects who discontinue study drug and are unwilling to complete the remaining study 
assessments should be encouraged to return for  an early t ermination visit 4 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug . Additional information on early discontinuation of study drug and 
withdrawal from the study is provided in Section 7.  
In the follow- up period, subjects should continue to record all pain medications taken in the 
pain medication diary and bring their diary with them to each visit. Diaries should be reviewed 
with the subject at least weekly and pain medications will be recorded in the eCRF.  
5.5 ORDER OF ASSESSMENTS  
5.5.1 Prior to Start of Dialysis  
The following should be performed prior to the start of dialysis and the  following order is 
recommended:  
1. Pain VAS 
2. Wound QoL questionnaire  
3. BWAT  and image  (photos and video) collection  
4. Placement of the Holter monitor and initiat ion of  recording with H olter monitor prior to 
dialysis  
5.5.2 During Dialysis  
When more than one of the following assessment s is conducted at the same time point, they 
should be performed in the following or der: 
1. Perform  local ECG s (see Section 5.8.5 for time points)  
2. Blood sampling for ionized calcium and safety labs 
3. Blood sampling for biomarkers, PD, and PK  
Data will be recorded in  an eCRF implemented in an  appropriate EDC system, as des cribed in 
Section  9.2. 
5.6 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
5.6.1 Wound Evaluation  
Using a standardized device and imaging software, images ( photos and videos ) of CUA lesions 
will be acquired  and stored, according to details provided in the Site Imaging and BWAT Manual 
at the visits specified in Table 1 and Table 2. The course of the lesion (s) will be assessed 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 50 of 90 
 quantitatively with BWAT (Section  5.6.1.1) and with qualitative image review  (Section  5.6.1.2). 
If a subject has more than one CUA lesion, the course of up to 3 lesions (primary, secondary, 
tertiary) will be assessed. Which lesions are primary, secondary, and tertiary will be defined 
based on the total area as measured by the wound imaging software a t screening. In addition, 
occurrence of new CUA  lesions will be monitored ( Section  5.6.1.3).  
The central wound rating group will review image quality and notify the site if wound imaging 
needs to be repeated at a following visit  for a technical reason . 
5.6.1.1  Quantitative Wound Evaluation with BWAT  and BWAT -CUA  
The BWAT  (APPENDIX 1 ; Bates -Jensen and Sussman, 2011 ) is a standardized tool for 
quantitative assessment of wound healing  that includes evaluation of these 13 item s:  
• Size 
• Depth 
• Edges  
• Undermining  
• Necrotic tissue type  
• Necrotic tissue amount 
• Exudate type  
• Exudate amount  
• Skin color surrounding wound  
• Peripheral tissue edema  
• Peripheral tissue induration  
• Granulation tissue  
• Epithelialization  
Each item  is rated on a scale of 0 or 1 (best) to 5 (worst). Two scores will be calculated as 
endpoints for this study, BWAT total and BWAT -CUA. BWAT total is the sum of all 13 item s with 
a possible range of scores from 9 to 65. In addition, a targeted modification  of BWAT, the 
BWAT -CUA, will be calculated which focuses on the following prototypical features of CUA 
lesions: necrotic tissue type, necrotic tissue amount, exudate type, exudate amount, skin color surrounding wound, peripheral tissue edema, peripheral tissue induration, and granulation 
tissue. The possible range of scores for BWAT -CUA is 8  to 40. 
Two additional items are collected in BWAT, location and shape, but do not contribute to the 
scoring.  
Site personnel will be trained and responsible for obtaining quality  wound photographs and 
videos with the provided device  and imaging software, along with scoring undermining, 
peripheral tissue edema, and peripheral tissue induration, a ccording to the procedures 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 51 of 90 
 described in the Site Imaging and BWAT Manual. Ever y effort should be made for the same 
person at the site to perform evaluation of these items at all visits for each subject . As with all 
other study personnel, the central wound rating group will be blinded to treatment assignment. 
The central raters will review the site’s ratings and will rate the remaining BWAT items based 
upon review of the photographs and videos. Rating of the size item will be aided by automated 
measurements from the imaging software. The scoring procedure will be described in detail in the Central Wound Rating Charter.  
 
5.6.1.2  Qualit ative Wound Evaluation  
The central wound rating group will perform a qualitative review of the baseline  (Week 1 Day 1) 
and Week 12  images of the primary lesion after the completion of the Week 12 visit. The Week 
12 wound will be assigned to one of the following categories:  
o Worsened from baseline  
o Equal to baseline  
o Improved from baseline  
A similar qualitative comparison will be made between Week 12 and Week 24 images  of the 
primary lesion after the completion of the Week 24 visit . 
Qualitative reviewers will not be involved in confirmation of CUA lesions or BWAT rating during 
the trial. In addition to being blinded to treatment assignment in Part 1 , the qualitative 
reviewers will be blinded to the order of study visits in both Part 1 and 2.  The review procedure 
is described in detail in the Central Wound Rating Charter.  
5.6.1.3  New CUA Lesions  
Occurrence of new CUA lesions since baseline (Week 1 Day 1)  will be monitored periodically as 
specified in Table 1 and Table  2 to assess overall lesion burden. The site will collect images of 
the suspected CUA lesion(s) that were not present at baseline and the central wound rating group  will review the images (according to the procedure described in Central Wound Rating 
Charter) to determine whether the new lesion is a CUA lesion.  BWAT -CUA and BWAT total will 
not be scored for the new CUA lesions.  
5.6.2 Pain VAS 
The Pain VAS  will be used to assess the level of CUA wound-related pain  experienced by the 
subject in reference to all of the subject’s lesions . A VAS is a n instrument that aims to measure 
a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured.  
Pain VAS will be electronically administered, requiring the subject to mark a position anywhe re 
on a 10-cm ( 100- mm) long horizontal line  to indicate the worst  wound- related pain  experienced 
during the previous  24 hours . From this mark, the VAS score will be electronically recorded in 
mm based on measurement along the line . The VAS line will be anchored by the word 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 52 of 90 
 descriptors at each end of “no pain” and “worst possible pain” . An example of a Pain VAS is 
illustrated in Figure  3. 
Figu re 3. Pain Visual Analog Scale  
 
5.6.3 Wound- QoL 
The Wound- QoL questionnaire, provided in APPENDIX 2, measures the disease -specific, 
health- related QoL of patients with chronic wounds. It consists of 17 items on impairments that 
are assessed in reference to the preceding 7  days. Each rated on a  5-point Likert scale with 
responses ranging from “not at all”  (0) to “very much” (4).  
The Wound- QoL will be electronically administered.  The global score and subscale scores will 
be calculated programmatically in acc ordance with the scoring rules.  
5.6.4 Pain Me dications  
Subjects will record all pain medications used in a daily  pain medication  diary. Site staff will 
review the diary with subjects at least weekly and record actual pain medications used in the 
eCRFs.  
 
5.7 PHARMACODYNAMICS, PHARMACOKINETICS , AND BIOMARKER ASSESSMENT S 
Blood samples for PD, PK, and biomarker analyses must be collected on a dialysis day when study drug dosing occurs . Samples will be obtained from the dialysis port and should be either 
stored in a -80°C (±10°C) freezer prior to shipme nt or  be shipped on dry ice on the same day as 
collection . Samples for PK, PD, and biomarker analyses will be collected pre-dose  and within 
20 minutes prior to the end of infusion (EOI) at Weeks 1, 12, 13, and 24. For the follow -up/early 
termination visit,  the biomarker sample should be collected prior to the start of dialysis .  
Collection (including sample volumes), storage, and handling of blood samples for PD, PK, and 
biomarker analyses will be detailed in the Laboratory Manual.  
The PD, PK, and biomarker analyses summarized  in Section s 5.7.1,  5.7.2, and 5.7.3, respectively, 
will be performed at central laboratories.

 5.7.1 Pharmacodynamics  
The PD of SNF472 will be assessed in pre- dose  and EOI samples by an in vitro method to 
determine the propensity for HAP crystal formation in plasma.  
5.7.2 Pharmacokinetics  
The plasma concentration of SNF472 will be determined in pre- dose  and EOI samples.  The EOI 
sample corresponds to Cmax. 
5.7.3 Biomarkers 
The following biomarkers will be assessed in pre- dose  and EOI samples : fetuin A, intact 
fibroblast growth factor 23 (iFGF23),  c-terminal fibroblast growth factor 23 (c -FGF23),  matrix gla 
protein (MGP), sclerostin, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) , tartrate -resistant acid 
phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b), bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway 
inhibitor 1 (DKK1), osteocalcin, osteoprogeterin, osteopontin, bone morphogenetic protein- 9 
(BMP- 9), iron, ferritin, and transferrin, and lipids  (LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides) . 
Biomarker testing may include RNA measurements. No DNA testing will be performed .  
5.8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
The safety assessments described in this section will be performed at the visits specified in Table 1 and Table 2. 
5.8.1 Adverse Events  
The assessment and reporting of A Es are discussed in detail in Section  6. 
5.8.2 Medical History  
The subject’s relevant medical history will be recorded  at scree ning. Previous illnesses and 
history of drug and alcohol abuse will be recorded. Medical history will be updated prior to the 
first day of dosing in Part 1.  
5.8.3 Physical E xamination and Body Weight 
The physical examination  will include an examination of general appearance, skin, head and 
neck, chest, lungs, heart, abdomen, extremities and basic nervous system evaluation. If any physical findings are abnormal, the I nvestigator must docume nt the abnormality as 
nonclinically significant  (NCS) or clinically significant  (CS). Subsequent to the screening 
examination, any abnormality assessed as ‘CS’ must be recorded as an AE if not explained by a coexisting condition (documented in the medical hi story).  
Physical examinations will include b ody weight which will be recorded post -dialysis , without 
shoes. If body weight cannot be assessed without shoes, then it should be assessed under the 
same conditions throughout the study.  Height will be included in the physical examination at 
screening only.

 5.8.4 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures , respiratory rate, and body 
temperature ) will be assessed post -dialysis after the subject has been sitting for 5 min utes. The 
results of these protocol -specified assessments will be recorded in the eCRF; however, 
additional v ital signs assessments taken as part of background care  do not need to be recorded. 
5.8.5 Holter Mon itoring and Electrocardiograms  
Holter monitoring and local ECGs  must be completed on dialysis days  and, with the exception of 
screening visits, only on a day when the study drug is administered.  Holter monitoring  during 
dialysis will be performed  as part of Screening Visit 2 ( may be conducted at any dialysis session 
during the last week of screening prior to Week 1 Day 1 ), and at Weeks 1, 6, 12 , 13, and 24 . The 
Holter monitor will be placed on the subject and the recording started prior to the beginning of 
dialysis  (at least 30 minutes)  and continue to the end of dialysis .  
Holter instruction and timing are summarized in Table 4. Refer to the Holter and ECG Manual 
for additional details and procedures .

monitor  and will be assessed for abnormalities by the Investigator. The Screening Visit  2 ECGs 
should be recorded at the start of dialysis and 2.5 hours after the start of dialysis and may be 
conducted at any dialysis session during the last week of screening prior to Week 1 Day 1 . Local 
ECGs  should be  obtained pre- dose  and within 20 minutes prior to EOI at  Weeks 1, 12, 13, and 
24. Abnormalities the Investigator judges to be  clinically significant should be recorded as 
adverse events.  These ECGs should be considered source documentation and be included as 
part of the subject’s chart.  
Local ECG collection timepoints are summarized in Table 5. For additional details on local ECG 
procedures r efer to the Holter  and ECG Manual .

6 ADVERSE EVENTS  
6.1 DEFINITIONS  
6.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is defined by the ICH  Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) as any untoward 
medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
A treatment- emergent AE is defined as an AE that begins or that worsens in severity after at 
least one dose of the study drug  has been administered.  
Surgical procedures or laboratory values themselves are not AEs . Surgical procedures  are 
therapeutic measures for conditions that require surgery . Abnormal laboratory values may lead 
to diagnosis of a  condition. The condition for which the surgery or lab oratory  value is indica tive 
of is an AE  if it occurs or is detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures and the 
condition(s) leading to these measures are not AEs  if the condition(s) was (were) known before 
the period of observation. In the latter case the condition should be reported as medical 
history. 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 57 of 90 
 6.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is an AE  that at any dose (including overdose)  that meets at least one of the following 
criteria: 
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening ( i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the SAE; it 
does not refer to a SAE that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospital ization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ( i.e., a hospital 
inpatient admission or prolongation of hospital stay was required for the treatment of the 
AE, or that one or the other occurred as a consequence of the event)  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  (i.e., a permanent or significant and 
subs tantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions)  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event (I f an AE doesn’t meet one of the criteria above, but the 
Investigator considers the event to be clinically important, then the event could be classified as an SAE under the criterion of ‘important medical event’. Examples of such medical events may include bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias , or convulsion s that don’t result in inpatient hospitalization.)  
6.1.3 Wound- Related Complications  
Each adverse event will be assessed as CUA wound- related or not CUA wound- related by the 
Investigator or designee.  
6.1.4 Adverse Event by Severity or Intensity  
Assessment of severity of an AE will be rated  by the Investigator or designee  according to the 
criteria in  Table 7. 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 58 of 90 
 Table 7. Definitions of Adverse Events Severity  Based on CTCAE  
Grade 1 (Mild) Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 (Moderate)  Moderate; minimal, local , or non invasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental ADL1. 
Grade 3 (Severe)  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospital ization  or prolongation of hospital ization  indicated ; disabling; 
limiting self -care ADL2 
Grade 4 (Life -
Threatening)  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 (Fatal)  Death related to AE  
ADL = activities of daily living; CTCAE = Common Terminology C riteria for Adverse Events.  
1 Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
2 Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing  and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden . 
It is important to note that severity and seriousness are separate characteristics of an AE: 
severity denotes the intensity of the AE ( Table 7), whereas seriousness is an AE categorization 
based on the criteria listed in Section  6.1.2  that denotes whether expedited reporting is 
required for an AE (see Section  6.3.1.2 and Section  6.3.2).  
Any AE with a severity of Grade 4 or 5 would meet the criteria for seriousness . A Grade 3 AE 
may or may not meet the criteria for seriousness depending upon whether any of the other criteria for seriousness in Section  6.1.2 are met.  
6.1.5 Relationship between Adverse Events and Study Drug  
The relationship between all AEs and the study drug must be assessed the Investigator or 
clinician designee based on the temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgement  using the 
guidelines in Table 8. In addition to a temporal relationship, the Investigator should consider 
the following when determining the relationship between an AE and study drug: whether an alternative etiology has been identified, mechanism of action of the study drug , and/or the 
biological plausibility of a relationship.  

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 59 of 90 
 Table 8. Guidelines for Assessing the Potential Relationship Between Adverse Event and the 
Study Drug  
Related  This causal relationship is assigned if the AE is known to occur with the 
study drug , there is a reasonable possibility that the study drug  caused 
the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between study drug  
administration and the event. Reasonable possibility means that there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug  
and the AE.  
Not Related  This causal relationship is assigned when there is not a reasonable 
possibility that the administration of the study drug  caused the event, 
there is no temporal relationship between the study drug  
administration and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been 
established. 
 
6.1.6 Adverse Event Outcome  
If the same AE occurs more than one time  in the same subject, then the AE in question must be 
documented and assessed as a new event each time, unless the AE is considered to be a 
continuation of the previously reported event rather than a reoccurrence of the event.  
The AE outcome will be recorded as defined in Table 9. 
Table 9. Adverse Event Outcome  
Not recovered/not resolved  - One of the possible results of an AE outcome that indicates 
that the event has not improved or recuperated.  
Recovered/resolved  - One of the possible results of an AE outcome that indicates that the 
event has improved or recuperated. The subject recovered from the AE.  
Recovering/resolving  - One of the possible results of an AE outcome that indicates that the 
event is improving.  
Recovered/resolved with sequelae - One of the possible results of an AE outcome where the 
subject recuperated but retained pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury.  
Unknown - There is an inability to access the subject or the subject’s records to determine 
the outcome ( i.e., subject withdraws consent or is lost to follow-up).  
Fatal  - The AE directly caused death.  
6.1.7 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determin ing whether 
an abnormal value in a subject represents a clinically significant change from subject’s baseline value  (Week 1, Day 1). In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 60 of 90 
 (based on the Investigator's judgment) or not requiring  treatment should not be recorded as 
AEs.  
6.1.8 Pregnancy and In Utero Drug Exposure  
Since SNF472 has not been evaluated in pregnant or nursing women, the treatment of pregnant 
women or women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception is  
contraindicated (see Section 4.7.4.2 for instructions on birth control).  
Pregnancies occurring in female subjects, or female partners of male subj ects are considered 
immediately reportable events if the pregnancy occurs during the study treatment through 30 
days after the subject’s last dose of study drug. If a pregnancy occurs in a subject, study drug  
must be discontinued immediately.  
The pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy using the Pregnancy Notification Form.  
The Investigator will follow the pregnant subject until completion of the pregnancy  and must 
notify the Sponsor of the pregnancy outcome within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge 
of the outcome. The Investigator will provide this information on the Pregnancy Outcome Report Form. This notification includes pregnancies resulting in live, “normal” births.  
If the pregnant subject experiences an SAE during pregnancy, or the outcome of the pregnancy meets any of the serious criteria ( i.e., spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected 
in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, ne onatal death, or congenital anomaly), the 
Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs specified in Section  6.3.1.2 . 
All neonatal d eaths and congenital anomalies that occur within 30 days of birth (regardless of 
causality) should be reported as SAEs to the Sponsor or designee. In addition, any infant death or congenital anomaly occurring after 30 days that the Investigator suspects is  related to the in 
utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported to the Sponsor or designee.  
6.2 HEMODIALYSIS -RELATED EVENTS  
The following events are known to occur during HD treatments and should be recorded in the eCRF as HD -related events rather than AEs. However, they should be recorded as AEs if they are 
considered to be unrelated to the HD treatment procedure  or if they worsen in s everity or 
increase in frequency during HD compared to baseline  (Week 1 Day 1). 
• Hypotension 
• Muscle cramps  
• Disequilibrium syndrome  
• Nausea  
• Vomiting  
• Headache  
• Fatigue

6.3 DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
6.3.1 Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events by Investigator  
6.3.1.1  Recording of Adverse Events  
AEs will be collected from the first time a subject receives study drug until completion of either 
the follow- up visit or an early termination visit. For subjects who discontinue study drug early 
and agree to complete all study assessments, all AEs should be collected until the follow -up 
visit. Subjects who discontinue study drug early and withdraw consent for completing further study assessments should complete an early termination visit 4 weeks after last dose of study 
drug and all AEs should be collected up to that time.  
All AEs  after informed consent signature but before the first dose of study drug  should be 
captured as medical hi story. 
All AEs experienced by a subject, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until the event has resolved  or stabilized, until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes 
observed, until the subject is lost to follow-up, or u ntil study follow- up is complete.  
All AEs, regardless of the relationship to study drug , will be recorded . All AE reports should 
contain a brief description of the event, date, and time of onset, date and time of resolution, severity, seriousness, treatment required, causal relation ship to study drug, action taken with 
the study drug , and outcome . 
In general, an AE that is the primary cause of subsequent events should be identified by the primary cause ( e.g.,  for dehydration due to diarrhea, the AE would be diarrhea). However, AEs 
occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events ( e.g.,  sepsis secondary to pneumonia, both events should be recorded).  
6.3.1.2  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur during the period of observation ( see Section 6.3.1.1) whether considered to 
be associated with the study drug  or not, must be entered in the eCRF  for reporting within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s first knowledge of the event. An alternat ive method of reporting 
will be provided to sites if eCRF access is not available . 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 62 of 90 
 The Investigator should not delay initial SAE report entry due to missing data. As soon as the 
minimum information is available , and no later than 24  hours  after becoming aware of the SAE, 
the initial SAE report will be entered into eCRF . 
If necessary, the I nvestigator will provide follow -up reports in a timely manner after knowledge 
of further relevant information.  
Detailed SAE reporting instructions and training will be provided to study site personnel . 
6.3.2 Reporting of Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities and Independent Ethics 
Committees/Institutional Review Boards  
The Sponsor or designee will be responsible for informing the r egulatory authority of SAEs 
according to local requirements.  
The Sponsor or their designee will provide annual safety reports to the r egulatory authorities , 
as applicable . These updates will include information on suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reac tions ( SUSARs ) and other relevant safety findings.  
The Sponsor or designee will notify regulatory authorities of any AE that is serious, unexpected, and related  to study drug  (i.e., a SUSAR ) according to  applicable local safety reporting 
requirements.  
The Sponsor or designee will notify the Investigators of  SUSARs that are submitted to 
regulatory authorities according to local country requirements . 
The Investigator will be responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of SAEs and SUSARs  according to local requirements.  
6.4 DATA AND SAFETY MONI TORING BOARD  
To minimize the possibility of exposing subjects to unusual risk, an external independent DSMB 
has been established. The DSMB will review safety data on a regular basis and will make 
recommendations to the Sponsor as to whether or not to continue the study. The roles and responsibilities of the DSMB are  defined in the DSMB Charter.  
 
7 DISCONTINUATION AND WITHDRAWALS 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY DRUG  
Subjects may discontinue study drug  at any time . The reasons  for which a subject may 
discontinue from study drug include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• AE 
• Subject request 
• Protocol violation  

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 63 of 90 
 • Investigator’s determination that discontinuation from treatment is appropriate (with 
documentation of the reason)   
• Discontinuation of study drug due to a CTCAE Grade 4 AE that is considered by the 
Investigator to be related to the study drug and not due to comorbidities or the disease.  
Subjects may request to stop  study drug at any time without penalty and for any reason 
without prejudice to his/her future medical care.   
If a subject requests to discontinue study drug, the Investigator should discuss the subject’s 
reasons for this request with the subject, including asking about the possible contribution of 
adverse events to the request. Based upon the subject’s responses, the Investigator should 
encourage the subject to continue receiving study drug if the subject’s concerns can be 
addressed. If the subject still requests to discontinue study drug , the reason for the request will 
be recorded in the e CRFs .  
Subjects who discontinue study drug during Part 1 should be asked to continue to complete all study assessments through the end of Part 1 and the follow- up visit as if they had remained on 
study drug. These subjects are not eligible to participate in Part 2 of the study.  
Subjects completing Part 1 who subsequently discontinue SNF472 during Part 2 should be asked 
to continue to complete all study assessments through the end of Part 2 and the follow- up visit 
as if they had remained on SNF472.  
Adverse events will continue to be collected from subjects who request early discontinuation 
from the study drug during Part 1 or Part 2 but continue to  participate in the trial assessments 
for remaining visits .  
All subjects requesting early discontinuation and withdrawal of consent for follow- up visits 
should be informed of the potential greater public health value of the study if they complete 
the foll ow-up assessments and visits . 
7.2 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECT FROM THE STUDY  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons including but not 
limited to : 
• Pregnancy 
• AE (including CTCAE Grade 4 AE considered related by Investigator as define d above)  
• Subject request/ withdrawal of consent 
• Investigator’s determination that discontinuation from treatment is appropriate (with 
documentation of the reason)   
• Death 
• Discontinuation of the study or the study center by Sponsor’s decision 
Subjects who discontinue study drug and are unwilling to complete the remaining study 
assessments will be encouraged to return for an early termination visit  4 weeks after the last 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 64 of 90 
 dose of study drug to complete the procedures outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  2). Subjects who withdraw consent for continuing assessments and follow- up visits and 
for non -patient contact (e.g., medical records check)  will be asked to sign the withdrawal of 
consent form, indicating withdrawal of  consent for the remaining follow- up visits, assessments, 
and/or disallow ing further access to their medical records.  
If a subject is withdrawn from the study due to an AE, the subject should continue to be 
provided  medical care. This may include, if needed, referral to another physician. The AE that 
led to study withdrawal should be followed until an outcome can be defined.  
If a subject withdraws consent from the study and also  withdraws consent for disclosure of 
future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should 
be collected . The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such refusal 
for further follow-up. 
7.3 STORAG E OF S AMPLES 
Blood samples collected for PK, PD, and biomarker analyses will be stored under the control of the Sponsor for a maximum of 1 .5 year s after study end and then destroyed.  
 
8 STATISTICAL METHODS  
The methods for the planned statistical analyses of efficacy, PK, PD,  and safety endpoints are 
summarized in the following sections. Statistical analyses for additional parameters ( e.g.,  
subject characteristics, disposition, exposure, compliance); and more detailed descriptions of the methods presented in this section  will be provided in the statistical analysis plan  (SAP) . Any 
major deviations from the planned analyses specified in the protocol and  SAP will be 
documented in the clinical study report.  
8.1 ENDPOINTS  
Unless otherwise indicated “baseline” refers t o the assessment on Week 1, Day 1 . 
8.1.1 Efficacy  Endpoints  
In Part 1, the primary, secondary, and exploratory efficacy endpoints will compare the placebo and SNF472 groups as follows : 
 
Alternate Primary Efficacy Endpoints:  
• Absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in the BWAT -CUA  score for the primary 
lesion  
• Absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in Pain VAS score  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s (assessed hierarchically) :  
• Absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in the Wound- QoL score

8.2 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
8.2.1 Planned Sample Size  
The sample size calculation is based on the effect sizes and standard deviations (SD) observed 
for changes  in BWAT -CUA and Pain VAS from baseline to Week 12 in the Phase  2 study 
(SNFCT2015 -04). The effect sizes for  BWAT -CUA and Pain VAS were 6.3 and 24 units, 
respectively, with SDs of 6.5 and 31.4  units. Assuming similar results and based on 1,000,000 
trial simulations, a sample size of  66 subjects (33 per group) will provide an overall power of 
between 95.1% and 99.0% (corresponding to correlations between test statistics of ρ  = 0.90 to 
0) when the alternate primary endpoints are tested using a Hochberg closed test procedure 
with a 4% a lpha level, 2 -sided.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 67 of 90 
 8.2.2 Sample Size Re-E stimation 
A SSRE procedure is planned when primary endpoint data is available from approximately 33 of 
the planned total of 66 subjects randomized and treated for 12 weeks . This procedure will be 
conducted blind to the S ponsor by a fully independent statistical service provider. The 
conditional power (CP) will be computed for both alternate primary endpoints, BWAT CUA and 
Pain VAS, using the methods described by  Mehta and Pocock (2011) . Table 10 gives the 
decision rule with regards to continuation of the study with or without a sample size increase . 
Any increase in sample size will be capped at 50% of the planned sample size  (i.e., the 
maximum total sample size will be capped at 66 + 1/2 x 66 = 99 subjects) . With 100,000 trial 
simulations, this procedure was shown not to inflate the overall type I error and, hence, no 
alpha adjustment is required in the final analysis .  
 
 Table 10. Decision Rules for Sample Size Increase  
 
 
The CP computed as per Mehta and Pocock (2011 ) will give rise to two CP values, CP 1 and CP 2, 
for each of the two primary endpoints respectively; based on these CP values, Equation 9 in Mehta and Pocock (2011)  will be used to compute  the corresponding post -interim sample s izes, 
𝑛𝑛 �
1 and 𝑛𝑛 �2, required to deliver the cross tabulated power as displayed in  Table 10. This , in turn, 
will give two new sample size totals for the study, 𝑁𝑁 1 and 𝑁𝑁2, relating to the two primary 
endpoints. The larger of 𝑁𝑁 1 and 𝑁𝑁2 will be taken as the revised sample size for the study subject 
to a maximal increase of 99 subjects ( i.e., at most a 50% increase over the planned sample size 
of N=66 subjects) . The final analysis will then combine the pre - and post -interim z -values for 
each of the two primary endpoints using NOT the approach suggested by Mehta and Pocock 
2011 but rather the approach defined by Cui et al (1999)  which guarantees no  alpha inflation 
regardless of how the post- interim sample sizes ( i.e., 𝑛𝑛 �1 and 𝑛𝑛 �2) are determined.  
 
The independent statistical service provider  will provide the conditional power and sample size 
computations to the independent DSMB only . The DSMB will review these results and the 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06

  Page 68 of 90 
 associated decision rule from Table 10 and provide  only the sample size recommendation to 
the Sponsor.  The Sponsor will not receive the conditional power  assessments.  
 
Finally, the Sponsor retains full discretion with regards to the outcome of the sample size re -
estimation procedure and may decide to continue the trial with the sample size  increased as 
described above or  unchanged.  
8.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
The following analysis populations will be defined: Safety, modified Intent-to- Treat ( mITT), Per 
Protocol (PP), PK , and PD. 
The Safety population will consist of all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of 
study drug . Subjects will be analyz ed according to the treatment they  received. The Safety 
analysis  population will be used for analyses of safety endpoints.  
The mITT population will consist of all enrolled subjects who are random ized, receive at least 
one dose of study drug , and have at least one post -randomization efficacy evaluation . Subjects 
will be analy zed according to the treatment to which they were random ized. Consistent with 
ICH E9, t he m ITT population will be the primary analysis population  for efficacy endpoints .  
The PP population will be the subset of subjects in the m ITT population who do not have m ajor 
protocol violations, have evaluable primary efficacy data, and have received a pre-specified 
minimum study drug exposure. The PP population will be used for supportive analyses of 
efficacy endpoints . Additional details will be outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
The PK population will consist of all subjects who are randomized and receive at least  one dose 
of study drug  and for whom the primary PK parameter (C max) can be calculated.  
The PD population will consist of all subjects who are randomized and receive at least one dose 
of study drug  and for whom both pre- dose  and EOI HAP crystallization inhibition can be 
calculated for at least one timepoint . 
8.4 SUBGROUPS , COVARIATES, AND ST RATA  
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoint analyse s will be stratified by STS use  at 
randomization . For endpoints measuring change from baseline, baseline values of the efficacy 
variable will be included in statistical models as covariate s. The following subgroups may be 
explored for the primary and seconda ry endpoints: age, sex, race, region, and major comorbid 
conditions ( e.g.,  diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease) . 
8.5 GENERAL STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Efficacy, PK, PD, biomarker, and safety data will be summarized descriptively using mean, 
median,  SD, standard error (SE), first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), minimum, and maximum 
values for continuous variables and using counts (n) and percentages for categorical variables.  
Unless specified otherwise, all baseline assessments will be based upon the Week 1, Day 1  pre-
dose  assessment.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 69 of 90 
 8.6 EFFICACY ANALYSES  
The mITT population will be the primary analysis population for all primary , secondary and 
exploratory efficacy endpoint analyses.  Unless otherwise indicated “baseline” refers to the 
assessment on Week 1, Day 1.  
8.6.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
The comparison of absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in BWAT -CUA  score between 
treatment groups will be achieved using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis 
to estimate the difference between randomized treatment group least squares means 
(LS means) at 12 weeks. The model will include fixed effect terms for randomized treatment, 
visit, and visit by randomized treatment interaction; the model will also be stratified for STS use 
at randomization  and baseline BWAT -CUA  score and will be included as covariates. Subject will 
be fitted as a random effect and an unstructured variance -covariance matrix will be used.  
The comparison of absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in the Pain VAS score  will be 
analyzed using an MMRM analysis similar to that for the change in BWAT -CUA  score with 
covariates for baseline Pain VAS score and stratified for STS use at randomization . 
The MMRM analysis assumes any missing data are missing at random; therefore, sensitivity 
analyses under the assumption of missing not at random will be used to assess the robustness 
of the primary MMRM analysis. These sensitivity analyses will include (i) jump to reference multiple imputation (MI) which assumes that subjects with monotone missingness in the experimental treatment arm follow the same distribution as observations from subjects in the contr ol arm and (ii) a tipping point analysis to identify whether the penalty, if applied to 
subjects with missing data in the experimental treatment arm, would result in the loss of statistical significance of the primary analysis  (Ouyang et al, 2017 ). 
8.6.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses  
The secondary endpoints will be evaluated hierarchically in the following order:  
1. Absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in the Wound- QoL score  
2. Absolute change from baseline to Week 12 wound healing assessed by the BWAT total 
score  
3. Qualitative wound image evaluation for the primary lesion (worsened, equal to, or improved relative to baseline) at Week  12 
4. Rate of change in opioid use as measured in MME from baseline to Week 12  
The first secondary efficacy endpoint of the absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in 
Wound- QoL score will be analyzed using an MMRM analysis similar to that for the alternate 
primary efficacy endpoints with covariates for baseline Wound- QoL score and stratified for STS 
use at randomization . 
The second  secondary efficacy endpoint of the absolute change from baseline to Week 12 
wound healing assessed by the BWAT total score will be analyzed with MMRM in the same 
fashion with baseline BWAT total score as a covariate and stratified by STS use at 
randomization .  

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 70 of 90 
 The third secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using generalized estimating equations 
with the primary result  displayed in terms of the Week 12 odds ratio for SNF472 vs placebo 
along with the associated 95% CI and 2- sided p- value.  
For the fourth secondary endpoint, the daily average opioid dose in MME will be calculated for 
all subjects prior to randomization and post -randomization on a weekly basis. The maintenance 
opioid dose will be defined as the average daily  opioid dose in MME during the week prior to 
Screening Visit 2 . To assess the extent to which opioid use may have differed between 
randomized treatment arms over time , the change from baseline in daily average MME value 
will be analyzed via a mixed model r andom coefficients analysis. MME data collected between 
Week 1  and Week 12 will be the dependent variable with random subject effects for intercepts 
and slopes. Fixed effects for randomized treatment, baseline MME value, week, and randomized treatment-by-week interaction will be included and an unstructured covariance 
matrix assumed to estimate the rate of change of opioid use over time for both SNF472 and placebo and assess whether the rate of use differs between randomized treatments. The treatment effect will therefore be the contrast between SNF472 and placebo slope estimates 
over 1 to 12 weeks. The associated slope estimates, difference in slopes, CI, and two -sided p-
value will be extracted from the model and presented.  
For each of the secondary endpoints, sensitivity analyses to explore the influence of missing 
data will be performed using multiple imputation and tipping point analyses.  
8.6.3 Overall Type I Error Control  
With two alternate primary endpoints assessed using a closed test procedure followed by 
secondary endpoints tested hierarchically (if at least one of the alternate primary endpoints is statistically positive), there is no scope for Type  I error inflation if SNF472 is fully in the null, i.e.,  
is identical to placebo treatment . However,  if it is assumed that SNF472 is simultaneously a 
placebo for one alternate endpoint yet is a highly effective treatment for the second, the 
overall Type I error rate can be inflated when testing is extended to the secondary endpoints . 
To prevent any overall  Type I error inflation the alternate primary endpoints will be assessed 
using a Hochberg procedure with a 2 -sided alpha level of 4% . If both alternate primary 
endpoints are met, the alpha apportioned will be recycled so that the secondary endpoints will 
be assessed at the 5% alpha level, 2 -sided. If only one of the alternate primary endpoints is met, 
the secondary endpoints will be assessed at the 1% alpha level, 2 -sided.  
8.6.4 Exploratory  Efficacy Endpoint Analyses  
Briefly , mean changes over time will be asses sed using  MMRM modelling, binary response 
endpoints will be assessed using generalized linear mixed effect modelling, and time-to-event endpoints will be assessed using Kaplan- Meier analysis . Given these analyses are exploratory, 
they will not be subject t o Type I error control, nominal p -values will be presented and 
interpreted accordingly.

 8.7 PHARMACODYNAMICS ANALYSES 
At Weeks 1, 12, 13, and 24 t he level of HAP crystal formation in EOI samples will be compared 
to the level of HAP crystal formation in the pre- dose  sample and will be reported as a percent 
(%) inhibition of crystallization.  
Percent inhibition of HAP crystal lization  between pre- dose  and EOI at Weeks 1, 12,  13, and 24 , 
will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.  
8.8 PHARMACOKINETICS ANALYSES  
The PK endpoint, SNF472 plasma concentrations pre- dose  and EOI at Weeks 1, 12, 13, and 24, 
will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. Accumulation effects will be assessed by comparing 
the individual and mean EOI plasma concentrations between Weeks  1, 12,  13, and 24.  
8.9 SAFETY ANALYSES  
Safety endpoints will be analyzed descriptively  using the Safety population. The primary 
analysis of safety endpoints will use the period from the first dose of study drug until 30 days after the last dose of study drug.  
8.9.1 Adverse Events  
All reported terms ( Investigator descriptions) for AEs will be coded using the most recent 
version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) . All treatment -emergent 
AEs will be summariz ed using counts and percentages by treatment group, study period (Part 1 , 
Part 2, and follow -up), system organ class ( SOC) classification, and preferred term . Additionally, 
treatment-emergent AEs in the following categories will be summarized:  AEs leading to death, 
SAEs, AEs leading to discon tinuation from the study, treatment -related AEs, AEs by Common 
Terminology Criteria for Ad verse Events (CTCAE) severity grade , and CUA wound- related AEs . 
For all AE summaries, events will be counted only once for each subject  by primary SOC and 
preferred term . When an AE  occurs more than once for a subject, the maximum severity and 
causality will be used.  
8.9.2 Hemodialysis -Related Events  
HD-related events will be summarized using counts and percentages by treatment group, study 
period (Part 1, Part 2, and follo w-up). 
8.9.3 Clinical Laboratory Evaluation  
Laboratory assessments and change from baseline will be summariz ed using descriptive 
statistics by panel, test, treatment group, and time point. Additionally, abnormal results will be summariz ed using counts and percentages by laboratory grade, panel, test, treatment group, 
and time point.

 8.9.4 Holter  Monitoring  and Electrocardiograms  
Holter data will be analyzed centrally by extracting triplicate ECGs from the recordings at each 
of the following 3 timepoints: pre- dose , EOI,  and end of dialysis. The central reader will be 
blinded to the treatment assignment for Part 1 for the duration of the study , including Part 2 
and follow-up until the study database is locked . 
The results from  the central reader assessment  of ECGs extracted from the Holter as well as the 
results of the Holter will be used in the analyses.  The following intervals will be summarized 
using counts and percentages by treatment group and time point: PR, QRS, RR,  HR, uncorrected 
QT, QTcB, and QTcF . Details of additional analyses will be provided in the SAP.  
8.9.5 Vital Signs  
The change from baseline of vital signs (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, 
respiratory rate, and body temperature) and body weight will be summar ized with descripti ve 
statistics by treatment group and time point.  
8.9.6 CUA Wound Care  
Wound care received for CUA lesions will be listed by subject.  
8.9.7 Physical Examination F indings  
Physical examination findings will be listed by subject.  
 
9 DATA MANAGEMENT, MONITORING AND AUDITS  
9.1 STUDY MONITORING  
The Sponsor will be responsible for monitoring the study according to ICH GCP, although the 
actual monitoring visits may be conducted by a CRO in accordance with Sponsor requirements, as specified in the Monitoring Plan. Both central and o n-site monitoring will be conducted.  
Central monitoring will include data review by the monitor via the EDC off -site, with a focus on 
incomplete fields and fields in which potential errors could exist, based on the monitor’s 
understanding of the data speci fication. 
On site, the monitor will review the eCRF data entry against the source documents. Handling of 
queries and clarification/reconciliation of queries between the monitor and the  site will be 
described in the Data Management Plan ( DMP). 
9.2 DATA CAPTURE AND V ERIFICATION  
Data capture and management will be conducted using multiple electronic syste ms (e.g.,  RTSM, 
ePRO, i maging software, and EDC ). All systems will be compliant with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), meet all req uirements for 21 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 11 and Annex 11 of EUDRALEX Rules Governing Medicinal Product in the 

Sanifit Therapeutics S.A.   Study SNFCT2017- 06 
CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 73 of 90 
 European Union, Volume 4, Good Manufacturing Practice. The processes and responsibilities of 
data collection, management, and quality ass urance will be specified in the DMP.  
All applicable study data collected for each subject will be entered into the designated system(s) by trained study personnel according to the completion expectations. This training 
will be available on demand for refre sher training. Study visit assessment data ( e.g.,  vital signs, 
physical exam, ECG, Pain VAS, Wound -QoL, and BWAT) are expected to be entered directly into 
the designated system(s) at the time of the subject visit or when the assessment is performed 
(e.g.,  central wound rating group qualitative image review). Data already located in the 
subject’s medical chart (medical history, medications, laboratory results) or data collected by study personnel untrained on the use of the EDC may be transcribed into the eC RF. Source 
documents, such as the clinic chart, are to be maintained separately from the eCRF to allow 
data verification. Because of the potential for errors, inaccuracies, and illegibility in transcribing 
data into eCRFs, original documentation of transcribed study data must be maintained at the site.  
Authorized personnel will verify data entered into eCRFs for completeness and accuracy with reference to the source documents and records and will issue data queries to correct missing data or discrepancies f ound against the source within the EDC system. Data validation will 
consist of automated and manual edit checks that are created directly in the EDC system. Edit 
checks will be executed on all data points defined and documented by the study team and data 
management will be able to issue manual queries as needed to the eCRF. Study metrics will be 
reported from the EDC system.  
Only authorized site personnel will be able to enter/modify/correct data in the eCRF. Once all data have been verified by the Sponsor or designee, the Investigator must electronically sign the eCRF; this responsibility may not be delegated to other study personnel.  
Non -transcribed data entered into an applicable system will be validated with automated edit 
checks at the time of entry . Data entered into systems other than EDC require an authorized 
electronic signature at the time of record save and do not require verification. 
9.3 ON-SITE AUDITS  
During the course of the study and/or after study completion, one or more study sites may be audite d by authorized representatives of the Sponsor. The purpose of the audit is to determine 
whether or not the study is being conducted and monitored in compliance with ICH GCP and relevant local regulations.  
Additionally, the study may be inspected by the IR B/IEC or regulatory authorities. These 
inspections may take place at any time during or after completion of the study and are based on local regulations.

10.2 INFORMED CONSENT  
All subjects will be required to participate in the consent process. During the consent process, 
Investigator or designee  obtaining consent will inform the subject of all elements of informed 
consent. No protocol -specific procedures, including screening procedures , will be performed 
until the subject has signed and dated an IRB/IEC -approved ICF. Study participation will start 
with the signing and dating of the ICF . A copy of the ICF will be provided to the  subject for their 
records, and the original signed and dated ICF will be maintained in the source documentation 
files at the study site.  
The Investigator must ensure that the subject is given full and adequate oral and written 
information about the nature, purpose, and possible risk s and benefits of the study . Subjects 
must also be notified that participation in the study is voluntary and that they are free to 
withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to future care. The subject should be 
given  the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided.   
In case of protocol amendment, the patient information l eaflet  (PIL) /subject information sheet 
and ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes . If the PIL/subject information sheet and 
ICF are revised, they must be reviewed and approved by the responsible IRB/IEC and signed by 
all subjects subsequently enrolled in the study as well as those currently enrolled in the study. 
10.3 SUBJECT  CONFIDENTIALITY AND DISCLOSURE 
All study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential. The Investigator and members of his research team must not disclose such information without prior written approval from the Sponsor.  
The Investigator must anonymize the data of the participating subjects. In this regard, the Sites 
and the Investigators shall be the unique parties with access to the personal data of the participating subjects. As a consequence, from a data protection approach, the Investigator  
and/or the Site acts as Data Controller of the personal data of the participating subjects and shall comply with all of its obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation, including obtaining the informed consent of the data subjects. The Investigator shall ensure that the data has been anonymi zed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation. The Sites and 
the Investigator shall also be responsible to comply with “HIPAA Privacy Rule” (which means the privacy rule issued under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and codified at 45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 164).

 The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained. All subject data will be identified 
only by a subject ID number. Subject names and addresses must be maintained in a separate 
log. Documents that identify the subject ( e.g.,  ICF) must be maintained in confidence by the 
Investigator.  
However, in compliance with regulatory guidelines regarding the monitoring of clinical studies and in fulfilment of his/her obligations to the Sponsor, the Investigator must allow the study monitor, Sponsor representative or auditor, and/or IRB/IEC and relevant regulatory authority representatives access to the portion of the subject’s medical record that is directly related to the study. The data to which the Sponsor representative or auditor would have access in this case will be anonymized at all times. Such information shall include all study-relevant documentation, including medical history to verify eligibility, admission/discharge summaries 
for hospital stays occurring while the subject is enrolled in the study, and autopsy reports if a 
death occurs during the study.  
The anonymi zed data received by Sponsor may be subject to international transfers . 
 
10.4 INDEPENDENT ETHICS  COMMITTEE/ INSTITUT IONAL REVIEW BOARD 
APPROVALS  AND NOTIFICATIONS  
Before the start of the study , the protocol and other relevant documents will be approved by 
the IRB/IEC and relevant r egulatory authorities in accordance with local regulatory 
requirements . The Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met 
before the first subject is enrolled in the study . The Investigator must conduct the study in 
compliance with the protocol.  
Alterations to the protocol by the Sponsor will be documented in the form of a protocol amendment. Administrative changes may be made by the Sponsor without the need for a formal protocol amendment. All protocol amendments and administrative changes will be distributed by the Sponsor to all protocol recipients, with appropriate instructions.  
The protocol  amendments must be approved by the IRB/IEC and relevant regulatory authority 
prior to implementation (as appropriate) unless immediate implementation of the amendment is needed  to eliminate a hazard to a sub ject or subjects.  
During the course of the study, the Investigator should promptly inform the IRB/IEC of the following: 
• Deviations from, or changes of, the protocol to eliminate immediate hazards to the study 
subjects 
• Changes increasing the risk to subjects and/or affecting significantly the conduct of the study 
• All adverse drug reactions that are both serious and unexpected  
• New information that may affect adversely the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the 
study

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL   Amendment 3, 9 DEC 2021 
   
 
  Page 76 of 90 
 • Study suspension or closure ( Section  10.5) 
If a safety issue of clinical relevance is identified, from review of any data, then the Sponsor will 
promptly notify the Investigator and relevant regulatory authorities, and the Investigator must 
inform the IRB/IEC of the safety issue as soon as possible after notification.  
A safety issue of clinical relevance is one that has a relevant impact on the cours e of the study 
or program (including the potential for suspension of the study, program , or amendments to 
the protocol ) or warrants immediate update of the PIL  and ICF.  
10.5 STUDY  CLOSURE  
The study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated by the Sponsor  at any 
time for any reason. Reasons for suspension or termination of the study  may include, but are 
not limited to, determination of unacceptable risk to subject safety, noncompliance or 
insufficient data, or early  determination of efficacy or futility. Written notification, documenting 
the reason for suspension/termination, will be provided to the Investigators and relevant 
regulatory authorities.  
The Investigator must promptly notify the subjects and IRB/IEC of study completion or suspension/ ET. In the event of suspension/ ET, the notification should include the reason for the 
change in study status, and subjects must be contacted regarding any applicable changes to the study visit schedule.  
The Investigator must  submit eCRFs and all other relevant data and records to the Sponsor  as 
soon as possible after the completion or ET of the study.  
10.6 RECORD R ETENTION  
According to ICH GCP , essential documents should be retained for a minimum of 2  years after 
the last approval of  a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2  years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study drug . However, these documents 
should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or 
by an agreement with the Sponsor. The Sponsor will inform the Investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
 
11 STEERING COMMITTEE 
A trial steering committee composed of academic nephrology, wound care and surgical experts , 
and dialysis care experts participated in the development of the protocol and will provide

    PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
Of note, version 2.0 (dated 16 December 2021) has been generated to implement changes 
mandated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and some European Regulatory Authorities. This version has only been submitted to the US FDA but has not been shared with any other regulatory authority and has not been implemented in any country. 
Thus, version 3.0 (dated 07 April 2022) has been generated from version 1.0 (dated 06 May 
2021), to implement all changes described in global amendment 2, as well as those 
introduced by global amendment 1. 
 
Version 5.0, 27 September 2023 
Global Amendment 4 (substantial)  
Description of change and rationale for change:  
The protocol has been amended to reflect the following key changes, which have been 
incorporated in the protocol and protocol summary where applicable: 
1. This study was initiated as a randomized, placebo- controlled, double -blind, 
parallel -group, multicenter, adaptive Phase  2b/3 study. The study was planned to 
consist of a 4- week Screening Period, a 52 -week Double- blind Treatment Period, 
a 52-week Extension Phase Treatment Period, and a 12- week Follow -up Period. 
The total duration of the study for patients remaining in the study until their final 
follow- up assessment was planned to be approximately 2 years and 4  months. 
 The feasibility to conduct the study within an acceptable time frame  under this 
design has proved challenging. This is considered to be related to new and more 
frequently used treatment options, which the current protocol allows for, such as 
obeticholic acid (OCA) and off -label use of bezafibrates. One consequence of 
this is that fewer patients than anticipated are meeting the inclusion criteria of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≥ 1.67 and liver stiffness  ≥8.0 kPa . Therefore, the 
study design is revised to a Phase 2b study. The following key changes include: 
a. Revision of primary and secondary objectives, ie , the decrease in ALP 
from Baseline at 24 weeks as primary objective and no further selection 
of a key secondary parameter. 
b. Corresponding to the new primary endpoint 
i. A new sample size calculation was performed that resulted in 60  
to 70 patients instead of 318, and a reduced number of sites ( 80 to 
130).  
ii. The statistical methods planned to be applied were revised. 
c. Reduction of the Double -blind Treatment Period from 1 year to 24 weeks,

 Confidential   
    d. The rationale for a 52-week Extension Phase Treatment Period  is no 
longer applicable ; therefore, this period as well as the 12- week Follow -
up Period have been removed. 
e. With the reduction of the Double-blind Treatment Period to 24 weeks, 
the optional liver biopsy at W eek 52 has been removed , it is not expected 
to find effects at an earlier time point.  
f. The rational e for an interim analysis , ie, the  assessment of futility and 
dose selection,  is no longer applicable ; therefore, the interim analysis has 
been removed.  The study design is no longer adaptive. 
g. Corresponding to changes t o the overall study design, the statistical 
methods planned to be applied were revised, including the definition of 
the Full Analyses Set (FAS)  handling of missing data values, the plans 
for sensitivity and supplementary analyses. 
2. To enhance enrollment, the option for a second rescreening (ie, after failure of initial and first rescreening) has been added to Section 4.3. 
3. To enhance enrollment by limiting the number of assessments for patients , the 
magnetic resonance elastography  (MRE) to assess liver and spleen stiffness has 
been removed.  
4. Exclusion criterion 18 has been removed. The FDA approved FibroScan
® 
assessments in patients treated with or for planned treatment with a pacemaker, implanted cardioverter defibrillator, or other implanted electronic device.  
5. The criterion for premature discontinuation of the investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) has been amended for patients with a severe cardiac condition or QT prolongation or an increase in QTc greater than 60  milliseconds from 
Baseline. 
6. APPENDIX II – Detection and Management of Suspected or Confirmed Cases 
of Drug -Induced Liver Injury, has been updated according to FDA 
recommendations:  
a. Patient are instructed to return to the study center within 24 to 48 hours 
instead of 48 to 72 hours.  
b. In case of specified laboratory abnormalities the IMP will be discontinued 
instead of interrupted.  
c. Follow- Up procedures for patient(s) who meet suspected DILI evaluation 
criteria  have been extended.  
7. Administrative changes in the address of the Sponsor and the address and safety center of the contract research organization (CRO) . 
8. Editorial changes to increase readability and consistency.

    Special Note:  Patients who are following the previous protocol schedule (protocol 
version 4) and are already beyond Week 24 should permanently discontinue IMP as soon 
as possible and have an End-of-Treatment Visit 30  days after their last dose . 
 
 
Version 4.0, 14 March  2023  
Global Amendment 3 (substantial) 
Description of change and rationale for change:  
The protocol has been amended to reflect the following key changes, which have been 
incorporated in the protocol and protocol summary where applicable: 
1. If futility is not met for the setanaxib 1200 mg/day and 1600 mg/day doses, the 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) will select one dose for 
Stage 2. Ongoing patients who are receiving the selected dose will continue the 
study at the same dose. Ongoing patients who are receiving a dose that is 
discontinued will have their dose escalated/de -escalated to the selected dose. 
Patients enrolled after the interim analysis will be randomized to setanaxib (dose 
selected by the IDMC), or placebo, according to a 1:1 randomization ratio, up to 
full enrollment. 
2. An analysis of the proportion of patients with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
reduction of ≥70% reduction from Baseline at Week 52 and changes in markers 
of cholestasis as assessed by proportion of patients at Week 52 with ALP 
reduction to <1.5×upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin ≤1×ULN and 
with a ≥40% ALP reduction from Baseline have been added following 
recommendations from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, 
respectively.  
3. The exploratory endpoint of changes in markers of cholestasis has been upgraded 
to secondary endpoint (as above mentioned). 
4. The list of prohibited medications was updated with regard to corticosteroid use and removal of biologics.

    Study design:  
This study is  a randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, parallel- group, multicenter, Phase 2b  study 
assessing oral setanaxib administered as an add -on therapy in patients with PBC, elevated liver stiffness, 
and intolerance or inadequate response to UDCA. The  safety and efficacy of 1200 mg/day and 
1600 mg/day setanaxib will be assessed against matching placebo over 2 4 weeks of treatment. It is planned 
to enroll approximately 60 to 70 patients at 80 to 130 investigational centers in North America, Europe,  
Israel,  Australia, and New Zealand.  
The study design is outlined in Figure 1, and the visit schedule and planned assessments at each visit are 
detailed in Table  1. 
The study will consist of a 4- week Screening Period, a 24- week Double -blind  Treatment Period , and a 
4-week Follow -up Period. The total duration of the study for patien ts remaining in the study until their 
final follow -up assessment ( End-of-Treatment [ EoT] Visit 30 days after the last investigational medicinal 
product [IMP] dose) will be approximately 32  weeks (approximately 8 months).  
The Investigator will obtain signed informed consent from the patien t before any study procedures are 
performed.  Patients will be assessed for eligibility during the Screening Period. All patients will attend 
Screening Visit 1. If liver biochemistry  (see Footnote  i of Table  1) and/or serum pregnancy  (see Footnote  l 
of Table  1) retests are required, patients will attend Screening Visit 2. Screening Visit  1 and, if required , 
Screening Visit 2 should be completed within 4  weeks prior to Randomization. If  required, Screening 
Visit 2 should be conducted by Day - 4. 
At a subset of study sites that accept referral patients or where sparse transient elastography (FibroScan®) 
assessments are standard  of care , a pre-S creening visit including local laboratory liver function tests and 
transient elastography can be performed to assess patient eligibility . The Investigator  will then obtain 
signed pre -screening consent. Data obtained at a pre-Screening visit cannot be re -used for screening. Full 
standard screening must be repeated for patient enrol lment.  
Baseline assessments will be performed on Day  1 (Visit 3). Post -Baseline assessments will be performed 
at Week s 2 (Visit 4), 4 (Visit 5), 8 (Visit 6), 12 (Visit 7 ), and 24 (Visit 8 ). In addition, study patients will 
be contacted by phone by the study site staff at Weeks 16  and 20. 
Following permanent IMP discontinuation at any time during the study, patients will undergo an EoT Visit 30 days after their last dose. If IMP is permanently discontinued, the  study assessments should continue 
until completion of the Week  24 Visit (Visit 8) . If it is not feasible  to complete all the visits , every possible  
effort should be made to complete the Week 24 Visit. 
The Investigator, the site personnel, the Sponsor, and their representatives involved in monitoring and 
conducting the study, and the patien ts will be blinded to treatment assignments until the database is locked 
and the study is unblinded for analysis . 
If applicable, patients will continue UDCA, obeticholic  acid (OCA), and bezafibrate or fenofibrate 
treatment at a stable dose during the Double -blind Treatment Period. Patients should not start additional 
treatments for PBC after Randomization. All medications will be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). 
Throughout the study, particular attention will be given to the detection and management of AESIs; suspected cases of DILI, potential cases of bone marrow toxicity, and potential cases of hypothyroidism.  
The Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) will oversee the safety of participating patients. 
The role and responsibilities of the IDMC will be outlined in an IDMC Charter. An Adjudication 
Committee, who will remain blinded to patient treatment assignment, will adjudicate the AESIs and the adverse clinical outcomes. The roles and responsibilities of the Adjudication Committee will be outlined in an Adjudication Charter.

    Study duration:  
The study is expected to be conducted from Q3  2021 to Q 2 2024 . The start of the  study will be the date 
on which the first patient provides informed consent, and the end of the study will be the last patient’s last 
assessment.  
The total study duration for an individual patient is up to approximately 32  weeks (approximately 
8 months): A 4- week  Screening Period, a 24 -week Double -blind Treatment Period, and a 4- week Follow -
up Period. 
Planned number of patients:  It is planned to enroll approximately 60 to 70  patients. Patients will be 
randomized and allocated to placebo, setanaxib 1200 mg/day, or setanaxib 1600 mg/day according to a 
1:1:1 randomization ratio.  
This study is designed to detect a >25% reduction in ALP in setanaxib -treated patients versus a 2.5% 
reduction in the placebo arm with an overall 2 -sided p<0.05.  Standard deviations are assumed to be 19% 
and 24% , respectively, based on the Phase 2a study with setanaxib and the Phase 3 POISE study with 
Ocaliva. With approximately 16 evaluable patients per arm (48 patients overall) and using a Hochberg step-up test to control alpha across 2 dose comparisons versus placebo, this study has  88.2% global power 
to detect at least 1 treatment arm as significantly different from placebo and 68.3 % power to detect both 
treatment arms as statistically significant.  Also, for the secondary endpoint of change in fatigue, there will 
be >80% power to detect a 20% reduction in fatigue versus a 2.5% increase in the placebo arm . 
An assumed  dropout rate of approximately 25% leads to a target sample size of 66 enrolled patients (22  per 
arm). A range of approximately 60 to 70 enrolled patients allows for variability in the assumed dropout rate. 
Target population:  Male or female patients aged ≥18 years with a definite or probable PBC diagnosis, 
serum ALP levels of ≥1.67×ULN at Screening, and liver stiffness measured by transient elastography (FibroScan
®) of ≥8.0 kPa at Screening, will be included. Patients must have taken a UDCA prescriptional 
dose for the past 6 months (at a stable dose for >3  months prior to Screening) OR be intolerant to UDCA 
(last dose of UDCA >3  months prior to Screening). Intolerance to UDCA is defined as patients unable to 
tolerate the full -labeled dose of UDCA in PBC (13 -15 mg/kg) due to frequently reported gastrointestinal 
symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.  Any patients receiving OCA, fenofibrate, or bezafibrate 
must have been taki ng the agent(s) for at least 6 months and at a stable dose for >3  months prior to 
Screening.  
Patients with any historical or current hepatic decompensation event, cirrhosis  with complications, 
or competing etiology for liver disease will be excluded, as will patients with total bilirubin  levels of  
>2×ULN or plasma ALT  and/or AST  levels of >3×ULN. Patients with an INR of >1.2 will also be 
excluded, unless the patient is on anticoagulant therapy.

    Statistical methods:  
Efficacy Analysis:  The  Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be the primary set used for all efficacy analyses , along 
with the summary of disposition, demographics, and Baseline characteristics . Patients will be analyzed  
according to the treatment group they were randomized to regardless of the actual treatment received.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  Each s etanaxib treatment group (1600 mg/day and 1200 mg/day) will be 
compared with placebo. The primary estimand is to assess the change in ALP  (%) over 24 weeks in patients 
with PBC, elevated liver stiffness, and intolerance or inadequate response to UDCA . 
The following intercurrent events will be considered and further detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP). Pa
tients who start additional PBC -related medication(s) after R andomization will have their IMP 
discontinued.  These patients will be included in the analysis, but efficacy data collected after the start of 
the new therapy will be excluded. For all other patients who discontinue from treatment prior to Week 24 but return for the Week 24 Visit (Visit 8), the Week 24 result will be included in the analysis.  Patients with 
a missing Week 24 result will have their value imputed based on observed data.  
The primary endpoint will be evaluated using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with 
log(ALP) – log(Baseline) as response with log( Baseline) as a continuous covariate, ALP stratification 
(<3.0 ×ULN or ≥ 3.0×ULN), treatment and visit as categorical covariates and treatment by visit as 
interaction term. All ALP data captured at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 , and 24 will be included in the model. The 
relative mean change from Baseline at Week 24 will be estimated and corresponding 2- sided 95% 
confidence intervals will be calculated. In the case of outliers in the ALP data, a sensitivity analysis will 
utilize robust regression; this will be defined in the SAP.   
A Hochberg step- up procedure will be used to control type I error across 2 individual dose comparisons 
versus placebo for the primary endpoint . 
The 2 setanaxib treatment arms  also will be combined in a secondary analysis for ALP , fatigue , and liver 
stiffness. 
Safety Analysis: The Safety Analysis Set will be used for the analysis of safety data (AEs, including 
AESIs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, 12 -lead ECGs, and physical examination).

e Patients will be contacted by phone by study site staff at Weeks 16 and 20  to review AEs and any changes to concomitant medications. The  phone calls will be 
documented in the eCRF by the study site.  
f Eligibility to enter the Double -blind  Treatment Period will be determined during Visit  1 and, if required, Visit  2, with a final check before Randomization on 
Day 1.  
g A complete physical examination will be performed during Screening Visit  1 and at the Week  24 Visit (Visit 8). Patients who permanently discontinue IMP 
prior to or at the Week 24 Visit will have a complete physical examination at the EoT Visit. For Visits  2 to 7, when applicable, a symptoms -directed physical 
examination will be performed.  
h Liver stiffness measurements using transient elastography (FibroScan®) will be carried out in the morning in the fasting state and at predose.  
For assessments carried out on a different day  than the study visit, FibroScan® assessments can be performed on any day during the specified visit windows 
predose or postdose but always after a 3-hour fasting.  
During the Screening Period, the FibroScan® assessment can be performed on any day between 28 and 4 days prior to the Randomization/Baseline actual visit, 
after a 3-hour fasting. One repeat liver stiffness measurement can be performed within the Screening Period ( at Screening Visit 2 ) at the discretion of the 
Investigator for patients who do not meet the inclusion criterion at the initial screening assessment. FibroScan® images will be read locally.  
i Liver biochemistry: ALP, ALT, AST, total and conjugated bilirubin, and GGT. One repeat blood sampling (with analysis by the central laboratory) can be 
performed at the discretion of the Investigator at Screening Visit 2 for patients who do not meet the serum ALP inclusion criterion and/or who meet the total 
bilirubin and/or ALT/AST and/or TSH excl usion criteria at Screening Visit 1. The INR and creatinine are to be repeated in case the liver biochemistry test panel 
is taken at Screening Visit  2. 
j AMA titer, PBC -specific antibodies (anti -GP210, anti -SP100, and antibodies against major M2 components).  
k Viral serology: HIV antibodies (1 and 2) and, if positive for HIV antibodies, HIV RNA; hepatitis  B surface antigen and hepatitis  C virus antibodies  and, if 
positive for HCV antibody, HCV RNA . 
l A blood sample for the serum pregnancy test must be taken within 7 days of Day  1 (female patients of childbearing potential only). Therefore, if Screening 
Visit  1 is performed more than 7  days prior to Day  1, the serum pregnancy test must be repeated at Screening Visit  2 within 7  days of Day  1. 
m Hematology: hematocrit, hemoglobin, absolute and relative reticulocyte counts, RBC count, WBC count, differential WBC count, platelet count, 
absolute  neutrophil  count,  mean  cell volume,  and INR.  
Biochemistry: glucose, total protein, albumin, fibrinogen, c reatinine, urea, total cholesterol, triglycerides, sodium, potassium, and chloride.  
n Quantitative test for urine pH and protein; qualitative tests for glucose, ketones, bilirubin, blood, and microscopic examina tion of the sediment.  
o Patient questionnaires PROMIS sf -Fatigue 7b Daily and WI -NRS are completed at home every evening for 7 days prior to the site visits. PGIS and PGIC for 
fatigue and pruritus, respectively, are completed at home in the evening prior to the site visits.  
p Prior medication will be recorded during Screening only.

    1 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background 
1.1.1 Primary Biliary Cholangitis  
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis, is a 
liver disease caused by autoimmune (T -cell-mediated) attack on the small to medium 
intralobular bile ducts ( Selmi et  al 2011, Beuers  et al 2015) . A continuous assault on 
the bile duct epithelial cells leads to their gradual destruction and eventual disappearance (ie,  ductopenia). Once immune -mediated bile duct injury has been 
established, the disease progresses due to chronic cholestasis, secondary inflammation, and fibrosis, and may lead to liver cirrhosis and liver failure  (Kaplan  and 
Gershwin  2005, Lindor et al 2009) . The  reasons for the autoimmune attack are not well 
understood but may involve environmental triggers in genetically-susceptible individuals. 
The reported prevalence of PBC ranges from 20 to 400 cases per million of the 
population with some geographical differences  (Sood et  al 2004, Peters  et al 2007) . 
PBC is more common in women than men (9:1 ratio) and is mostly diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 60 years ( Myers  et al 2009, Hirschfield  et al 2013). 
Up to 60% of patients with PBC are asymptomatic at diagnosis . In these cases, PBC is  
detected through coincidental finding of abnormalities in liver biochemistry tests. The most common symptoms, where present, are fatigue and pruritus. Physical examination is often normal but, where present, common findings are: skin hyperpigmentation, jaundice, excoriations, xanthomata, xanthelasmas and, rarely, hepatosplenomegaly 
(Balasubramaniam  et al 1990, Poupon 2010, Levy  et al 2023). 
Common laboratory test abnormalities in patients with PBC include elevated alkaline 
phosphatase ( ALP ), antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), antinuclear antibodies, and 
hyperlipidemia. Other findings may include elevations in serum aminotransferases and bilirubin. Complications of PBC include cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, metabolic bone disease, and malabsorption ( EASL  2017). 
PBC is often associated (codiagnosed) with other autoimmune disorders including: Sjogren syndrome, autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis) and rheumatoid arthritis  (EASL 2017). 
1.1.1.1 Management and Treatment of Primary Biliary Cholangitis  
Management of patients with PBC consists of treatment of the underlying disease and management of its symptoms and complications, including pruritus, fatigue, xanthomata, hypercholesterolemia, vitamin deficiencies, anemia, malabsorption, osteoporosis, etc.  (EASL  2017). 
PBC is a progressive disease in most patients. The only widely accepted standard of 
care treatment is ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA). It is the only treatment recommended 
in guidelines issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver.

    Although there is currently no targeted treatment for the autoimmune injury to biliary 
epithe lial cells, in recent years, novel therapies targeting cholestasis have improved 
outcomes for many patients with PBC. UDCA and more recently obeticholic acid 
(OCA) have been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) and European 
Medicines Agency (EMA), for treatment of PBC.  
UDCA is a synthetic secondary bile acid, given orally at a dose of 1 3 to 15 mg/kg/day 
as first-line treatment for PBC. The following mechanisms of action may be involved 
in the beneficial therapeutic effects of UDCA in PBC and other cholestatic disorders: (a) increase in the hydrophilicity of circulating bile acids; (b) stimulation of hepatocellular and ductular secretions; (c) protection against cellular injury caused by bile acids and cytokines; (d)  some degree of immunomodulation and anti -inflammatory 
effects. Currently, treatment with UDCA represents the global standard of care  
(Selmi et  al 2011, Lindor et  al 2009;  EASL  2017 ; Lindor et  al 2020) , and can delay 
histologic progression ( Sood et  al 2004, Kaplan  and Gershwin 2005, Peters  et al 2007) 
and improve long- term survival ( Myers  et al 2009, Hirschfield  et al 2013) . However, 
UDCA is not a uniformly effective drug; there is little benefit to symptoms, and approximately 40% of PBC patients have a suboptimal response to UDCA  
(Corpechot et  al 2008, Rudic et  al 2012) . Patients with an inadequate response to 
UDCA (assessed biochemically), or those not tolerating UDCA, progress to cirrhosis and liver failure leading to liver transplant or death. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need in PBC patients with inadequate r esponse to UDCA.  
OCA is another synthetic secondary bile acid which has been approved by the FDA and 
EMA for treatment of PBC  (Invernizzi et  al 2015 ). OCA is indicated for the treatment 
of PBC in combination with UDCA in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. It has a similar mechanism of action as UDCA but has been shown to achieve further reduct ions in ALP levels in 
patients with inadequate response to UDCA. This additional anticholestatic effect was associated with a reduction in hepatocellular damage, as shown by decreases in aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) levels. 
However, OCA treatment achieved only small reductions in these markers of hepatocellular injury which failed to normalize to below the upper limit of normal (ULN)  reference range ( Nevens  et al 2016 ). Over time, this sustained hepatocellular 
injury likely contributes to progressive liver fibrosis and failure. Separately, OCA worsens the severity of pruritus, a key symptom of PBC which significantly impacts patients’ quality of life.  
The currently approved therapies mainly target cholestasis. However, there is a need 
for well  tolerated therapies able to  address additional components of the disease, 
including autoimmune injury to biliary endothelial  cells, bile acid -mediated 
hepatocellular injury, and fibrogenesis  (Dyson et  al 2015, Hirschfield  et al 2016). Also , 
there is a need to address symptomatic relief in patients  with PBC  eg, fatigue and 
pruritus ( Nevens  et al 2023).

    1.1.2 Setanaxib ( Investigational Medicinal Product) 
Setanaxib  (formerly GKT137831)  is a first -in-class inhibitor of the human protein 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH) oxidase (NOX) Isoforms  1 
and 4. It is a small organic molecule of low molecular weight and a  member of the 
pyrazolopyridine dione chemical class. 
The NOX family  is a set of transmembrane proteins ( Bedard and Krause  2007) . NOX 
enzymes require the stable assembly of transmembrane and cytosolic subunits. Upon 
assembly of a full enzymatic complex and activation by its substrates NADPH and molecular oxygen, NOX enzymes transport electrons through the cell membrane to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). In turn, ROS modulate multiple signaling pathways by oxidizing regulatory cysteine residues in target proteins. ROS can also 
cause other types of posttranslational modification of proteins and can target lipids and 
nucleic acids.  
When exaggerated in duration and/or magnitude, NOX activation participates in the pathogenesis of  a broad range of human diseases. In particular, the NOX1 and NOX4 
isoforms have been shown to play a key role in a broad range of fibrotic and 
inflammatory disorders ( Krause and Bedard  2008, Paik et al 2014, Liang  et al 2016, 
Teixeira et al 2016) . Importantly, studies have revealed that liver tissue expression of 
NOX1 and/or NOX4 is consistently elevated in patients with fibrotic liver diseases  
(Bettaieb  et al 2015, Lan  et al 2015). 
Setanaxib is being investigated in several fibrotic and inflammatory disorders, including PBC. Setanaxib’s mechanism of action (MoA) differs from that of 
anticholestatic agents, which are marketed (UDCA, OCA), in late- stage development 
(seladelpar, elafibranor), or increasingly used off -label (bezafibrate, fenofibrate). 
Specifically, setanaxib possesses broad antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects but 
does not modulate bile acid metabolism. Phase  2 results indicated that through this 
novel MoA, setanaxib achieves further reductions in markers of cholestatic injury (ALP, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase GGT ]), improves markers of liver fibrosis (liver 
stiffness, PRO -C3/C3M), and improves quality of life (fatigue and its social and 
emotional impact). These therapeutic benefits were substantially greater in patients with elevated liver stiffness at Baseline, a population at risk of disease progression. Compounds with novel MoAs are needed, particularly in patients at higher risk or in patients not responding or not tolerating anticholestatic therapies. 
1.1.3 Nonclinical Studies  
In Vitro  and In Vivo  Pha
 rmacology 
Detailed summaries for all studies are given in the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB).  
A set of in vitro  and in vivo  pharmacology studies have been conducted with setanaxib 
to support its proposed use as a NOX1/4 enzyme inhibitor for the treatment of fibrotic 
and inflammatory disorders including PBC. Investigation of potential effects against a 
broad range of receptors and enzymes confirmed that setanaxib demonstrated no significant off -target activity, except for significant inhibition of human recombinant

    15-lipoxygenase- 2. However, a review of available literature did not detect a safety 
concern.  
In in vitro  studies in isolated cells, setanaxib was shown to attenuate signaling evoked 
by a number of ligands known to induce and/or drive the fibrogenic process in multiple 
fibrogenic pathways, including TGF -β1 (transforming growth factor beta  1), PDGF  
(platelet -derived growth factor) , toll-like receptor  4 (TLR4 ), hedgehog, and angiotensin 
II (Lan et al 2015) . As a result, setanaxib  markedly reduced the induction of markers of 
myofibroblast activation, including αSMA  (smooth muscle actin alpha) , fibronectin, 
and procollagen I (Aoyama  et al 2012, Jiang  et al 2012). 
These direct antifibrogenic effects translate into antifibrotic activity in multiple in vivo  
models of liver fibrosis. Specifically, setanaxib  attenuated the development of liver 
fibrosis induced by experimental cholestasis (in the bile duct ligation and MDR2 [multiple drug resistance  2]-/- , mouse models). Setanaxib  also prevented liver fibrosis 
in models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH) (in the STAM [stelic animal model]  
and fast food diet models [ Jiang  et al 2012, Teixeira et  al 2014, Bettaieb  et al 2015]) 
and in toxic hepatitis (in  carbon tetrachloride [ CCL4 ]-induced liver injury 
[Aoyama et  al 2012]). Reduced in vivo  fibrogenesis was associated with a marked 
reduction in markers of myofibroblast activation. 
In addition, setanaxib  has shown potent anti -inflammatory effects in a number of 
biological settings, including metabolic and cholestatic liver injury. Specifically, 
setanaxib  prevented the induction of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines 
in CCL4 -induced liver injury and fast  food diet-induced NASH ( Bettaieb  et al 2015) . 
These effects on innate immunity resulted in a profound reduction of macrophage infiltration. Available data suggest that these anti -inflammatory effects are mediated 
through reduced activation of multiple pathways, including TLR4 and NF- κB (nuclear 
factor kappa B)  (Paik et al 2014) . In these studies, reduced liver inflammation was 
associated with a reduction in plasma levels of liver transaminases.  
In Vivo  and In Vitro  S
 afety Pharmacology and Toxicology 
To support clinical development of setanaxib via oral administration a series of safety pharmacology studies and a toxicity program designed in accordance with guidelines provided by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) were conducted with setanaxib. This included a standard battery of genotoxicity studies and repeat dose toxicity studies in 
the rat and dog of up to 26 weeks and 39 weeks duration, respectively. 
Setanaxib was shown to be devoid of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity and there are no 
relevant effects on fertility or embryonic/fetal development. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in rats was established at 
1000 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. The dog was the more sensitive species, and the NOAEL was established at 150  mg/kg/day in the 26- week dog study and 
300 mg/kg/day in the pivotal 39- week dog study. Treatment -related effects in the dog 
studies were confined to electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, decreased thyroid hormone

    levels, which in some animals correlated to thyroid follicular hypertrophy, and effects 
on the erythrocyte and reticulocyte counts indicative of effects on bone marrow. 
Cardiac disorders:  Setanaxib and its main active metabolite GKT138184 had no effect 
on the hERG channel, with an IC 50 of >300 μM. There was no significant inhibition of 
INa or I Ca with 100 μM of setanaxib or GKT138184. I Ks was inhibited 60% by 100 μM 
setanaxib and not significantly inhibited by 100 μM of the metabolite, GKT138184. 
Setanaxib and GKT138184 have no significant inhibitory activity on the I Kr cardiac ion 
channel at 300 μM.  
In dog studies, the chronic administration of setanaxib in the 500/300 mg/kg dose group 
was associated with reversible QT prolongation and atrioventricular -block events. 
Cardiovascular effects of setanaxib were examined in conscious dog s using radio 
telemetry. No effects of setanaxib at doses of up to 1000 mg/kg were observed on blood 
pressure, heart rate, RR, QRS , and PR intervals or on R  wave height, compared to the 
vehicle- treated group. Significant, but limited, increases in QT  interval were observed 
at 3 to 4 hours postdose in dogs receiving doses of 100 mg/kg or above in this conscious 
dog using telemetry study. QT/QTc intervals were evaluated at several time points in the 13- , 26- and 39- week dog studies. There were no indications of any ECG changes 
in the 13- week or 39 -week dog studies, in contrast to the 26- week study where variable 
changes in QTc intervals were limited to the earlier timepoints in the high est setanaxib  
dose group only (500/300 mg/kg). 
The variability of the changes in QT in time and in relation to dose and the lack of 
consistency within and between animals, the absence of treatment -related ECG 
alterations at both the NOAEL of 150 mg/kg/day and the highest tolerated dose of 300 mg/kg/day in the 26-week dog study, at the NOAEL of 300 mg/kg in the 39- week 
dog study, or at any of the doses tested in the already completed clinical studies , did 
not provide definitive information that setanaxib could prolong QT in a way that indicated a definitive risk to humans. 
Thyroid disorders:  Findings related to the thyroid, ie , decreased thyroxine ( T4) and 
increased thyroid- stimulating hormone ( TSH ), in some cases correlating with thyroid 
hypertrophy, seen in early toxicology studies in dogs were not replicated in the chronic 
toxicity studies, even though higher exposures were attained. No thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy or changes in thyroid hormones were observed at any dose level up to a dose of 300 mg/kg/day in either the 26-week or 39-week dog studies. 
Bone marrow disorders:  In dog toxicology studies, the administration of setanaxib in 
the ≥500/300 mg/kg dose group was associated with a reduction in erythroid precursors 
in the bone marrow, and reduced reticulocyte and red blood cell  (RBC) counts in 
peripheral blood, leading to severe aplastic anemia in 1 dog, which required euthanasia. 
By Week  5, ie , prior to the dose reduction from 500 to 300 mg/kg/day in the 26- week 
dog study, a marked decrease in reticulocyte count ( ∼90% decrease compared with 
pretest) was detected for 1 female dog. As per protocol, no further hematologic monitoring was conducted until Week 13, at which time reticulocyte  counts remained 
decreased and red cell parameters were markedly decreased. This time course indicates  
that setanaxib affected erythroid progenitors in 1 dog during the initial dosing period 
with 500 mg/kg. These findings may be due to a direct effect of setanaxib on erythroid

    progenitors because setanaxib was found to be cytotoxic in vitro  to hematopoietic 
BFU -E (burst -forming unit -erythroid) progenitor cells derived from canine bone 
marrow mononuclear cells. This effect was observed only at concentrations greater than 
10 μM. 
In addition, minor and reversible changes in total plasma bilirubin and other liver function te sts were observed but  were never associated with signs of hepatocellular 
injury or liver pathologies and as such were not considered to be adverse. 
1.1.4 Clinical Studies  
To date, 6 Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects (GSN000108, GSN000109, GSN000198, 
GSN000199, GSN000299, GSN000310), 2 Phase 2 studies (1 in patients with PBC [GSN000300], 1 in patients with Type  2 diabetes and albuminuria [GSN000200]) have 
been completed. A  Sponsor- led study with setanaxib in patients with r ecurrent or 
metastatic squamous c ell carcinoma of the head and neck (GSN000400) is ongoing. 
Ongoing Investigator -initiated studies are evaluating setanaxib in patients with Type  1 
diabetes and micro -album inuria ( Study GSN000241), and in patients with idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (Study GSN000341/Protocol No. IRB-300003198).  
Pharmacokinetics  
The Phase 1 studies have characterized the clinical pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability profile of single and multiple ascending doses of setanaxib and the main active metabolite GKT138184 in healthy subjects. 
No safety signals or dose -limiting toxicities have been identified up to a maximum 
single 1800 mg dose or repeated 800 mg twice daily (BID) dose (total daily dose of 
1600 mg) for 10 consecutive days. 
Potential food and drug interactions have been evaluated. Study GSN000310 assessed 
the effect of repeated setanaxib administration on the PK of selected cytochrome ( CYP ) 
450 isoenzyme CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and transporter substrates, including for OAT1 and OAT3 (organic anion transporters). 
Both setanaxib and its main active metabolite (GKT138184) exhibit approximate dose 
proportional PK across the dose ranges studied. Following both single and multiple dose administration of setanaxib across all doses studied, the main active metabolite exposure is consistently approximately 20% of the corresponding parent exposure. The PK for setanaxib and GKT138184 are similar. 
Setanaxib is rapidly absorbed after oral administration ( time to maximum concentration 
[t
max] between 0.5 and 3 h post dosing), with a tendency for later t max for both capsules 
and tablets when setanaxib is administered under fed conditions. Setanaxib dosed in the 
fasted state is typified by higher inter -subject variability in maximum concentration and 
area under the curve (AUC). Following single -dose administration of setanaxib tablets, 
estimates of setanaxib elimination half -life ranged from approximately 8 to 14 h, and 9 
to 12 h for the main active metabolite GKT138184. Modest accumulation of both setanaxib and GKT138184 were observed on repeated BID administration of the tablet

 Confidential   
    formulation (for 1200 and 1600 mg total daily doses), with steady state Day 8 exposures 
ranging from 2 to 30% higher than corresponding exposures on Day 1.  
The main routes of the primary metabolism of setanaxib appear to be uridine 5'-diphospho- glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT ) 1A9 to GKT289993 (N -
glucuronide) and via CYP3A4, principally to the main active metabolite GKT138184 (product of demethylation). Therefore, strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and UGT1A9 may affect the plasma exposures of setanaxib. 
Setanaxib has been shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 at the 
800 mg BID dose in healthy subjects, increasing the AUC of sensitive probe substrates by 45% and 60%, respectively. 
Setanaxib has been shown to be a weak inhibitor of OAT3 at the 800 mg BID dose in 
healthy subjects, increasing the AUC of a sensitive probe substrate by 33%. 
Efficacy in Patients with PBC (Protocol GSN000300) 
This completed Phase  2 proof of concept study was an international double -blind, 
randomized, placebo- controlled clinical study to assess the efficacy and safety of oral 
setanaxib in patients with PBC, persistently elevated ALP, and elevated levels of GGT 
who were receiving UDCA. The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the percent GGT reduction from B aseline to Week  24. Secondary efficacy endpoints included ALP 
changes, liver stiffness measured by transient elastography (FibroS can
®) and quality of 
life. Statistical significance for all endpoints at Week  24 was set at p<0. 047 for the first 
dose level tested and 0.023 for the 2nd dose level tested , according to the Hochberg 
adjustment method for multiple analyses. A total of 111 eligible patients were randomized to setanaxib (400 mg once daily [OD]  or 400 mg BID) or placebo 
according to 1:1:1 randomization ratio for a total of 24 weeks.  
At Week  24, GGT reductions were -8 % for placebo, -5% for setanaxib 400 mg OD, 
and - 19% for setanaxib 400 mg BID. These changes did not achieve statistical 
significance at Week  24, although statistical significance had been achieved at the 
6-week interim efficacy analysis (p<0.01 for setanaxib 400 mg BID versus  placebo). 
For the 400 mg BID dose, the mean percent change from B aseline in serum GGT was 
maintained at around - 19% from Week 12 to Week 24. 
A statistically significant reduction in overall treatment effect was also observed for ALP  levels (p=0.002) over the course of the Double-blind T reatment Period. At 
Week  24, setanaxib 400 mg BID achieved meaningful reductions in ALP. Changes 
were -3% for placebo, − 10% for setanaxib 400 mg OD, and -13% for setanaxib 400 mg 
BID (p<0.049 versus placebo). There was a statistically significant change in ALP 
versus B aseline for the setanaxib 400 mg BID of -16% observed at 6 weeks . No changes 
were observed for total bilirubin (+11% for placebo, +5% for 400 mg OD, and +15% 
for setanaxib 400 mg BID). On the composite endpoint of serum ALP <1.67xULN, 
ALP decrease >15%, and total bilirubin <ULN, the  response rates at Week  24 were 5% 
for placebo, 18% for setanaxib 400 mg OD, and 25% for setanaxib 400 mg BID . 
Median percent changes in valid liver stiffness measurements in the intention -to-treat 
analysis set were +4.1% for placebo, +1.4% for setanaxib 400 mg OD, and −4.9% for

    setanaxib 400 mg BID. Patients with advanced liver fibrosis at B aseline (predefined 
population of patients with liver stiffness ≥9.6 kPa), experienced greater absolute 
reductions in median liver stiffness from B aseline following 24 weeks of setanaxib 400 
mg BID ( –3.0 kPa) compared with modest reductions following 24 weeks of setanaxib 
400 mg OD (−1.0 kPa) or placebo treatment (−0.7 kPa), corresponding to mean 
percentage reductions of −16%, −5% , and +4% , respectively (p=0.11 for setanaxib 400 
mg BID versus placebo). 
The posthoc analyses of the percent change from Baseline to Week  24 in serum GGT 
and ALP by B aseline liver stiffness subgroup showed that patients with elevated liver 
stiffness at B aseline who received the setanaxib 400 mg BID dose achieved greater 
mean reductions in serum GGT and ALP at Week  24 ( −32.4% and −24.3%, 
respectively) than those with normal or marginally elevated liver stiffness at B aseline 
(−12.9%  and −8.7%, respectively).  
At Week 24, patients treated with setanaxib 400  mg BID reported greater mean 
(standard error of mean ) absolute reductions from B aseline in PBC -40 fatigue domain 
score (–3.6 [1.3] ) versus those receiving setanaxib 400 mg OD (–0.8 [ 1.0]) or placebo 
(0.6 [0.9] ). Similar observations were made across all PBC-40 domains except itch. In 
the setanaxib 400 mg BID arm, patients with moderate  to severe fatigue at Baseline had 
a greater reduction in mean fatigue score at W eek 24 (–5.8 [2.1] ) versus those with mild 
fatigue (–0.6 [0.9] ); results were similar across all domains. Reduced fatigue was 
correlated with emotional, social, symptom, and cognitive improvements. The analysis of the percent change from B aseline to Week  24 in PBC -40 questionnaire 
showed a statistically significant improvement for the 400  mg BID dose ( versus 
placebo) in the fatigue, social , and emotional domains (p- values equal to 0.027, 0.003, 
and 0.031, respectively).  
The analysis of the percent change from B aseline to Week  24 in pruritus score (using a 
visual analogue scale [ VAS ]) showed a statistically significant reduction for the 400 mg 
OD dose (p-value=0.004) versus placebo. For the 400 mg BID dose, the difference 
versus placebo is not statistically significant ( p-value=0.103). 
Safety  
In patients with PBC, setanaxib exhibited a favorable safety profile throughout the 24-
week Double-blind T reatment Period. No dropouts or treatment interruptions due to 
pruritus or fatigue were reported. Only 2 serious adverse events ( SAEs ) were reported, 
a case of Grade 1 urinary infection requiring hospitalization in the placebo group and a case of multiple bone fractures related to a traffic accident in the setanaxib 400  mg BID 
group. Both cases were deemed unrelated to study drug by the Investigators. A  review 
of adverse events ( AEs), safety laboratory results, vital signs, physical examination, 
and ECG did not identify any safety signals associated with setanaxib at 400 mg OD or 
400 mg BID . 
The safety signals identified in toxicology studies (see Section  1.1.3) have not been 
detected in the completed clinical studies to date. Specifically, there was no evidence 
of drug effect on thyroid function, bone marrow function, or cardiac conduction:

    Thyroid disorders:  In clinical studies of setanaxib completed to date, there has been 
no evidence of thyroid disorders related to setanaxib exposure.  
Bone marrow disorders: In clinical studies of setanaxib completed to date, there has 
been no evidence of bone marrow toxicity related to setanaxib exposure.  
Cardiac disorders:  In clinical studies  of setanaxib completed to date , there has been 
no evidence of clinically relevant changes in ECGs associated with setanaxib, including 
QT prolongation.  
In th is ongoing study, TRANS FORM  GSN000350 ( data cutoff of 21 August 2023), 
there was 1 SAE of QTc prolongation that occurred in a patient with atrial fib rillation. 
The inves tigational medicinal product ( IMP) was discontinued and the patient remained 
asymptomatic throughout the event duration. 
Liver disorders:  In clinical studies of setanaxib completed to date, there have been 
no cases of hepatic disorders related to  setanaxib exposure.  
In the ongoing TRANS FORM GSN000350 study ( data cutoff of 21 August 2023), there 
have been 4 SAEs  in 4 patients  associated with mild elevation in liver blood test results 
that were considered possibly related to the IMP . These 4 SAE s of elevated liver blood 
test results were the only SAEs  of hepatic disorders that were considered related to the 
IMP in the entire setanaxib clinical program to date. All 4 patients with elevated liver 
blood test results discontinued IMP and remained asymptomatic throughout the period 
of the abnormal liver laboratory results.

1.2 Study Rationale 
PBC is a chronic disease and w ithout effective treatment it is often  progress ive, leading  
to cirrhosis and liver failure, resulting in  liver transplantation or death ( EASL  2017).  
This study is being conducted in order to determine  the effect of setanaxib on 
biochemical response  based on ALP and fatigue in patients with PBC , elevated liver 
stiffness , and intolerance or inadequate response to UDCA . Intolerance to UDCA is 
defined as patients unable to tolerate the full -labeled dose of UDCA in PBC 
(13-15 mg/kg) due to frequently reported gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea 
and abdominal pain. This study will assess the decrease in ALP with daily dose s of 1200 mg and 1600 mg 
versus placebo, whereas the previous PBC setanaxib Phase 2 study (GSN000300) 
investigated  daily doses of 400 mg and  800 mg versus placebo.  
Since the initia l study design, there has been a significant evolution in the management 
of patients with PBC. In particular, the use of second- line therapies such as OCA 
(Ocaliva) and fibrates (eg, bezafibrate) has expanded, and a significant proportion of 
patients  who are intolerant or nonresponders to UDCA  are able to receive dual or triple 
therapy (ie, UDCA plus OCA and/ or a fibrate). As a consequence, there appears to have 
been  a general reduction in the level of disease activity  observed in patients being

 Confidential   
    considered for enrolment in the study (allowing for patients on dual or triple therapy), 
as judged by lower levels of ALP. This has likely decreased the available study population and consequently the rate of enrolment of patients into the study.  
Based on the observed low enrolment rate, Calliditas does not consider it feasible to 
complete the study in its current format within a reasonable timeframe. It is nevertheless acknowledged that there is preliminary evidence of beneficial effects of setanaxib on important clinical aspects of PBC, including ALP, fatigue and related social and cognitive manifestations ( Invernizzi et  al 2023). Despite the evolution in the 
therapeutic approach to PBC, there still remain significant unmet needs, in particular with respect to quality of life outcomes such as fatigue, as this is typically unaffected by existing therapies ( Jones  et al 2023).  
Calliditas has therefore decided to amend the  protocol changing the study from the 
current Phase 2b/3 study to a 24-week Phase 2b study of 60 to 70 patients to enable an earlier assessment of the safety and efficacy of setanaxib with the two doses (1600   mg 
and 1200 mg) versus placebo. With this amended design there is no longer a need for an interim analysis for the assessment of futility and dose selection for a Phase 3 
portion, as this is removed. Consequently, the 52-w eek Extension Phase Treatment 
Perio d has been removed. 
Given the revision to a Phase 2b study, it is of scientific relevance to focus on an 
individual endpoint only. Therefore, rather than the originally planned composite endpoint consisting of change in ALP and total bilirubin, the primary endpoint has been amended to evaluate the individual endpoint of change in ALP. The secondary endpoints of change in fatigue  and liver stiffness  are retained , as is the composite 
endpoint of changes in markers of cholestasis . 
The reduced duration of study treatment from 52 weeks to 24 weeks in combination with the change from a composite primary endpoint to an individual primary endpoint (change in ALP) with fatigue as a secondary endpoint  is supported by the preliminary  
evidence obtained in the Phase 2 study in patients with PBC (GSN000300) as detailed 
in Section 1.1.4. This study showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
changes in the  above mentioned endpoints after 24 weeks of treatment . This is in line 
with a retrospective investigation , which concluded that measuring ALP at 6  months is 
of clinical relevance ( Murillo  Perez et  al 2023). 
As consequence of the change in primary endpoint, the assumptions for the sample size 
have been revisited: with approximately 16 evaluable patients per arm ( 48 patients 
overall),  there will be >80% power to detect a >25% reduction in ALP in setanaxib-
treated patients versus a 2.5% reduction in the placebo arm with a 2-sided p<0.05. For 
the secondary endpoint of change in fatigue, there will be >80% power to detect a 20% reduction in fatigue versus a 2.5% increase in the placebo arm. A dropout rate of approximately 25% leads to a target sample size of 66 patients (22 per arm). A range 
of approximately 60 to 70 pat ients  allow s for variability in the assumed dropout rate.   
In combination, the revision of treatment duration , primary endpoint , and sample size 
has statistical validity and an acceptable probability of detecting clinically meaningful changes in ALP and fatigue. During the analysis, t he benefit -risk profile of each

 Confidential   
    setanaxib dose will be assessed and compared to determine the optimal dose for further 
development.  
Given the changes to endpoints , study duration, and statistical analysis of the study, the 
study will no longer support a direct application for approval in PBC. Rather, the final analysis will permit an assessment of the development pathway for setanaxib in PBC, which will potentially  focus on quality of life outcomes such as fatigue. T he amended 
study no longer has an adaptive component and no part of it can be considered Phase 3 
in development stage. The description of the study is therefore amended from Phase 2b/3 to Phase 2b. G iven that the revisions may allow the 2 doses of setanaxib to 
be distinguished, it is considered feasible that only 1 additional study may be required 
for regulatory approval.  It should be noted that patients, Investigators, and the Sponsor 
have remained blind to randomi zed treatment  and no unblinded data have been 
reviewed prior to this amendment. 
Details  regarding the rationale for setanaxib dose selection are provided in 
Section  3.2.1. 
1.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Potential Benefits  
Patients included in this study will have PBC with elevated liver stiffness, despite 
treatment with first- line and potentially second-line treatments for PBC. Participation 
in this study provides the patient with a potential opportunity to take setanaxib, which is being evaluated for efficacy in this clinical study . Patients included in the study will 
have a 2/3 chance of receiving setanaxib. While NOX1/4 inhibition represents an attractive therapeutic strategy in patients with PBC, therapeutic benefits in patients with PBC have yet to be demonstrated. 
During this study patients will undergo the regular medical evaluations and assessments 
for PBC, as part of the study procedures. 
Potential Risks  
As summarized in Section  1.1.3 and Section  1.1.4, setanaxib has been extensively 
investigated in nonclinical and clinical studies. In the completed Phase 1 and Phase  2 studies, the safety profile of setanaxib has been 
shown to be favorable, with no clinical safety signal and no dose -limiting toxicity 
identified (see Section  1.1.4). The safety signals identified in the toxicology studies 
(thyroid function, ECG abnormalities, hematological changes) have been carefully 
monitored in all clinical studies completed to date. No treatment -related clinical or 
pathological findings have been observed, irrespective of dose, treatment duration or type of clinical study. 
The doses of setanaxib under investigation in this study are 1200 mg/day and 
1600 mg/day. The highest dose regimen to be evaluated in this study constitutes a dose doubling compared to the previous study in patients with PBC where there were no safety signals of concern ( see the setanaxib dose rationale and justification of safety

 Confidential   
    margins in Section  3.2.1 ). Due to the higher setanaxib doses being evaluated in the 
current study, there is a potential risk of new safety signals that have not been observed 
to date in the previous clinical studies . Patients  included in this study will undergo 
regular safety assessments . In addition, given the findings from the toxicology studies 
(see Section  1.1.3), and the characteristics of the disease, appropriate exclusion criteria 
and safety endpoints for regular monitoring have been built into this study as 
precautions. 
• Thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism) : Patients with TSH levels >ULN at Screening 
will be excluded from this clinical study. The levels of TSH and free T4 will be 
regularly monitored during the study. In the case of TSH ≥10 mIU/L, IMP administration will be interrupted while the patient undergoes evaluation for hypothyroidism. 
• Bone marrow disorders (a nemia ): Patients with a history of bone marrow disorder, 
including aplastic anemia, or any current marked anemia defined as hemoglobin 
<10.0 g/dL will be excluded from the study. Reticulocyte counts will be regularly monitored during the study. In case of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events ( CTCAE ) Grade ≥2 anemia,  IMP administration will be interrupted while 
the patient undergoes further evaluation. 
• Cardiac disorders: Patients with certain cardiac conduction abnormalities as well as patients with a second - or third- degree atrioventricular block will be excluded from 
the study. Patients included in the study will undergo regular monitoring for evidence of cardiac disorders by 12- lead ECGs. If the patient develops a QT 
prolongation (QTc Fridericia interval > 450 milliseconds for males and 
>470 milliseconds for females ), or an increase in QTc greater than 60  milliseconds 
from Baseline, whichever comes firs t, or if the patient develops other severe cardiac 
conditions per the Investigator’s judgment, the IMP will be discontinued. 
• Liver disorders (DILI): Patients with total bilirubin >2×ULN and/or plasma ALT and/or AST >3×ULN will be excluded from the study. Liver biochemistry tests will be regularly monitored during the study. As noted in Appendix II , if prespecified 
levels of AST, ALT, total  bilirubin, or international normalized ratio (INR) are met 
during the study, IMP  administration will be interrupted while the patient undergoes 
further evaluation. 
Drug -induced liver injury (DILI), anemia, and hypothyroidism will be AEs  of special 
interest ( [AESIs ], see Section  7.1.5) in this study and will be reported within 24 hours 
of the Investigator becoming aware of the event.  
An Adjudication Committee will remain blinded to patient treatment assignment and will adjudicate the AESIs and the adverse clinical outcomes (see Section 5.4). An 
unblinded Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will oversee the safety of participating patients. The IDMC will regularly review an aggregated list of events adjudicated by the Adjudication Committee (see S ection  9.4).  
The medications being taken by a patient will be carefully evaluated by the Investigator before the patient is enrolled into the study, and concomitant medications will be

    recorded throughout the study. The main routes of the primary metabolism of setanaxib 
appear to be UGT1A9 to GKT289993 (N -glucuronide) and via CYP3A4, principally to 
the main active metabolite GKT138184 (product of demethylation). Therefore, strong 
inhibitors and inducers of UGT1A9 or CYP3A4 may affect the plasma exposures of setanaxib. Setanaxib is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and OAT3. 
In vitro , setanaxib inhibited breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and MDR1 
(P-glycoprotein) and also suggests that setanaxib is an inducer of CYP2B6.  
Therefore,  setanaxib may  increase the plasma concentration of drugs which are 
primarily eliminated through  these enzymes and transporters . Caution should be 
exercised during concomitant use of the drug with setanaxib. Based on a literature 
search, and nonclinical and clinical safety data, it is the Sponsor’s position that 
setanaxib does not have immunosuppressive properties. All approved C OVID -19 
vaccines are allowed in setanaxib studies. It is important that the C OVID- 19 
vaccinations are not delayed. At least one -third  of patients included in this study will not receive setanaxib. 
Therefore, there is a risk of disease progression without the possibility of trying any 
other new potential treatments for PBC. 
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits , risks , and reasonably 
expected AEs of setanaxib  can be found in the IB. 
Considering the measures taken to minimize risk to the patien ts participating in this 
study, the potential risks identified in association with setanaxib  are justified by the 
anticipated benefits that may be afforded to patients with PBC.

    3 STUDY PLAN 
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This study is a randomized, placebo- controlled, double -blind, parallel -group, 
multicenter, Phase 2b  study assessing oral setanaxib administered as an add-on therapy 
in patients with PBC, elevated liver stiffness, and intolerance or inadequate response to 
UDCA. The safety and efficacy of 1200 mg/day and 1600 mg/day setanaxib will be assessed against matching placebo over  24 weeks of treatment. It is planned to enroll 
approximately 60 to 70 patients at 80 to 130 investigational centers in North America, 
Europe, Israel,  Australia, and New Zealand.  
The study design is outlined in Figure 1 (Study Schematic) , and the visit schedule and 
planned assessments at each visit are detailed in Table 1. 
The study will consist of a 4- week  Screening P eriod, a 24- week  Double-blind 
Treatment Period , and a 4-week  Follow-up P eriod. The total duration of the study for 
patien ts remaining in the study until their final follow -up assessment 
(End-of-Treatment [EoT] Visit 30 days after the last IMP dose) will be approximately 
32 weeks (approximately 8 months). The Investigator will obtain signed informed consent from the patien t before any study 
procedures are performed. For further details regarding the informed consent process, 
see Section 9.3. Patients will be assessed for eligibility during the Screening Period . 
All patients will attend Screening Visit 1. If liver biochemistry (see Footnote  i of 
Table 1) and/or serum pregnancy (see Footnote  l of Table 1) retests are required, 
patients will attend Screening Visit 2. Screening Visit  1 and, if required , Screening 
Visit 2 should be completed within 4 weeks prior to Randomization. If required, Screening Visit  2 should be conducted by Day -4. 
At a subset of study sites that accept referral patients or where sparse transient elastography (FibroScan
®) assessments are standard  of care , a pre -Screening visit 
including local laboratory liver function tests and transient elastography can be performed to assess patient eligibility. The Investigator will then obtain signed pre -
screening consent. Data obtained at a pre-Screening visit cannot be re -used for 
screening. Full standard screening must be repeated for patient enrol lment. 
Eligible patients will be randomized to oral setanaxib 1200 mg /day, 1600 mg /day, or 
placebo, according to a 1:1:1 randomization ratio, stratified by Screening  serum 
ALP  < or ≥3.0×ULN. See Section  6.3 for further details on the method of assigning 
patien ts to the treatment groups, and see Section  6.4 for further details on the dose and 
administration of setanaxib and placebo. 
Baseline assessments will be performed on Day 1 (Visit 3). Post -Baseline assessments 
will be performed at Week s 2 (Visit 4), 4 (Visit  5), 8 (Visit 6), 12 (Visit  7), and 
24 (Visit 8). In addition, study patients will be contacted by phone by the study site 
staff at Weeks 16  and 20.

 Confidential   
    Special Note:  Patients who are following the previous protocol schedule (protocol 
version 4) and are already beyond Week  24 should permanently discontinue IMP as 
soon as possible and have an EoT Visit 30  days after their last dose. 
Following permanent IMP discontinuation at any time during the study, patients will 
undergo a
n EoT Visit 30 days after their last dose. If IMP is permanently discontinued, 
the study assessments should continue until completion of the Week  24 Visit (Visit 8). 
If it is not feasible to complete all the visits , every possible effort should be made to 
complete the Week 24 Visit . 
The Investigator, the site personnel, the Sponsor and their representatives involved in 
monitoring and conducting the study, and the patien ts will be blinded to treatment 
assignments until the database is locked and the study is unblinded for analysis (see 
Section 6.2). Also s ee Section 6.2 for details on access to the treatment codes in the 
event of emergency unblinding. 
If applicable, patients will continue UDCA, OCA, and bezafibrate or fenofibrate 
treatment at a stable dose during the Double-blind Treatment Period. Patients should 
not start additional treatments for PBC after Randomization. All medications will be 
recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
Throughout the study, particular attention will be given to the detection and 
management of AESIs, suspected cases of DILI (see Section  5.3.2.1 and Appendix II), 
potential cases of bone marrow toxicity (see Section  5.3.2.2) , and potential cases of 
hypothyroidism (see Section  5.3.2.3). 
The IDMC will oversee the safety of participating patients (see Section  9.4.2). The role 
and responsibilities of the IDMC will be outlined in an IDMC Charter. An Adjudication Committee, who will remain blinded to patient treatment assignment, will adjudicate the AESIs  and the adverse clinical outcomes (see Section  9.4.1). The roles and 
responsibilities of the Adjudication Committee will be outlined in an Adjudication Charter.  
3.2 Discussion of Study Design  
This study will be randomized, placebo -controlled, and double -blinded. Study 
randomization will prevent bias in treatment allocation. In addition, stratification  by 
Screening  serum ALP will help to ensure that the treatment groups are balanced in 
terms of population characteristics, thereby minimizing factors that could confound the interpretation of study results. The double -blinding of the study with regard to setanaxib 
and placebo treatment assignments will minimize bias in the assessment of treatment effect.  Although Investigators are blinded to treatment assignments, the Investigators 
will review the laboratory reports, which will include ALP, the primary endpoint parameter , and bilirubin. It is acknowledged that access to the values might essentially 
unblind the Investigators to the treatment assignment of their patients. However, knowledge of ALP and bilirubin is required to inform the appropriate medical management of the patient from a  safety perspective.  
The patients included in this study will have  PBC with  elevated liver stiffness, 
despite treatment with first- line, and potentially second- line, treatments for PBC.

 Confidential   
    All patients included in this study will continue treatment on their stable prescriptional 
dose of UDCA, unless the patient is intolerant to UDCA. Second- line therapies for PBC 
are also permitted  for patients who have been on a stable dose for >3 months prior to 
Screening . Therefore,  setanaxib or placebo will be given as add- on therapy to first 
and/or second- line therapies . Due to the lack of alternative effective treatments for this 
population of patients with PBC, a placebo- controlled study design is most  appropriate. 
The doses of setanaxib under investigation in this study are 1200 mg/day and 
1600 mg/day. The highest dose regimen to be evaluated in this study constitutes a dose 
doubling compared to the previous study in patients with PBC where there were no safety signals of concern. Please refer to Section  3.2.1 for the setanaxib dose rationale 
and justification of safety margins.  
Management of patients with PBC includes monitoring of laboratory parameters (including ALP, bilirubin, AST, albumin, and platelet count) and elastography (EASL  2017). Abnormally high ALP levels typically occur in patients with PBC,  and 
ALP values are associated with disease progression ( EASL  2017). Bilirubin is a 
prognostic marker of a poor outcome in patients with PBC and is generally elevated at late stages of the disease ( EASL  2017). Patients included in this study will have an ALP 
level ≥1.67×ULN and a total bilirubin level of ≤2×ULN at Screening. If the total 
bilirubin elevation is >ULN at Screening, the albumin level must be within the reference range. 
This Phase 2b study has as the primary endpoint change in ALP (%), with daily doses 
of 1200 mg and 1600 mg versus placebo, whereas the previous PBC setanaxib Phase 2 
study (GSN000300) investigated daily doses of 400 mg and 800 mg versus placebo . A 
central laboratory analyzes the levels of ALP and other laboratory parameters in order 
to standardize the analysis methodology and minimize sources of error from samples taken at the different study sites.  
The feasibility to conduct a study within an acceptable time frame under an adaptive 
Phase 2b/3Phase 2b study design, has prove d challenging. This is considered to be 
related to new and more frequently used treatment options, which the study (all protocol versions) allows for, such as OCA and off -label use of bezafibrates . One consequence 
of this is that fewer patients than anticipated are meeting the inclusion criteria of ALP ≥1.67×ULN  or liver stiffness  ≥8.0 kPa. Therefore, the study design is revised to a 
Phase 2b study, with the primary objective to assess the decrease in ALP. Please also 
see S ection 1.2. 
Patients included in this study will have an EoT Visit 30 days after the last dose of IMP.  
Cholestasis often manifests with symptoms including fatigue and pruritus , which are 
significant causes of impaired quality of life  (EASL  2017) . In this study, fatigue  and 
pruritus will be assessed as secondary endpoint s. A structured approach to quantify 
fatigue and pruritus will be undertaken through the completion of validated questionnaires. 
Safety  is being assessed in this study as a secondary endpoint. The safety assessments 
included in this study are standard.

    3.2.1 Setanaxib Dose Rationale and Justification of Safety Margins 
Given the experience of nonclinical and clinical data, the  present study is designed to 
show efficiency in a safely conducted study. 
In the completed Phase 1 and Phase  2 studies, the safety profile of setanaxib has been 
shown to be favorable, with no clinical safety signal and no dose -limiting toxicity 
identified.  
The previous clinical study in patients  with PBC  (GSN000300) evaluated setanaxib 
400 mg BID for 24 weeks. This dosing regimen was considered safe and well tolerated, 
but the observed clinical efficacy was considered insufficient. Therefore , there is an 
interest in studying higher doses up to 800 mg BID for 24 weeks . 
The highest dose regimen to be evaluated in this study constitutes a dose doubling compared to the previous study in patients with PBC  where there were no safety signals 
of concern. Although the expected exposures will be around the defined NOAEL for 
both the parent (setanaxib) and the main active metabolite  (GKT138184) , all the 
NOAEL defining toxicology signals can and will be monitored and were not observed 
neither in the healthy volunteers at 800 mg BID for 8  days or patients at 400 mg BID 
for 24  weeks.  
For the proposed maximal dose ( setanaxib 800 mg BID [total daily dose 1600 mg] ), 
toxicology studies in the dog, the most sensitive species , provide a safety margin  of ≥1, 
when the combined concentration of setanaxib and its main active metabolite (GKT138184) is considered. The safety margin  for setanaxib alone is also  ≥1. However,  
for the main active metabolite GKT138184, the safety margin  is calculated to be 0.7. 
Refer to the Setanaxib Investigator Brochure for further details on the safety margins. 
Given the findings from the toxicology studies  and the characteristics of the disease, 
appropriate exclusion criteria and safety endpoints for regular monitoring have been 
built into this study, as precautions . Please refer to Section  1.3 for further details.  
3.3 End of Study

c. Historical liver biopsy consistent with PBC. 
4. Serum ALP ≥1.67×ULN at S creening.  
One repeat blood sampling (with analysis by the central laboratory) can be 
performed at the discretion of the Investigator at Screening Visit  2 for patients who 
do not meet this inclusion criterion at Screening Visit 1. If this inclusion criterion 
is then met at Screening Visit 2, the patient may be eligible for the study. 
5. Liver stiffness measured by transient elastography (FibroScan
®) of ≥8.0 kPa and an 
interquartile range over median ratio (IQR/med) of ≤30% at Screening, are taken 
with the results expressed in kilopascals [kPa]). 
One repeat liver stiffness measurement can be performed within the Screening 
Period at the discretion of the Investigator for patients who do not meet the inclusion criterion at the initial screening assessment. If the inclusion criterion is then met, the patient may be eligible for the study. 
6. UDCA prescriptional dose use for the past 6 months (at a stable dose for >3 months prior to Screening) OR intolerant to UDCA (last dose of UDCA >3 months prior to Screening). Intolerance to UDCA is defined as patients unable to tolerate the full -

performed at Screening Visit 2  for patients who do not meet the serum ALP inclusion 
criterion and/or who meet the INR, TSH, total bilirubin and/or ALT/AST exclusion criteria at Screening Visit  1 at the I nvestigator’s discretion, if the Investigator believes 
that the result was spurious, confounded, or not in line with the historical values of the patient . In these cases, the repeat assessment is allowed without the patient being 
considered a screen failure. Screening Period extensions of up to 7 days may be considered on a case-by-case basis, if agreed by the Investigator and Medical Monitor. 
Patients who are screen failures may undergo full rescreening once at the discretion of 
the Investigator if there is a reasonable expectation that the patient is potentially eligible 
for the study. In these cases, the rescreened patient should be assigned a new unique screening number. A second full rescreening at the discretion of the Investigator if there 
is a reasonable expectation and rationale provided that the patient is potentially eligible for the study can be done if agreed by the Medical Monitor. Again, the rescreened 
patient should be assigned a new unique screening number. 
4.4 Premature Discontinuation  
4.4.1 Premature Discontinuation of Investigational Medicinal Product 
Patient s should discontinue the IMP if any of the following occurs: 
1. The patient  withdraws his/her consent to participate in the study. 
2. The patient  develops an illness that would interfere with his/her continued 
participation in the study, at the Investigator’s discretion. 
3. The patient  is noncompliant with study procedures or medication, which in the 
opinion of the Investigator , impacts patient safety and/or the integrity of the study 
results . 
4. The patien t takes prohibited medication  that warrants the IMP discontinuation at 
the discretion of the Investigator. The introduction of any standard of care PBC 
treatment (OCA, fenofibrate, or bezafibrate) is allowed, but warrants IMP discontinuation (see Section  6.7). Dose modifications of concomitant PBC 
treatments initiated before Randomization do not require IMP discontinuation. 
5. The patien t is confirmed to be pregnant. 
6. The Sponsor or regulatory agency requests withdrawal of the patien t. 
7. The patient has suspected drug-induced liver injury (sDILI) meeting Criteria C  in 
Appendix II. 
8. The patient has CTCAE Grade ≥2 a nemia  AND  the retest absolute reticulocyte 
count is below 50% of the Baseline value, IMP will not be resumed and will be 
permanently discontinued.

    9. The patient has a retest TSH level of ≥10  mIU/ L if overt biological hypothyroidism 
is confirmed (ie, TSH ≥10 mIU/L and reduced free T4 ) (see  Section  5.3.2.3). 
10. The patient has one or more adverse clinical outcome listed in Section  5.4. 
11. The patient has a severe cardiac condition per the Investigator’s judgment, QT 
prolongation (QTc Fridericia interval >450 milliseconds  for males and  
>470 milliseconds for females), or an increase in QTc greater than 60  milliseconds 
from B aseline, whichever comes first.  
Patients who permanently discontinue IMP prior to completion of the Week  24 Visit 
(Visit 8) will have an EoT Visit 30  days after the last IMP dose, after which every 
possible effort should be made to complete the Week 24 study assessments (Visit 8)  
(see Table 1).  
Patients  who discontinue IM P prematurely will not be replaced.  
4.4.2 Premature Discontinuation from the Study  
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary. A patien t has the right to withdraw from 
the study at any time for any reason, without any reprisal. 
The Investigator has the right to terminate participation of a patien t for any of the 
following reasons: 
• Violation of the protocol jeopardizing patient safety and/or integrity of study results  
• Any other reason relating to the patient's safety 
• Any other reason relating to the integrity of the study data 
Investigators should make every effort to discuss with the study monitor/Sponsor 
before discontinuing a patient from the study; it should be considered if IMP discontinuation, with completion of the Week  24 Visit (Visit 8) may be  appropriate (see 
Section  4.4.1).  
If a patien t is withdrawn from the study, the study monitor/ Sponsor will be informed 
immediately. If there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the patien t will remain under 
the supervision of the Investigator until satisfactory health has returned. 
If the patien t withdraws consent for disclosure of further information, the S ponsor may 
retain and continue to use any collected data before such a withdrawal of consent. If a 
patien t withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records. 
Although a patien t is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing prematurely 
from a study, the I nvestigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), 
while fully respecting the patient 's rights.

 Confidential   
    At the time of premature study discontinuation, the Investigator should make every 
effort to ensure the patien t completes the assessments indicated at the EoT Visit, which 
will be the End of Study ( EoS) Visit for the patient; see Table 1. 
Patient s who prematurely discontinue from the study cannot subsequently rejoin the 
study. 
For details on the discontinuation of study sites or the study as a whole, see Section  14. 
4.4.3 Lost to Follow- up 
A patien t will be considered lost to follow -up if he/she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a patient  fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon 
as possible, counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the patient wishes to and/or should continue 
in the study. 
• Before a patient is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator (or designee) must 
make every effort to regain contact with the patient (where possible, at least 2  phone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address 
or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical notes.  
• Should the patient continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.

    5 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
Refer to Table 1 for the schedule of assessments.  
Patients will be asked to fast from 10  pm on t he day prior to study visits until after the 
study procedures have been completed. Patients will be reminded to bring the IMP and 
their PBC medications with them to each study visit. On visit days, patients will take their morning dose s of IMP and their usual PBC medications with food (or up to 
30 minutes after eating a meal)  after the study procedures have been completed. In cases 
where the FibroScan® assessment  is carried out on a different day than the study visit, 
refer to Section 5.2.2 for fasting and IMP instructions. 
In g
eneral, the assessments at the site visits will be conducted in the following order: 
• Patient -reported outcomes  (see Section  5.2.3 for the order of patient -reported 
outcomes assessments)  
• AEs/concomitant medications recording 
• Physical examinations/vital signs/ECGs  
• Laboratory assessments/FibroScan® 
• Dispense IMP  
• Patient takes morning dose of IMP  with food (or up to 30 minutes after eating a 
meal) , as well as any morning doses of their usual medications for PBC  
(see Section  6.7) 
5.1 Demographics and Other Screening Assessments  
All patients will attend Screening Visit 1. If serum pregnancy (see Footnote  l of 
Table 1) retests are required, patients will attend Screening Visit  2. Screening Visit 2 is 
also performed at the discretion of the Investigator to retest liver stiffness, liver 
biochemistry and/or TSH when eligibility criteria are not met at Screening Visit 1 (see Footnotes h and i of Table 1). Screening Visit  1 and, if required, Screening Visit  2 
should be completed within 4 weeks prior to Randomization. If required, Screening Visit 2 should be conducted by Day -4. Screening Period extensions of up to 7 days 
may be considered on a case-by- case basis, if agreed by the Investigator and Medical 
Monitor. 
Demographics will be collected as described in Section  5.1.2. The assessment of 
medical history is described in Section  5.1.1. 
Safety assessments , including laboratory assessments, which  are also part of the 
screening assessments are described in Section 5.3. The eGFR will be calculated as 
described in Section  5.1.3. 
The screening assessment of liver stiffness by transient elastography (FibroScan
®) will 
be assessed as described in Section  5.2.2.

 Confidential   
    Prior medications will be assessed at Screening, as described in Section  6.6. 
5.1.1 Medical History  
Relevant m edical history, including any ongoing illnesses, will be recorded in the 
eCRF, with the start date and stop date (if applicable) of the illness/condition.  
Any prestudy procedures will be recorded in the eCRF as part of the medical history 
assessment.  
5.1.2 Demographics 
Demographic data, including year of birth/age, sex, and race, will be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
5.1.3 Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate  
The CKD- EPI formula for adults will be used to calculate eGFR (mL/min/1.73  m2) 
from the biochemistry and demographic data collected at Screening Visit 1. The eGFR 
will be calculated by the central laboratory  according to the  equation included in the 
central laboratory manual.  
5.1.4 Child -Pugh Score  
The Child-Pugh Score will be calculated from the total bilirubin, serum albumin, and INR central laboratory test results from blood samples collected at Screening Visit 1, together with the clinical criteria of hepatic encephalopathy and ascites. In case retesting o f liver function tests, TSH, and INR are performed at Screening Visit 2, 
then the Screening Visit 2 results are used for calculating the Child-Pugh Score. The formulas to calculate the Child -Pugh Score are provided in Appendix V .
 
5.2 Efficacy Assessments  
5.2.1 Biochemical Response 
Liver biochemistry blood samples for the assessment of biochemical response (based 
on ALP and total bilirubin levels) will be collected as described in Section  5.3.2. 
Biochemical  response will be assessed at each post -Baseline visit for which a liver 
biochemistry blood sample is collected. 
5.2.2 Liver Stiffness , Transient Elastography (FibroScan®) 
Transient elastography ( FibroScan®) will be used to assess the degree of liver stiffness. 
The assessment s will be conducted by a health professional trained, qualified, and 
experienced in the use of FibroScan® and in accordance with the manufacturer’s manual 
and the study specific site operations manual. FibroScan
® will be carried out in the morning in fasting state, and hence predose , with 
fasting from 10 pm on the day prior to the study visit.  For assessments carried out on a 
different day  than the study visit , FibroScan® assessments can be performed on any day 
Sponsor Name: Calliditas Therapeutics  Suisse SA

 Confidential   
    during the specified visit windows pre dose or postdose but always after a 3-hour 
fasting . 
During the Screening Period , the FibroScan® assessment can be performed on any day 
between 28 and  4 days prior to the Randomization/Baseline actual visit, after a 3-hour 
fasting . One repeat liver stiffness measurement can be performed within the Screening 
Period at the discretion of the Investigator for patients who do not meet the inclusion 
criterion at the initial screening assessment. If the inclusion criterion is then met, the patient may be eligible for the study. The FibroScan Screening assessment meeting the 
inclusion criterion will serve as the Baseline value.  
It is recommended that the patient’s FibroScan
® assessment is done by the same person 
using the same type of probe at each study visit. The results from FibroScan® 
assessments will be expressed in kPa.  FibroScan® images will be read locally. 
Investigators will printout the results of the FibroScan® assessments and file the 
printouts in the patient notes. The results, the FibroScan® software version and probe 
used will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Both non- SmartExam and SmartExam software  ve rsions can be used . Every effort 
should be made to not mix the use of non- SmartExam and SmartExam versions for the 
assessments in individual patients. FibroScan® acquisition files from SmartExam 
assessments should be downloaded from the FibroScan® and stored in accordance with 
the Study Operational Manual. Those files will be used to a posteriori compute the  liver 
stiffness values obtained without SmartExam algorithm. 
Patients  eligible for the study a re required to have liver stiffness of ≥8.0 kPa and an 
IQR/med of ≤30% at Screening. At each subsequent FibroScan® assessment an 
IQR/med of ≤30% for liver stiffness measurement is required ( Boursier et al 2013; 
Corpechot et al 2022).  
5.2.3 Patient-r eported Outcomes  
Patient -reported outcome questionnaires  will be completed on paper  at time points 
specified in Table 1. The  Sponsor or designee will provide the questionnaires to the 
study sites. Site staff should refer to the site operation manual for guidance on the 
administration of the patient -reported outcomes. The completed questionnaires will be 
maintained at the study site as source documents. The  results will be transcribed into 
the eCRF by site personnel. The eCRF entry guidelines include questionnaire- specific 
instructions on how to manage any ambiguous responses to individual items. 
• Fatigue will be assessed using the PROMIS short form-Fatigue 7b Daily 
(Section  5.2.3.1), and the PGIS fatigue, PGIC fatigue ( Section  5.2.3.5) and the 
PBC-40 fatigue domain ( Section  5.2.3.1). 
• Pruritus will be assessed using the WI- NRS ( Section  5.2.3.3), the PBC-40 itch 
domain ( Section  5.2.3.1), and the PGIS and PGIC pruritus ( Section  5.2.3.5).  
• Social isolation symptoms will be assessed using the PBC-40 social domain (Section  5.2.3.1).

    • Health -related  quality of life will be assessed using PROMIS -29 ( Section  5.2.3.4) 
• Health utility data will be computed using the EQ -5D Utility Index 
(Section  5.2.3.6).  
The patient -reported outcome questionnaires PBC -40, PROMIS -29, and EQ -5D are 
completed at the site. The completion of questionnaires at the site visits should be 
performed before any of the other study procedures, including the collection of blood for labo ratory assessments. At study site visits, the patient will be asked to read and 
complete the questionnaires independently. The patient will be given sufficient time to complete the assessments. If a patient is unable to read, the site staff will administer  the 
questionnaires by reading aloud the content of the questionnaires to the patient and recording the patient’s verbal response. The questionnaires will be administered in the following order: 
• PBC-40 
• PROMIS -29 
• EQ-5D 
The p atient questionnaires PROMIS s hort f orm-Fatigue 7b Daily and WI -NRS are 
completed at home every evening for 7 days prior to the site visits. PGIS and PGIC for fatigue and pruritus, respectively, are completed at home in the evening prior to the site visits  (ie, Day 7 of each of the diary completion weeks) . The questionnaires are 
provided as booklets  where the questionnaires are placed in the order specified below . 
Detailed completion instructions are included in the booklets. 
• PROMIS  short form -Fatigue 7b Daily 
• WI-NRS  
• PGIS fatigue 
• PGIC fatigue  
• PGIS pruritus 
• PGIC pruritus 
5.2.3.1 Primary Biliary Cholangitis -40 Questionnaire 
The PBC -40 is a disease- specific health -related quality of life measure validated for use 
in patients with PBC ( Jacoby et  al 2005). The questionnaire comprises 40 questions in 
6 domains related to fatigue, emotional, social, and cognitive function, general symptoms, and itch, and 3 additional questions related to general health and well -being. 
Patients will be asked to select his/he r most appropriate response for all questions 
applying a 1- week recall period.

    5.2.3.2 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Short 
Form -Fatigue 7b Daily  
The PROMIS  short form -Fatigue 7b  Daily  is a generic fatigue scale designed to 
measure daily fatigue. The instrument comprises 7 items and is completed daily using a recall period of ‘since waking up’. This measure will be completed at home by the patient via daily diary over 7 consecutive days prior to the study visits. 
5.2.3.3 Worst Itch Numerical Rating Scale 
The 11-point WI-NRS will be completed at home and collected  via daily diary over 
7 days prior to the visits.  
5.2.3.4 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
Questionnaire 
The PROMIS -29 Profile (v2.1) comprises 7  domains (anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain 
interference, physical function, sleep disturbance, and ability to participate in social roles and activities) and a single pain intensity item ( Cella  et al 2010) . Each of the 
7 domains contains 4 items.  Patients will be asked to respond to each question or 
statement by marking the box underneath the most appropriate response. 
5.2.3.5 Patient’s Global Impression of Severity and Patient’s Global 
Impression of Change Fatigue and Pruritus 
PGIS  and PGIC  fatigue and PGIS  and PGIC  pruritus  will be recorded at the times 
indicated in Table 1. 
5.2.3.6 EuroQoL 5- Dimension Utility Index  
The 5 -level version of the EQ -5D (EQ -5D- 5L) comprises a descriptive system with 
5 dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety/depression) and the EQ -VAS  (Herdman et al  2011; EuroQoL Research 
foundation 2019).  
Each of the 5  dimensions in the descriptive system has 5 levels: no problems, 
slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The 
patient will be asked to indicate his/her health by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the 5  dimensions. This decision results in a 1- digit 
number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the 5 dimensions will be combined into a 5 -digit number that describes the patient’s health 
state.  
The EQ -VAS  is a vertical VAS  numbered from 0 to 100, where 0= The worst health 
you can imagine, and 100=The best health you can imagine. The patient will be asked to mark an X on the scale to indicate how his/her health is today, and to write the number he/she marked on the scale in the box next to the scale.

Drug screen (urine): a urine screen for amphetamines, cocaine or opiates (ie, heroin 
and morphine) will be performed at Screening. Patients on stable methadone or 
buprenorphine maintenance treatment for at least 6 months prior to Screening Visit  1 
may be included in the study. Patients with a positive urine drug screen due to prescription opioid- based medication are eligible if the prescription and diagnosis are 
reviewed and approved by the Investigator. Patients with a positive urine drug screen, if not due to prescriptional use of a concomitant medication, as confirmed by the Investigator, will be excluded from the study. Medicinal cannabis and cannabidiol products are not allowed. 
Urinalysis:  quantitative test for urine pH and protein; qualitative tests for glucose, 
ketones, bilirubin, blood, and microscopic examination of the sediment Pregnancy test (urine): See Section  5.3.3. 
Refer to the central laboratory manual for details regarding the collection, processing, 
and shipping of the blood and urine samples. 
The Investigator must review the laboratory report  and assess results for clinical 
significance, including ALP values, document this review, and record any clinically 
relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF.  Refer to 
Section 7.1.4. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those that  are not associated with 
the underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than 
expected for the patien t’s condition.

    All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during the 
patien t’s participation in the study or within 30  days after the last dose of I MP, 
whichever is later,  should be repeated until the values return to normal, to  Baseline  
levels , or have stabilized and are no longer clinically significant , as determined  by the 
Investigator or M edical Monitor. 
If such values do not return to normal/ Baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by the Investigator, then the etiology should be identified,  and the Sponsor 
(or designee) notified. 
If required due to COVID -19-related restrictions , laboratory samples to follow -up 
an AE, including the retests for DILI (see Appendix II), absolute reticulocyte count 
(see Section 5.3.2.2 ), or TSH and free T4 (see Section  5.3.2.3), may be collected by a 
qualified healthcare professional at a location other than the study site. For other 
circumstances pertaining to patient safety during COVID -19-related restrictions, 
follow-up with the Sponsor (or designee). Laboratory samples taken to follow -up an AE , including, absolute reticulocyte 
count , or TSH and free T4 noted above, may be tested locally so that the results are 
communicated to the Investigator’s site promptly. If required due to COVID -19-related 
restrictions, the results of local safety laboratory tests may be provided to the 
Investigator by phone. Local  laboratory results will not be entered  into the eCRF . 
However, where  unscheduled central laboratory confirmation is not possible for 
protocol- specified retests for evaluation of anemia, or hypothyroidism , the retest results 
may be requested . 
For cases of suspected DILI ( Appendix II), the retesting as well as close monitoring 
will be done by central laboratory  only. 
5.3.2.1 Suspected  Drug -induced Liver Injury 
During the study, the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry. The Investigator is responsible for determining whether the patient  meets 
DILI criteria at any point during the study. 
In the event that a patient has  any of the following laboratory results , please refer to 
Appendix II for details regarding the detection and management of suspected or 
confirmed  cases  of DILI, including instructions for retesting, close monitoring, and 
action to take regarding the IMP: 
• AST or ALT ≥3×ULN  
• AST or ALT >2×Baseline 
• Total bilirubin >2×ULN 
• INR >1.5 (except for patients on anticoagulant therapy). 
Baseline values for liver tests (ALT  and AST) are determined by averaging the values 
obtained at Screening and Baseline/Day  1 to determine the arithmetic mean .

    Details of the IMP stopping criteria relating to su spected or confirmed DILI are 
provided in Section 4.4 and Appendix II. 
Any suspected or confirmed DILI events  meeting the criteria for an AESI,  as defined 
in Section  7.1.5, will be reported to the Sponsor (or designee) following the same 
procedure as for  SAE s (see Section  7.4). 
5.3.2.2 Detection and Management of Potential Bone Marrow Toxicity 
Particular attention will be given to the detection and management of potential cases of 
bone marrow toxicity. In case of Grade ≥2 severity anemia, the Investigator will instruct 
the patient to interrupt IMP administration and to return to the study center within 7 days so that the absolute reticulocyte count can be retested. If the retest value is below 50% of the Baseline value, IMP will not be resumed  and will be permanently 
discontinued. IMP administration will be resumed, only if the retest value for t he 
absolute reticulocyte count is ≥50% of the Baseline value and a Grade ≤ 1 of anemia, 
and an alternative cause for the anemia can be documented. The patient will continue to be closely monitored (at least weekly) until normalization of the reticulocyte count, ie, return to Baseline values.  
Anemia will be reported to the Sponsor  (or designee)  as an AESI , as defined in  
Section  7.1.5, following the same procedure as for SAEs ( Section  7.4).  
5.3.2.3 Detection and Management of Hypothyroidism 
Particular attention will be given to the detection and management of potential cases of hypothyroidism. In c a s e  o f  T S H  ≥ 1 0  mIU/L, based on the regular TSH laboratory  
follow- up and/or based on unscheduled TSH test due to change of the thyroid hormone 
replacement dose for patients on thyroid hormone replacement therapy, or initiation of thyroid hormone replacement therapy, the Investigator will instruct the patient to interrupt IMP administration and to return to the study center within 5 days so that  TSH 
and free T4  values can be retested  at the central laboratory . If the retest value is 
≥10 mIU/L  with reduced free T4 , IMP will not be resumed. If hypothyroidism is not 
confirmed  (ie, central laboratory TSH <10  mIU/L and normal free T4), IMP  
administration will be resumed as per protocol. The patient  will continue to be closely 
monitored by at least their clinical status and TSH/free T4 levels  (at least weekly)  until 
normalization  of the TSH and free T4 values,  ie, return to B aseline values.  
Hypothyroidism will be reported to the Sponsor  (or designee)  as an AESI , as defined 
in Section  7.1.5, following the same procedure as for SAEs ( Section  7.4).  
5.3.3 Pregnancy 
All patien ts are required to meet the requirements relating to pregnancy and use of 
contraception described in the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Section  4.1 and 
Section  4.2, respectively).  
For female patients who are considered postmenopausal but have less than 12 months of amenorrhea and who are not on concomitant estrogen replacement therapy, a high

 Confidential   
    FSH level in the postmenopausal range will be required at Screening . Confirmation 
with more than one FSH measurement is required. 
Serum (beta human chorionic gonadotrophin) or urine pregnancy tests will be 
performed for female patien ts of childbearing potential at the time points indicated in  
Table 1. 
Female patients of childbearing potential must have a serum  pregnancy test at 
Screening  Visit 1. The blood sample for the serum pregnancy test must be taken within 
7 days of Day 1. Therefore, if Screening Visit  1 is performed more than 7 days prior to 
Day 1, the serum pregnancy test must be repeated at Screening Visit  2 within 7  days of 
Day 1. The result must be negative for the patien t to be eligible for the study . If the test 
result is positive, the patien t must be excluded from the study. The serum pregnancy 
tests will be analyzed  by the central laboratory. A negative  urine pregnancy test result 
is required at Randomization/Baseline before dosing. Urine pregnancy tests will be 
analyzed locally.  
Monitoring for pregnancies in female patients  and the partners of male patient s will 
continue from the patien t’s inclusion in the study until  30 days after the last dose of 
IMP. Male patient s will be required to inform the Investigator if their partner becomes 
pregnant during the study  and up to 30 days after the last dose of IMP. The Investigator 
should inform the Sponsor (or designee)  within 24  hours of learning of the pregnancy 
or partner pregnancy by completing and submitting a pregnancy report form (refer to 
the SAE contact information at the beginning of this protocol) to the Sponsor 
(or designee) . 
If a patient  becomes pregnant, she will permanently discontinue IMP and attend an EoT 
Visit 30 days after the last dose of IMP , after which the patient will be encouraged to 
continue study assessments until completion of the Week 24 Visit (Visit 8) . Any 
pregnant patient  and the fetus will be closely followed- up throughout the duration of 
the pregnancy to determine the outcome (including spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality). The  Investigator will ask the 
patien t to provide informed consent to record information on the health of the baby. 
Generally, follow -up will be required for no longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the 
estimated delivery date.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital abnormalities, ectopic pregnancy) will be considered SAEs.  
For any male study patient’s  partner who becomes pregnant, the Investigator will 
attempt to collect pregnancy information on the male patient ’s partner while the male 
patien t is in this study until 30 days after the last dose of IMP.  The Investigator will 
record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor (or designee)  within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The I nvestigator will 
obtain informed consent from the female partner to  collect information about the 
pregnancy and its  outcome. Information on the status of the mother and child will be

    forwarded to the Sponsor (or designee). Generally, the follow -up will be no longer than 
6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy 
will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. Abnormal  pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, 
fetal death, stillbirth, congenital abnormalities, ectopic pregnancy) will be considered SAEs.  
5.3.4 Breastfeeding  
Breastfeeding women will be excluded from the study. 
5.3.5 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as outlined in Table 1  with the patient in a sitting  position 
after 5  minutes ’ rest and will include pulse rate, systolic blood pressure ( SBP), and 
diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ). Body temperature will be measured at Screening 
Visit 1 according to local standard of care . Method of temperature measurement will 
be recorded in the patient notes and in the eCRF. 5.3.6 12-lead Electrocardiogram 
An ECG device with a built -in printer will be provided by Clario and will be used for 
all study ECG assessments. Triplicate  12-lead ECG s will be obtained as outlined in 
Table 1. The ECGs will be conducted in the supine position after 5 minutes’ rest. At each time 
point at which triplicate ECG are required, 3  individual ECG tracings should be 
obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2 minutes apart. The 
full set of triplicates should be completed in less than 4  minutes.  
The ECG tracing printout should be signed and dated by the person who made the 
interpretation  locally (for purposes of patient safety management) ; the tracing  printout 
will be archived at the study site. The machines will provide heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, 
QTc intervals , and abnormal findings. 
Electrocardiograms obtained throughout the study will be  electronically transferred for 
central  read ing. 
The central reader will analyze the patient’s ECG results. The ECG analysis from  the 
central reading , including HR (bpm), RR, QT, QRS, QTc Baze tt, and QTc Fridericia 
intervals (milliseconds), and interpretation (abnormalities, rhythm, conduction), will be 
sent to the study site. The mean QTc Fridericia interval calculated by the central reader and based on triplicate ECGs, will be used for the assessment of eligibility. 
If there is any evidence of the cardiac conditions or abnormalities as described  in 
Section  4.4.1, IMP is to be permanently discontinued. 
Further details regarding the ECG assessments are provided in the site operations 
manual or manual provided by the vendor.

    5.3.7 Physical Examination, Including Height and Body Weight  
Patien ts will undergo complete physical examinations and symptoms- directed physical 
examinations, as indicated in Table 1. 
The complete physical examination will include assessments of the standard physical 
examination items, including general appearance, skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, head and neck, heart, chest and lungs, abdomen, extremities, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal, neurological, and other body systems , if applicable , for describing the status of the 
patient’s health.  
Body weight and height (height at Screening Visit  1 only) will also be measured and 
recorded. The patien t should be dressed in light clothing, without shoes. 
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. Any new abnormalities or worsening of existing abnormalities  that are 
associated with signs and/or symptoms (except for PBC -related pre -existing conditions  
[see Section  7.3]) should be reported as AEs  or SAEs , as appropriate  (see 
Section  7.1.4).  
5.4 Adverse Clinical Outcomes  
The following adverse clinical outcomes will be captured during the study: 
• All-cause mortality  
• Patients requiring a liver transplant (transplant list inclusion)  
• MELD score of ≥15 (confirmed at repeat testing at least 14 days apart), as calculated 
by the central laboratory, according to the formulas in Appendix III  
The MELD score will be calculated based on the results from the liver biochemistry 
(total bilirubin), biochemistry (creatinine , and sodium if MELD score  >11), and 
hematology (INR) blood samples, collected as described in Section  5.3.2. 
• Variceal bleed  
• Portal hypertension bleed 
• Hepatic encephalopathy (West  Haven criteria), see Appendix IV  
• Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 
• Uncontrolled ascites requiring treatment  
In the event of any of these outcomes, IMP will be permanently discontinued, as noted in Section  4.4.1, and the patient may continue study visits. 
Investigators will record the AEs in the  Adverse Event page of the eCRF  and will 
indicate on the Adverse Event page if it meets the criteria for an SAE . If the event meets

    the criteria of an SAE,  it will be reported using the paper safety report form  within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the event. 
The adverse clinical outcomes will be adjudicated by the Adjudication Committee  (see 
Section  9.4.1).  
Investigators will indicate on the eCRF Adverse Event page if the event meet s the 
criteria for  adjudication. If the event meets the criteria for adjudication, the Investigator 
will then complete the Adjudication Event eCRF.  
Please refer to the Investigator adjudication manual for further information. 5.5 Pharmacokinetics  
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of setanaxib 
and GKT138184 at the visits  specified in  Table 1. The PK blood volumes to be 
collected during the study will be provided in the ICF and/or in the central laboratory 
manual. Samples will be collected predose in the morning. Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by 
the Sponsor (or designee) and will be included in the central laboratory manual. The 
actual date and time that  each sample is collected will be recorded.  
The measurement of plasma setanaxib and GKT138184 concentrations will be performed by a central laboratory. 
5.6 Future Biomarker Research  
Patients will have the option to accept or decline additional blood sampling for future 
biomarker research.  
Patients who consent to future biomarker research will have a blood sample collected at Baseline and Week 24.  The optional biomarker blood volumes to be collected during 
the study will be provided in the ICF and/or in the central laboratory manual. 
The blood samples will be used for analyses of biomarkers related to liver fibrosis 
and/or PBC. The biomarker analyses results may be used to explore potential relationship with setanaxib response and/or disease progression data obtained in this study. 
The results of the biomarker analyses will be reported separately from the clinical study 
report (CSR) and individual biomarker analysis results will not be reported to the 
Investigator or the Site.  
Details on processes for collection, shipment and destruction of the samples can be found in the central laboratory manual.

    5.7 Future Genetic Research  
Where local regulations and Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC)allow, a blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected at Baseline 
from patients  who have consented to participate in the genetic analysis component of 
the study. The blood volume of this optional sample will be provided in the ICF and/or 
in the central laboratory manual. Participation is optional. Patient s who do not wish to 
participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study.  
DNA samples will be used for research related to setanaxib  and/or PBC and related 
diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assays , including diagnostic tests 
related to setanaxib  and/or IMPs of this drug class and PBC. The genetic research may 
consist of the analysis of one or more candidate gene (s) or the analysis of genetic 
markers throughout the genome or analysis of the entire genome. 
The samples may be analyzed  as part of a multi- study assessment of genetic factors 
involved in the response to setanaxib  or IMPs of this class to understand study disease 
or related conditions. The results of genetic analyses will be reported separately from the CSR and will not 
be communicated to study sites. The Sponsor or designee will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with 
adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  
Details on processes for collection , shipment, and destruction of these samples can be 
found in the central laboratory manual.

    Setanaxib and placebo will be provided in high-density  polyethylene (HDPE) bottles  
containing: 
• Setanaxib 400 mg film-coated tablets for morning dosing 
• Matching placebo film-coated tablets for morning dosing 
• Setanaxib 400 mg film-coated tablets for evening dosing 
• Matching placebo film-coated tablets for evening dosing. 
Each bottle will contain 70  film- coated tablets.  
The packaging of the placebo will be the same as the IMP in order to maintain the blind.  
Setanaxib and placebo will be shipped and stored under controlled conditions according 
to the storage requirements.  The IMP must be stored at room temperature or below (the 
film- coated tablets must not be frozen or stored above 25ºC or 77ºF).  
Refer to the pharmacy manual for full details for packaging, label ling, and shipment of 
the IMP. 
Almac UK will label and package the IMP  bottles and will supply the IMP to local 
depots/study sites on behalf of the Sponsor (or designee) . 
6.2 Blinding  
This study is double -blinded. The Investigator, the site personnel, the Sponsor and their 
representatives involved in monitoring and conducting the study, the Adjudication 
Committee, and the patients will be blinded to treatment assignments.  
Randomization data will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized staff 
and the IDMC  until the time of unblinding. Authorized staff may include the 
randomization statistician, who will store the master randomization list in a secure system, an unblinded statistician , and unblinded programmers , who will provide the 
IDMC  with unblinded data for review  in accordance with the procedures described in 
the IDMC  Charter. The randomization will be performed by the external interactive 
voice response system/interactive web response system  (IXRS) provider , Almac . The 
blinded statistician supporting the study will have no access to the unblinded 
randomization schedule. All authorized unblinded staff must be documented. 
The setanaxib and placebo film- coated tablets are visually identical in order to maintain 
the blind. Setanaxib  and placebo  bottles  will be coded and labe led in a manner that 
protects blinding. The coding system will permit rapid identification of the product (in 
case of medical emergencies ), that does not permit undetectable breaking of the blind. 
Breaking of the blind is only allowed in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the I MP is essential for the clinical management of the patien t. In such emergency 
situations, the responsibility to break the treatment code resides solely with the Investigator. The Investigator will have immediate access to break the blind through

    IXRS. The Investigator  must contact the Sponsor within 1  working day after the event, 
without revealing to the S ponsor ( or contract research organization [ CRO ]) the results 
of the code break, except to the designated global patient safety representative. The 
Investigator must document the date of unblinding and the reason. 
Emergency unblinding will be organized through IXRS. The Investigator must record 
the date of unblinding and the reason. All breaks of the blind must be adequately 
documented. 
If an SAE is reported, the designated global patient safety representative may unblind 
the treatment assignment for the individual patien t through IXRS in order to meet 
regulatory reporting requirements. 
Although Investigators are blinded to treatment assignments, the Investigators will 
review the laboratory reports, which will include ALP and bilirubin values. This is required to ensure the appropriate medical management of the patient from a safety perspective.  
6.3 Method of Assigning Treatment  
Each patient  will have a unique s creening  number obtained from the IXRS. This will 
be assigned at S creening Visit 1. If a patient is rescreened (see Section  4.3), the 
rescreened patient should be assigned a new unique s creening number. The Investigator 
will keep a record (the patient screening log) of patients  who enter S creening.  
Once the patien t has been successfully screened and the Investigator has determined 
that the patien t is eligible, the patient  will be confirmed as enrolled within the IXRS. 
Randomization will be performed via a centralized IXRS. 
The randomization codes will be prepared by the randomization statistician. 
The randomization statistician will store the master randomization list in a secure 
system.  
If a patient withdraws from study participation, his/her unique identification number(s) cannot be re-used for another patient. 
On Day  1, eligible patients will be assigned to setanaxib 1200 mg/day, setanaxib 
1600 mg/day, or placebo according to a 1:1:1 randomization ratio, stratified by 
Screening  serum ALP  < or ≥3.0×ULN . Each patient will receive a unique 
randomization number when he/she is assigned IMP. Patients will be allocated to IMP according to the randomization code. 
6.4 Dose and Administration 
Patients will be assigned to IMP as described in Section  6.3. 
At each dispensing visit  (Table 1) , patients will receive kit(s) comprising 4  bottle s (see 
Table 2) . Each bottle contains 70 film- coated table ts. Patients will be dispensed 1 or

Patients will take 4  tablets per day, 1 tablet from each bottle. Two tablets will be taken 
in the morning and 2 tablets will be taken in the evening (see Table 2), for 24 weeks. 
• Patients allocated to setanaxib 1200 mg/day will self -administer 2  tablets of 
setanaxib 400 mg in the morning, 1 tablet of setanaxib 400 mg in the evening, and 
1 tablet of placebo in the evening. 
• Patients allocated to setanaxib 1600 mg/day will self -administer 2  tablets of 
setanaxib 400 mg in the morning and 2 tablets of setanaxib 400 mg in the evening. 
• Patients allocated to placebo will self -administer 2  placebo tablets in the morning 
and 2 placebo tablets in the evening. 
Patients will be instructed not to take their morning IMP dose on visit days until after the study assessments have been completed. 
The tablets should be taken orally with food or up to 30 minutes after eating a meal. 
Each tablet should be taken separately and swallowed whole with water.  The patients 
will be instructed to distribute their morning and evening doses as even as possible. For BID administration, the dosage interval should be at least 4 hours. A missed 
morning dose can therefore be taken up until 4 hours prior to the evening dose.  Patients  
will be provided with a patient IMP dosing card.  Patients will be instructed to record 
the date and time of each tablet that they take on the dosing card straight after they have taken the tablet.  
Patients will be reminded  to bring the IMP (including any empty bottles and packaging) 
and the patient IMP dosing card with them to each study visit. 
The IMP dosing card will be considered as a source document. Site personnel will 
record the date and time of the IMP dose prior to PK Visits in the eCRF . 
6.4.1 Dose Modification 
No dose modifications are permitted on a patient -basis in this study. Dose interruptions 
are required in case of DILI, anemia, and hypothyroidism, when the events meet the

    criteria as defined in Appendix II, Section  5.3.2.2, and Section  5.3.2.3, respectively.  
Events that require permanent discontinuation of IMP are listed in Section  4.4.1. 
6.4.2 Intervention A fter the End of the Study  
Continued access to IMP is not planned beyond the completion of the study. 
6.5 Precautions and/or Lifestyle Considerations  
Patients  will be asked to fast from 10 pm on the day prior to study visits until after the 
study procedures have been completed. In cases where the FibroScan® assessment s are 
carried out on a different day than the  study visit, refer to Section 5.2.2  for fasting 
instructions. 6.6 Prior Medication  
The requirements regarding  prior use of UDCA and second -line therapies for PBC, 
including OCA, fenofibrate, or bezafibrate, are provided in the inclusion c riteria 
(Section  4.1).  The recording requirements for prior medications are included in 
Section  6.7. 
Prohibited Medications 
The following medications are prohibited within 3 months of Screening Visit 1, and 
during the study: oral and systemic corticosteroids, colchicine, mycophenolate mofetil, 
azathioprine, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, valproate, or isoniazid . Note: nonsystemic corticosteroids, ie, topical/nasal/inhaled/other 
corticosteroids are allowed provided used in recommended doses, and up to 7 days of low doses up to up to 10 mg prednisone or equivalent of oral/parenteral corticosteroids are allowed.  
Treatment with any investigational agent within 12 weeks of Screening Visit 1 or 
5 half -lives of the IMP (if known) (whichever is longer) is prohibited, as is current 
enrollment in another interventional clinical study. 
6.7 Concomitant Medication and Procedures  
The use of a UDCA at a prescriptional dose is required during the study, unless the 
patient is  intolerant to UDCA (see Inclusion Criterion  6). Second- line therapies for 
PBC, including OCA, fenofibrate, or bezafibrate, are also permitted during the study. For patients receiving these agents, all efforts should be made to maintain the dose of UDCA, OCA, and fenofibrate or bezafibrate stable during the Double-blind Treatment Period. The reasons for considering a dose change should be clearly documented in the study documentation. Patients should not start additional treatments for PBC after 
Randomization. If PBC treatments are started it will lead to IMP discontinuation.  Dose 
modifications of concomitant PBC treatments initiated before Randomization do not require IMP discontinuation.

    Patients will be instructed not to take their usual PBC medications on visit days until 
after the study assessments have been completed. Patients will be reminded to bring 
their medications for PBC with them to each  study visit. 
Regarding COVID -19 vaccin ation , as setanaxib does not have immunosuppressive 
properties based on nonclinical and clinical safety data, the Sponsor considers that study patients may undergo COVID -19 vaccination during the study. 
Concomitant Medications to be Used with Caution 
Setanaxib has been shown to be a weak inhibitor of OAT3, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 in a clinical study. In addition, setanaxib inhibited BCRP and P -glycoprotein in vitro . This 
may result in increased exposures of applicable concomitant medications, and hence caution should be exercised with use of: 
• Medications that are primarily eliminated through OAT3  
• Sensitive CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic range 
such as warfarin and phenytoin (CYP2C9) and S-mephenytoin (CYP2C19) 
• Sensitive substrates of BCRP and P-glycoprotein such as digoxin 
In vitro  data suggests that setanaxib is an inducer of CYP2B6. This may result in 
decreased exposures and therefore reduced efficacy of applicable concomitant medications, and hence caution should be exercised with use of: 
• Sensitive CYP2B6 substrates, such as tamoxifen, valproic acid, and 
cyclophosphamide 
Prohibited Concomitant Medi
 cations  
The prohibited ( prior) medications and devices  listed in Section  6.6 are also prohibited 
during the Double-blind Treatment Period.  
In addition, the following medications are prohibited during the Double-blind 
Treatment Period:  
• Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (itraconazole, lopinavir/itonavir, telaprevir, clarithromycin, ritonavir, ketoconazole, indinavir/ritonavir, conivaptan, and voriconazole) 
• Potent UGT 1A9 inhibitors and inducers: such as belumosudil, cannabidiol, 
cannabinol, deferasirox, diflunisal, eltrombopag, fosphenytoin/phenytoin, isavuconazole, medical cannabis, mefenamic acid, methylene blue, morniflumate, niflumic acid, perampanel, regorafenib, rifampicin, sorafenib, umifenovir) 
If patients receive a prohibited medication, Investigators should consider if IMP administration should be temporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued. Additionally, if a patient has taken a prohibited medication (eg, short -term antifungal 
therapy) and the Investigator learns about it later, this might not lead to the permanent

    discontinuation of IMP. In this case, there should be no signs of drug- drug interaction 
and continuation of IMP administration will be left to the Investigator ’s discretion . 
Medication Recording Requirements  
Prior and concomitant medications taken for PBC, including UDCA, OCA, fenofibrate 
or bezafibrate, will be recorded up to the end of the EoT Visit in the appropriate section 
of the eCRF.  
All other medication (including vaccines, over -the- counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) taken from 3 months (90 days) before Screening  
Visit 1 until the end of the EoT Visit will also be recorded in the appropriate section of 
the e CRF.  
The following details must be recorded in the e CRF:  
• Medication name, ideally the generic name  
• Reason for use 
• Start and end date of administration  
• The dose and frequency of administration 
In addition, the following details of medications taken for PBC, will be recorded in the 
eCRF:  
• Prior use of OCA (yes/no), fenofibrate (yes/no), bezafibrate (yes/no) 
• Reason for dose change (only concomitant medications taken for PBC) 
• Reason for discontinuing prior or concomitant medications taken for PBC 
The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding prior or 
concomitant medication or procedures. 
6.8 Overdose  
For this study, a single intake of 5 or more setanaxib tablets and/or a total daily dose of 
7 or more tablets  will be considered an overdose. 
The Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose with setanaxib . 
Decisions regarding dose interruptions will be made by the Investigator based on the 
clinical evaluation of the patien t. 
In the event of an overdose, patient s should be closely observed /hospitalized for close 
observation and appropriate symptomatic/supportive medical care and be followed 
until resolution/stabilization of any clinical issues.

 Confidential   
    Any instance of overdose (suspected or confirmed and irrespective of whether or not it 
involved setanaxib ) must be communicated to the Sponsor ( or a specified designee ) 
using the overdose report form  within  24 hours of becoming aware of its occurrence.  
Any overdose associated with clinical symptoms will be recorded as an AE or SAE, as appropriate. Note that an overdose without clinical symptoms will not be recorded as 
an AE or SAE, even if the patient was hospitalized for observation. Details of any signs or symptoms and their management should be recorded, including details of any 
treatments administered for the overdose. All overdoses with clinical symptoms meeting the SAE criteria must be reported as described in Section 7.4. 
6.9 Compliance  
The Investigator ( or designee ) will explain the correct use of the I MP to each patien t 
and will check that each patien t is following the instructions properly. Patients will 
document the IMP doses that they take on a patient IMP dosing card. Compliance will be assessed at each visit by  counting the returned tablets  and will be 
documented in the source documents and eCRF. Any deviation from the correct use of 
the IMP will be recorded in the e CRF.  
A record of the number of I MP tablets  dispensed to and taken by each patien t will be 
maintained and reconciled with I MP and compliance records. The I MP start and stop 
dates, including dates for IM P interruptions, will also be recorded in the e CRF.  
6.10 Accountability  
The I MP must not be used for any purpose other than that defined in this protocol. 
All supplies of I MP will be accounted for in accordance with Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP ). 
The pharmacist ( or designee) should maintain accurate records of all I MP supplies 
received during the study. These records should include the dates and amounts of IM P 
that were received at the site, dispensed, and destroyed or returned to the Sponsor (or designee) . The  records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, 
expiration dates (if  applicable), and the unique code numbers assigned to the I MP and 
study patient s. If errors or damage in the I MP shipments occur, the Investigator should 
contact the Sponsor ( or its designee ) immediately. Copies of the I MP accountability 
records will be provided by each Investigator for inclusion in the trial master file. The 
study monitor will periodically check the supplies of I MP held by the Investigator or 
pharmacist to verify accountability of the IMP used. 
The Investigator (or designee) will dispense the IMP only to the identified patien ts in 
this study, according to the procedures described in this study protocol. Details of I MP 
dispens ed to patien ts, will be recorded in the eCRF. Investigators should maintain 
records that document adequately that the patien ts were provided the doses specified 
by the protocol and reconcile all IM P received from the Sponsor (or designee). 
After the end of the study, all unused I MP and all medication containers should be 
destroyed at the study center or returned to the drug depot  for destruction, as instructed

    7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patien t or clinical study patient  
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally asso ciated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Results in death (Investigators should identify 1 SAE that is the leading cause of 
death).  
• Is life -threatening. 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization. The event will be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, the event may jeopardize the patient 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above. Examples of such events include intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient  hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse. 
Definition of Terms  
Life-threatening: an AE is life -threatening if the patien t was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred,  i.e,, it does not include a reaction that, if it had occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death. For example, drug- induced hepatitis 
that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life -
threatening even though drug- induced hepatitis can be fatal. It does not include an AE 
or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Hospitalization: AEs requiring hospitalization should be considered SAEs. Hospitalization  for elective surgery, or for procedures planned prior to the patien t 
providing informed consent, or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an 
Sponsor Name: Calliditas Therapeutics  Suisse SA   
Protocol Number: GSN000350   
Version and Date: Version  5.0 (27 September 2023)  Page 89 of 126 
 
 
   
 Confidential   
    AE (eg, elective surgery for a pre- existing condition that has not worsened) need not be 
considered AEs or SAEs. If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that 
occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'nonserious' according to the 
usual criteria.  
In general, hospitalization signifies that the patien t has been detained (usually involving 
at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Disability/incapacity: an AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of the patient ’s ability to carry out normal life 
functions. 
7.1.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction is defined as an untoward and 
unintended response to a study drug, which is not listed in  the applicable product 
information  (eg, IB for an unapproved IMP or the SmPC [ Summary of Product 
Characteristics] for an authorized medicinal product) , and meets one of the following 
serious criteria: results in death, is life -threatening, requires hospitalization or 
prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity , is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or is an important medical event 
that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization; and is 
assessed as causally related to the I MP. For suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions, the blind will be broken for safety reporting purposes. 
7.1.4 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments  
Laboratory abnormalities without clinical significance should not be recorded as AEs 
or SAEs. However, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities  as per the 
Investigator’s assessment  (eg, clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis 
abnormalities) that require medical or surgical intervention or lead to I MP interruption 
or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE or SAE, as applicable. In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (eg, in ECGs, X- rays, or vital signs) that are 
associated wit h signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet 
the definition of an AE or SAE as described in Sections  7.1.1 and 7.1.2. Any worsening 
of existing abnormalities that are associated with signs and/or symptoms (except for PBCrelated - pre-existing conditions  [see Section  7.3]) should be reported as AEs  or 
SAEs, as appropriate . If the laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, record the 
syndrome or diagnosis (eg, anemia)  as the AE or SAE , not the laboratory result (ie, 
decreased hemoglobin). 
For specific information on handling of clinical laboratory abnormalities, see 
Section  5.3.2. 
7.1.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The AESIs for this study are DILI, anemia, and hypothyroidism. 
Sponsor Name: Calliditas Therapeutics  Suisse SA   
Protocol Number: GSN000350   
Version and Date: Version  5.0 (27 September 2023)  Page 90 of 126 
 
 
   
 Confidential   
    AESIs of DILI will be defined as any DILI event that meets the criteria in A , B, or C  
of Appendix II. Please refer to  Section  5.3.2.1 and Appendix II for details regarding the 
detection and management of cases of DILI.  
AESIs of anemia will be defined as CTCAE Grade  ≥2 anemia AND absolute 
reticulocyte counts of <50% of the Baseline value, which is confirmed by repeat testing. 
Please refer to Section  5.3.2.2 for details regarding the detection and management of 
potential cases of bone marrow toxicity. 
AESIs of hypothyroidism will be defined as TSH levels of ≥10 mIU/L, which is 
confirmed by repeat testing  at the central laboratory  (ie, TSH ≥10  mIU/L and reduced 
free T4). Please refer to Section  5.3.2.3 for details regarding the detection and 
management of hypothyroidism. The AESI should be reported by the i nvestigative site 
to the ICON  Drug Safety Center within 24 hours of learning about the event by 
completing the paper safety report f orm and sending it via email or fax. The 
documentation and processing of AESIs is further detailed in the Investigator S ite File. 
The AESIs will be adjudicated by the Adjudication Committee (see Section  9.4.1).  
Investigators will indicate on the relevant Adverse Event eCRF page if the event meet s 
the criteria for an AESI . If the event meets the criteria for a n AESI , the Investigator will 
inform the Sponsor (or designee) of the AESI utilizing the safety report form (refer to the SAE contact information at the beginning of this protocol) and will then complete the Adjudication Event eCRF. 
Please refer to the Investigator adjudication manual for further information. 7.2 Assessment of Adverse Events  
7.2.1 Severity  
The terms serious and severe are not synonymous. The general term “severe” is often 
used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is 
NOT the same as serious, which is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient ’s life or ability to function (see Section 7.1.2). A severe AE (classified as 
Grade 3) does not necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a WBC count of 1000/mm
3 to less than 2000/mm3 is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be 
considered serious. Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
Investigators will grade all AEs by severity using CTCAE  (version  4.03). 
If an AE is not listed in the CTCAE criteria, a corresponding grading is to be performed 
by the Investigator based on his/her best medical judgment as follows: 
• Mild (Grade 1): asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
Sponsor Name: Calliditas Therapeutics  Suisse SA   
Protocol Number: GSN000350   
Version and Date: Version  5.0 (27 September 2023)  Page 91 of 126 
 
 
   
 Confidential   
    • Moderate (Grade 2): minimal, local , or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limited  age- appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
• Severe (Grade 3): medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or limiting 
self-care ADL  
• Life-threatening (Grade 4): life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated  
• Death (Grade 5): death related to an AE  
7.2.2 Causality  
Investigators are required to systematically assess the causal relationship between the AEs and SAEs and the exposure to the IMP using the following definitions: 
Related:  
• The AE has a reasonable possibility of an association with the product because: ○ The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence to I MP administration and  
cannot be reasonably explained by the patient ’s clinical state or other risk 
factors (eg,  disease under study, concurrent diseases, or concomitant 
medications).  
○ The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence to I MP administration, and it 
is a known reaction to the drug under study or a related chemical group or  is 
predicted by known pharmacology or nonclinical safety . 
Not Related:  
• The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from IMP administration, or it can 
be reasonably explained by the patient’s clinical state or other factors (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications). 
7.3 Documenting and Reporting Adverse Events  
Reporting of AEs will begin when the patien t has provided informed consent and will 
continue up to 30 days after the last IMP administration . 
Occurrence of AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by the patien t; discovered as a 
result of general, nonleading verbal questioning by the study staff ; or determined by 
physical examination or other safety assessments. All AEs will be monitored and recorded in the e CRF throughout the entire study. Note that worsening of PBC -related 
pre-existing conditions will not be reported as AEs. Worsening of other existing 
abnormalities that are associated with signs and/or symptoms should be reported as AEs  
(or SAEs),  as appropriate. 
Sponsor Name: Calliditas Therapeutics  Suisse SA   
Protocol Number: GSN000350   
Version and Date: Version  5.0 (27 September 2023)  Page 92 of 126 
 
 
   
 Confidential   
    For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information (a 
description of the event, severity, time of occurrence , including whether the AE onset 
was before, during, or after the I MP administration if the AE started on a dosing day, 
duration, and any action, eg, treatment /follow- up tests). The outcome of the event 
should be provided along with the Investigator’s assessment of the relationship to the 
IMP. The Investigator must also assess whether the event meets the criteria for 
classification as an SAE.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all documentation (eg, hospital notes, 
laboratory reports, and diagnostic reports) related to an AE. Wherever possible, 
the Investigator’s diagnosis, not the individual signs and symptoms, will be 
documented as the AE. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the patient ’s 
conclusion of study participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, 
including death, at any time after a patien t has been discharged from the study, and 
he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the I MP or study participation, 
the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor (or designee). 7.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
For SAEs with an onset inside the reporting period (ie, onset after provision of informed 
consent and up to 30 days after the last IMP administration ), the Investigator must 
immediately , without undue delay but under no circumstances no later than 24 hours 
after becoming aware of the event , inform the Sponsor ( or designee ) of the SAE 
utilizing the safety report form (refer to the SAE contact information at the beginning of this protocol). 
The Investigator is obliged to respond to any request for follow -up information 
(eg, additional information, event outcome, final evaluation, or other records where 
needed) or to any question the Sponsor ( or designee ) may have concerning the SAE 
within the same timelines as those noted above for initial reports. This is necessary to 
ensure prompt assessment of the event by the Sponsor ( or designee ) and, as applicable, 
to allow the S ponsor to meet strict regulatory timelines associated with expedited 
reporting obligations for events of this nature. 
7.5 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Follow- up 
During the study (and after the patient’s participation in the study has ended), all AEs 
and SAEs should be followed proactively by the Investigator until the event resolves or 
the condition stabilizes to  a level acceptable to the Investigator, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or until the patien t is lost to follow -up. At the time the patien t’s 
study participation ends, all ongoing AEs and SAEs should be evaluated for resolution. New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed e CRF and the 
Investigator will submit any updated SAE/AESI information to the Sponsor  (or 
designee)  within the same timelines as those noted above for initial reports after  receipt 
of the information.

    7.6 Safety Reporting Oversight 
In accordance with ICH GCP, the Sponsor ( or designee ) will inform I nvestigators of 
“findings that could affect adversely the safety of patients, impact the conduct of the 
study, or alter the IEC/IRB’s approval/favorable opinion to continue the trial.” 
The Sponsor (or designee)  has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory 
authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of an I MP under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor (or designee) will comply with country- specific regulatory 
requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, 
and Investigators. To support compliance with these requirements, the Investigator 
must provide requested information in a timely manner. 
An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing SAEs or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor 
(or designee) will file it along with the IB  and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate , 
according to local requirements.

    8 STATISTICS  
8.1 General Procedures  
With the exception of the unblinded statistician and programmers supporting the 
IDMC, a ll personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until 
database lock and identification of protocol deviations. Analyses will be performed using SAS
® (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, US) by the Sponsor or its representatives. 
A detailed description of all statistical analyses to be performed for this study and any deviations from the analysis detailed in the protocol will be outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). A first version of the SAP will be prepared prior to the inclusion 
of the first study patient and the SAP will be approved prior to database lock . 
All data will be presented by treatment group. Descriptive statistics (number of observations, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for continuous variables, and counts and percentages will be presented for categorical 
variables.  
For the primary endpoint  of change in ALP  (%), Baseline is defined as the last 
nonmissing measurement prior to the first administration of study drug, or, if multiple 
pretreatment measurements are available, the arithmetic mean of the last (up to) 3 measurements preceding the first administration of study drug. This includes unscheduled and screening visits. For re screened  patient s, the value associated with 
their screen failure record will not be considered for B aseline. If a patient has a 
Screening Visit  2 due to a retest for ALP, the last nonmissing  measurement prior to the 
first administration of study drug will be used as B aseline for the efficacy analyses.  
For other endpoints, Baseline will be defined as the last nonmissing measurement before or on the date of first administration of IMP, unless otherwise stated in the SAP.  
The primary analysis will include data collected over a 24 -week Double-blind 
Treatment Period. Any data collected after W eek 24 (and a 4 -week Follow -up Period) 
will be listed and, where sufficient data are available, may be summarized.  
8.2 Analysis Populations 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all patients who are randomized to a treatment group and receive at least 1  tablet of IMP or placebo and have at least 1 post-B aseline 
value for the primary endpoint . This analysis set will be the primary set used for all 
efficacy analyses, along with the summary of disposition, demographics, and Baseline characteristics. Patients will be analyzed  according to the treatment group they were 
randomized to regardless of the actual treatment received.  
The Safety Analysis Set will include all randomized patients who receive at least 1 tablet of IMP or placebo. Patients will be analyzed  according to the treatment they 
actually received. This analysis set will be used for summaries of safety data.  
For supplementary analysis purposes, primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be repeated utilizing a Per  Protocol Set  (PPS) , including all patients who do not have any

 Confidential   
    major protocol deviations that would potentially affect the efficacy of the study drug. 
Major protocol deviations and any other reasons for exclusion from the PPS will be defined in the SAP and this analysis set will be finalized in a blinded manner prior to database lock.  The PPS will be analyzed as actually treated.  
The PK Analysis Set will include all patients who receive at least 1  dose of setanaxib 
and have at least 1  measured concentration at a scheduled PK time point postdose . 
Patients may be excluded if they have  an important AEs or protocol deviations that may 
impact PK.  
8.3 Sample Size 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in ALP (%) over 24 w eeks. 
It is planned to enroll approximately 60 to 70 patients. Patients will be randomized and 
allocated to placebo, setanaxib 1200 mg/day, or setanaxib 1600 mg/day according to a 1:1:1 randomization ratio. 
This study is designed to detect a >25% reduction in ALP in setanaxib -treated patients 
versus a 2.5% reduction in the placebo arm with an overall 2-sided p<0.05. Standard 
deviations are assumed to be 19% and 24% , respectively, based on the Phase 2a study 
with setanaxib and the Phase 3 POISE study with Ocaliva. With approximately 
16 evaluable patients per arm (48 patients overall)  and using a Hochberg step -up test to 
control alpha across 2 dose comparisons versus placebo , this study has  88.2%  global 
power to detect at least 1 treatment arm as significantly different from placebo  and 
68.3% power to detect both treatment arms as statistically significant. Also , for the 
secondary endpoint of change in fatigue, there will be >80% power to detect a 20% 
reduction in fatigue versus a 2.5% increase in the placebo arm. 
An assumed  dropout rate of approximately 25% leads to  a target sample size of 
66 enrolled patients (22 per arm). A range of approximately 60 to 70 enrolled patients 
allows for variability in the assumed dropout rate. 8.4 Statistical Methods  
8.4.1 Analysis of Efficacy  
Efficacy data will be presented and analyzed  using the FAS and a supplementary 
analysis  will be performed using the PPS. 
8.4.1.1 Primary Endpoint Analysis 
The primary endpoint is listed in Section  2.1. 
For the primary efficacy analysis, each setanaxib treatment group (1600 mg and 
1200 mg) will be compared with placebo. The primary estimand is to assess the change 
in ALP  (%) over 24 weeks in patients with PBC, elevated liver stiffness, and intolerance 
or inadequate response to UDCA.

    The following intercurrent events will be considered and further detailed in the SAP. 
Patients who start additional PBC -related medication (s) after Randomization will have 
their IMP discontinued ( Section 6.7). These patients will be included in the analysis, 
but efficacy data collected after the start of the new therapy will be excluded. PBC -
related medication(s) will be identified through blinded medical review prior to database lock. For all other patients who discontinue from treatment prior to Week 24 but return for the Week 24 Visit (Visit 8) , the Week  24 result will be used regardless of 
the occurrence of the intercurrent event.  Patients with missing result s will have their 
values imputed  based on observed data. Further details  will be defined in the SAP. 
The primary endpoint will be evaluated using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with log(ALP) – log(B aseline) as response with log( Baseline) as a 
continuous covariate, ALP stratification (<3.0 ×ULN or ≥ 3.0×ULN), treatment and visit 
as categorical covariates and treatment by visit as interaction term. All ALP data captured at W eeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 will be included in the model. The relative mean 
change from B aseline at Week 24 will be estimated and corresponding 2- sided 95% 
confidence intervals wi ll be calculated.  The relative mean change and confidence 
interval will also be converted to the percentage scale, for presentation purposes. 
An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within -patient correlation 
of data. The Kenward -Roger’s degrees -of-freedom adjustment will be used. Restricted  
maximum likelihood will be used to obtain parameter estimates. The least squares 
means will be estimated by visit along with the associated 95% confidence intervals and p- values  with the analysis taken from the estimate at 24 weeks.  In the case of 
insufficient patients at either level of the stratification, the stratification factor will be removed from the model.  
Model assumptions of the MMRM will be assessed using residual plots (such as q- q 
plots, histograms, box plots, and scatter plots). If the model above does not converge, heterogeneous Toeplitz covariance structure will be used instead of the unstructured covariance matrix. If convergence still does not meet, the Toeplitz structure then will 
be used. 
8.4.1.2 Multiplicity  
The null hypothesis is no difference in change in ALP  (%) between setanaxib and 
placebo over 24 weeks. The alternative hypothesis is that setanaxib demonstrates a 
difference in change in ALP ( %) over placebo. 
In order to control the study-wise error rate, that is, the probability of rejecting the true 
null hypothesis for the primary endpoint at 1- sided  0.025, a Hoch berg s tep-up 
procedure will be applied to adjust for 2 dose comparisons versus placebo. 
For the analysis of secondary and exploratory endpoints, “nominal” p -values will be 
presented  and will not be considered as part of the study- wise control  of type I error . 
This is considered appropriate for an exploratory Phase 2b study.

    8.4.1.3 Sensitivity Analysis  
Sensitivity analys es to test the intercurrent strategy and the a ssumption of missing at 
random for the MMRM model will be defined in the SAP. 
In the case of outliers in the ALP data, a further sensitivity analysis will utilize robust 
regression; this will be defined in the SAP. 8.4.1.4 Supplementary Analysis 
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be repeated using the  PPS, as defined 
in Section 8.2. 8.4.1.5 Secondary Endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoint s, as appropriate, will be analyzed using the same 
approach as the primary analysis. As additional secondary endpoints, t he 2 setanaxib dose arms will be combined for the 
analy sis of change in ALP (%), change in fatigue , and change in liver stiffness  and will 
be analyzed  per the primary endpoint. 
8.4.1.6 Exploratory Endpoints 
The exploratory endpoints are listed in Section  2.3. 
The analyses of the exploratory endpoints will be defined in the SAP. 8.4.2 Analysis of Safety 
The safety endpoints are listed in Section  2.2. 
The Safety Analysis Set  will be used for the analysis of safety data (AEs, including 
AESIs , clinical laboratory  tests , vital signs, 12- lead ECG s, and physical examination).  
AEs that occur, having been absent before the date and time of the first dose of the IMP, 
or have worsened in severity or seriousness after initiating the IMP until 30 days after the date and time of last dose of IMP will be classified as treatment- emergent AEs 
(TEAEs). The number of TEAEs and number and percentage of patients experiencing TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group, severity, and relation to IMP. TEAEs will be summarized by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class ( SOC ) and preferred term. All AEs will be listed by patient.  
SAEs will be listed by patients and summarized by treatment group, MedDRA SOC, and preferred term. Summaries will also be presented by severity and relationship to IMP.  
Laboratory data (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) will be converted to Système International units for reporting and processing purposes. Absolute values and changes from B aseline will be presented descriptively. Laboratory data outside 
study- specific reference ranges will be listed.

    Abnormal laboratory values will be listed by patient and summaries of the incidence 
and frequency by treatment group, scheduled visit, severity, and relationship to IMP will be presented. Shift tables of CTCAE (v ersion 4.03) graded labs will be presented. 
WBC and reticulocyte counts will be expressed in absolute values. Differential count will be expressed as both absolute count and percentage of WBCs. Evaluation of drug-
induced serious hepatotoxicity (eDISH) analysis will be conducted in order to explore 
potential liver toxicity signals by treatment group. 
Vital signs and ECG parameters will be presented descriptively.  Vital signs including 
pulse rate, SBP , and DBP and 12 -lead ECG data will be summarized by treatment group 
and listed by patient. A summary of abnormal physical examination findings by treatment group and 
scheduled visit will be presented. 
8.4.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic characteristics (including age, sex, ethnicity , and race) and B aseline 
characteristics (including height, weight , and disease characteristics) will be presented 
descriptively , overall and by treatment group. 
Discrepancies between r andomization stratification information (obtained from IXRS) 
and strata formed based on Screening  factors collected on eCRFs will be tabulated and 
listed.  
8.4.4 Pharmacokinetic  Analysis  
The PK Analysis Set will be used for PK Analyses. Plasma concentrations of setanaxib and GKT138184, along with blood sampling dates 
and actual blood sampling time relative to previous dosing time, will be listed by 
patient, dose group (ie, actual treatment ), and nominal sampling time. Samples with 
time deviation from nominal time will be identified and listed. Plasma concentrations of setanaxib and GKT138184 will be summarized with descriptive statistics by actual treatment  and nominal sampling time, and dose normalized, as appropriate. The 
descriptive statistics will include N, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation , 
geometric mean, median, Q1, Q3, minimum, and maximum. Mean plasma setanaxib and GKT138184 concentrations (dose normalized as appropriate) versus study visit will 
be plotted as a box plot. 
8.4.5 Handling of Missing Values  
If there are missing ALP or fatigue  data, imputation methods will be utilize d. These 
will be described in the SAP. Imputation for missing partial dates of AEs and concomitant medication will be 
specified in the SAP.

    10 RECORDS MANAGEMENT  
All clinical study information should be recorded, handled, and stored in a way that 
allows its accurate reporting, interpretation , and verification. This principle applies to 
all records referenced in this protocol, irrespective of the type of media used. 
An e CRF will be used to store and transmit patien t information. Information from the 
medical records (progress notes) and other source documents is to be promptly entered 
into the appropriate section of the eCRF. T he eCRF must be reviewed  and electronically 
signed and dated by the Investigator on an ongoing basis. The I nvestigator is 
responsible for verifying that the data entries are accurate and correct by signing the eCRF.  
Access to the e CRF will be strictly password protected and limited to personnel directly 
participating in the study. Data should be entered into the eCRF completely by 
authorized site personnel (eg, Investigators and the Study C oordinator). The e CRF must 
be completed as soon as possible after any patien t evaluation or communication. If data 
are to be changed due to erroneous input or other reason, an electronic audit trail will track these changes. The e CRFs and computers that store them must be accessible to 
study monitors and other regulatory auditors. 
During each study visit, a physician participating in the study will maintain progress 
notes in the patien t’s medical records to document all significant observations. At a 
minimum, these notes are to contain: 
• The date of the visit and the corresponding day or visit in the study schedule 
• General condition and status remarks by the patient, including any significant 
medical findings. The severity, frequency, duration, and resolution of any reported AE, and the Investigator's assessment as to whether the reported AE is related to IMP 
• Changes (including dosages) in concomitant medications/therapies (including medical foods) or procedures 
• A general reference to the procedures completed  
• Protocol deviations identified that could potentially affect safety and/or study results  
• The signature or initials of all physicians making an entry in the medical record (progress notes) 
In addition, any contact with the patien t via phone or other means that provides 
significant clinical information is to also be documented in the medical record (progress  notes), as described above. 
Changes to information in the medical record (progress notes) and other source documents are to be initialed and dated on the day the change is made by the Investigator ( or designee ). If the reason for the change is not apparent, a brief

    explanation for the change is to be written adjacent to the change. Changes to the e CRF 
will be electronically tracked.  
The ICON  data management department will write a  Data Management Plan, which 
will be finalized prior to performing any data validation. 
10.1 Source Documentation  
Source documents contain the results of original observations and activities of a clinical 
investigation. They are the original records in which raw data are first recorded. Source  
documents include, but are not limited to, medical records (progress notes), ECG  and 
computer printouts, s creening logs, completed scales, quality of life questionnaires, and 
recorded data from automated instruments.  
The Investigator/site personnel should maintain adequate and accurate source 
documents and study records that include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s study patients . Source data should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, 
accurate, and complete. Changes to source data should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry, and should be explained if necessary (eg, via an audit trail). 
All source documents from this study are to be maintained by the Investigator and made 
available for inspection by authorized persons. The Investigator will provide direct 
access to source documents/data for study- related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, 
and regulatory inspections. The Sponsor should verify that each patien t has consented, 
in writing, to direct access to his/her original medical records for study- related 
monitoring, audit, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection. 10.2 Case Report Form Completion and Data Management 
An e CRF will be used to store and transmit patien t information. The file structure and 
format for the e CRF will be provided by the S ponsor or its  representative and should 
be handled in accordance with the instructions provided. The eCRF must be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the Investigator. Access to the e CRF will be strictly password protected and limited to personnel directly 
participating in the study. Data should be entered into the eCRF completely by 
authorized site personnel (eg, Investigators and the Study C oordinator). The e CRF must 
be completed as soon as possible after any patient  evaluation or communication. If data 
are to be changed due to erroneous input or other reason, an electronic audit trail will 
track the changes. The e CRFs and computers that store them must be accessible to  study 
monitors and other regulatory auditors. Changes to the e CRF will be electronically 
tracked.  
Data will be entered/loaded into a validated electronic database using a clinical data management system. Computerized data cleaning checks will be used in addition to manual review to check for discrepancies and to ensure consistency of the data.

 Confidential   
    10.3 Study Files and Record Retention  
All data derived from the study will remain the property of the S ponsor. The Sponsor 
assumes accountability for actions delegated to other individuals, eg, the CRO. 
Records must be retained in accordance with the current ICH Guidelines on GCP. 
All essential study documents , including records of study patients, source documents, 
eCRFs, and the I MP inventory, must be kept on file. 
Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of setanaxib . However, essential 
documents may be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by agreement with the S ponsor. The S ponsor is responsible for 
informing the Investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
The Investigator is not to dispose of any records relevant to this study without written 
permission from the S ponsor and is to provide the S ponsor the opportunity to collect 
such records. The Investigator shall take responsibility for maintaining adequate and 
accurate source documents of all observations and data generated during this study, 
including hard copy source documents and electronic imaging files, as applicable. Such documentation is subject to inspection by the S ponsor, its representatives , and 
regulatory authorities. 
If an Investigator moves, withdraws from a study, or retires, the responsibility for 
maintaining the records may be transferred to another person who will accept 
responsibility. Notice of transfer must be made to and agreed by the Sponsor.

    11 AUDITING AND MONITORING  
Sponsor- assigned monitors will conduct regular site visits to the investigational 
facilities for the purpose of monitoring various aspects of the study, such as verifying 
that the ICFs were signed and dated before any study- specific procedure was 
performed, assessing patien t enrollment, compliance with protocol procedures, 
completeness and accuracy of data entered into the e CRFs, verification of eCRF data 
against original source documents, and occurrence of AEs. The Investigator must agree 
to Sponsor-author ized personnel having direct access to the clinical (or associated) files 
and clinical study supplies (dispensing and storage areas) to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, and the Investigator will assist with the Sponsor’s monitoring 
activities.  
Quality control will occur at  each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are 
reliable and have been processed correctly. The S ponsor should ensure oversight of any 
study- related duties and functions carried out on its behalf, including study- related 
duties and functions that are subcontracted to another party by the S ponsor’s contracted 
CRO(s).  
The eCRFs should be completed in a timely manner and on an ongoing basis to allow 
regular review by the study monitor. 
Details describing the strategy, responsibilities, and requirements of the study 
monitoring are provided in the study Medical Monitoring Plan.  
The purpose of an audit is to assess whether ethics, regulatory, and quality requirements are being fulfilled. The S ponsor or its representative may conduct audits at the 
investigative sites including, but not limited to, drug supply, presence of required documents, the informed consent process, and comparison of e CRFs with source 
documents. Government  regulatory authorities may also inspect the Investigator during 
or after the study. The  Investigator ( or designee ) should contact the Sponsor/CRO 
immediately  if this occurs. All medical records (progress notes) must be available for 
audit. The I nvestigator must agree to participate with audits conducted at a convenient 
time in a reasonable manner.  
11.1 Risk and Quality Tolerance Limits  
Perceived risks and quality tolerance limits (QTLs) will be identified and documented in the Protocol Risk Evaluation Plan before the start of the study. 
The Sponsor will review risk control measures periodically to ascertain whether the 
implemented quality management activities remain effective and relevant. The quality 
management approach and any important deviations from the predefined QTLs (and remedial actions adopted) will be described in the CSR.  
11.2 Protocol Adherence and Deviations  
The Investigator and site personnel should conduct the study in compliance with the 
protocol and should use continuous vigilance to identify and report protocol deviations. 
Sponsor Name: Calliditas Therapeutics  Suisse SA

 Confidential   
    A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures defined in the protocol that may be on the part of the Investigator, the site 
personnel, or the patien t. 
Important protocol deviations are a subset of protocol deviations that may significantly impact the completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a patien t's rights, safety, or well -being. For example, important 
protocol deviations may include enrolling patien ts in violation of key eligibility criteria 
designed to ensure a specific patien t population or failing to collect data necessary to 
interpret primary endpoints, as this may compromise the scientific value of the study. 
The Investigator should not implement any deviation from the protocol without 
agreement from the S ponsor and prior review and approval from the IRB/IEC of an 
amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to a study 
patien t, or when the change involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the 
study, such as a change in a monitor or phone number. 
In the event of an important protocol deviation, the I nvestigator will discuss the 
deviation with the Sponsor’s M edical Monitor and will come to an agreement as to 
whether the patien t should be withdrawn from the study due to the important protocol 
deviation.

    12 AMENDMENTS  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study 
patien ts, may be made only by the S ponsor. A protocol change intended to eliminate an 
apparent immediate hazard to patien ts should be implemented immediately.  
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The written amendment must be submitted to the IRB/IEC , and the Investigator must 
await approval before implementing the changes. The S ponsor will submit protocol 
amendments to the appropriate regulatory authorities for approval. 
The current version of the ICF will require similar modification if the IRB/IEC, 
Investigator, and/or Sponsor, judge the amendment to the protocol to substantially 
change the study design and/or increase the potential risk to the patien t and/or impact 
the patien t's involvement as a study patien t. In such cases, the ICF  will be renewed for 
enrolled patients before their continued participation in the study.

the participation in the study at an I nvestigator’s site at any time. In terminating the 
study, the S ponsor and the Investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given 
to the protection of the patien ts’ interests.  
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended for any reason, 
the Sponsor/I nvestigator/site personnel should promptly inform the study patien ts and 
should assure appropriate therapy and follow -up for the patien ts. Where required by the 
applicable regulatory requirements, the IRB/IEC should be informed promptly and be provided with a detailed written explanation of the termination or suspension. 
If the Investigator terminates or suspends a study without prior agreement of the 
Sponsor, the I nvestigator should inform the site personnel. T he Investigator/site 
personnel should promptly inform the S ponsor and the IRB/IEC. The Investigator/site 
personnel should also provide the S ponsor and the IRB/IEC a detailed written 
explanation of the termination or suspension.

    15 CONFIDENTIALITY  
All information generated in this study is considered highly confidential and must not 
be disclosed to any person or entity not directly involved with the study unless prior written consent is gained from the S ponsor. However, authorized regulatory officials, 
IRB/IEC personnel, the Sponsor and its authorized representatives are allowed full 
access to the records.  
All study patien ts must be informed that their  personal study- related data will be used 
by the S ponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure 
must also be explained to the patien t, who will be required to give consent for their data 
to be used as described in the ICF. The patien ts must be informed that their  medical 
records may be examined by auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the Sponsor, by appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory 
authorities.  In case of any data security breach, this will be reported to authorities in 
line with local requirements.  
Identification of patien ts and eCRFs shall be by unique patien t identification numbers 
(such  as screening or r andomization number s) only. All personal identifiers according 
to applicable regulations (eg, name, phone number) must be redacted permanently by the site personnel and replaced with the patien t’s unique identification number in all 
records and data before transfer to the Sponsor ( or designee ). 
All personal details will be treated as confidential by the Investigator and staff at ICON .

    17.2 APPENDIX II – Detection and Management of Suspected or Confirmed 
Cases of Drug -Induced Liver Injury  
Particular attention will be given to the detection and management of suspected or 
confirmed  cases  of DILI. 
If any of the following laboratory results or clinical signs or symptoms are obtained during the study, the Investigator will instruct the patient to return to the study center 
within 24 to 48 hours of receipt of the laboratory test results to undergo a retest. 
• AST or ALT ≥3×ULN  
• AST or ALT >2×Baseline 
• Total bilirubin >2×ULN 
• INR >1.5 (except for patients on anticoagulant therapy) 
• Clinical signs or symptoms that are, in the opinion of the Investigator, consistent 
with hepatitis (such as right upper quadrant discomfort, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, rash, or eosinophilia >5%) or drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Isolated eosinophilia >5% without clinical signs or symptoms that are consistent with hepatitis or hepatotoxicity by the Investigator’s medical judg ment , should not 
be considered suspected DILI (sDILI). Retesting of eosinophilia (>5%) will only be required in case this is observed in combination with at least one of the other criteria listed above.  
Baseline values for liver tests (ALT, AST, and total bilirubin) are determined by averaging the values obtained at Screening and Baseline/Day 1 to obtain the arithmetic 
mean . 
The results of the Test and Retest will be checked to determine if they meet the criteria 
in A or B, which are based on the patient’s ALT and AST levels at Baseline, or C  
below: 
17.2.1 Criteria for Close Monitoring of Liver Biochemistry and IMP Action  
A) For patients with ALT and/or AST <ULN at study start  (Baseline Values), unless 
an alternative cause for the combination of laboratory abnormalities is  immediately  
apparent  (and documented) at the time of the laboratory test elevations  in the 
opinion of the Investigator, close monitoring for sDILI (as  described in 
Appendix II, Section  17.2.2) will be performed in patients with any of the following 
criteria (all confirmed by repeat testing):  
a. ALT or AST >3 ×ULN  
b. Total bilirubin >2 ×ULN  
c. INR >1.5 (except for patients on anticoagulant therapy)

    d. Clinical signs or symptoms that are, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
consistent with hepatitis (such as right upper quadrant discomfort, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, rash, or eosinophilia >5% provided the latter is in combination with any of the other cri teria listed under A -a, b, c 
or d).  
B) For patients with  ALT and/or AST between ≥ULN and < 3×ULN at study start  
(Baseline Values), unless an alternative cause for the combination of laboratory abnormalities is immediately apparent  at the time of the laboratory test elevations  
in the opinion of the Investigator (and documented), close observation for DILI (as described in Appendix II,  Section  17.2.2) will be performed in patients with any 
of the following criteria (all confirmed by repeat testing): 
a. ALT or AST >2×Baseline at any time (see Figure 2 for illustration)  
b. Total bilirubin >2×ULN 
c. INR >1.5 (except for patients on anticoagulant therapy) 
d. Clinical signs or symptoms that are, in the opinion of the Investigator, consistent with hepatitis (such as right upper quadrant discomfort, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, rash, or eosinophilia >5% provided the latter is in combination with an y of the other criteria listed under A -a, b, c 
or d).  
During the close monitoring period in A  and B , IMP can be continued, unless: 
• The patient is symptomatic in addition to having elevated laboratory parameters 
• Close Monitoring is not possible 
• Criteria C  of Appendix II (see below) are met and no other cause for laboratory 
abnormalities is clinically apparent and documented by the Investigator in the study documents 
• At the discretion of the Investigator 
C) For patients meeting any of the following events, IMP will be discontinued when 
no other cause for the combination of laboratory abnormalities is immediately apparent:  
a. ALT or AST >5 ×Baseline  
b. ALT or AST >10 ×ULN  
c. ALT or AST >3 ×Baseline (see Figure 3 for illustration) with 1  or more of 
the following: 
i. Total bilirubin >2 ×ULN

    ii. Total bilirubin >1.5× Baseline and >ULN  
iii. INR >1.5 (except for patients on anticoagulant therapy) 
iv. Appearance of clinical signs or symptoms that are, in the opinion of 
the Investigator, consistent with drug-induced hepatotoxicity 
d. ALT or AST >Baseline with any 2  or more of the following: 
i. Total bilirubin >2 ×ULN or 1.5× Baseline  
ii. INR>1.5 (except for patients on anticoagulant therapy) 
iii. Appearance of clinical signs or symptoms that are, in the opinion of the Investigator, consistent with drug-induced hepatotoxicity 
If the above criteria in C  are met, the Investigator will instruct the patient to discontinue 
IMP administration and return to the study center within 2 days of receipt of the 
laboratory test results to undergo a retest and additional investigations (ie, close monitoring) to assess for s DILI.  IMP cannot be reintroduced. 
Any s uspected or confirmed DILI event , defined as events meeting the criteria in A , B, 
or C above, will be closely monitored by the Investigator and the IDMC and reported 
to the Sponsor as an AESI  following the same procedure as for SAEs.

17.2.2 Close Monitoring 
1. Monitor patient twice  or 3 times  week ly until liver biochemistries (ALT, AST, 
ALP , total bilirubin ), and coagulation profile ( INR) resolve, stabilize or return to 
within Baseline values . Additional tests (eg , conjugated bilirubin) should also be 
obtained, as appropriate, at the discretion of the Investigator. 
2. Monitor liver biochemistries  and coagulation profile  once a week or less according 
to the Investigator ’s judg ment  if the abnormalities stabilize , resolve or return to 
within Baseline values , or IMP has been discontinued and the patient is 
asymptomatic . 
3. Close Monitoring can be stopped based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment once 
the abnormalities stabilize, resolve or return to within Baseline values; or when 
there is an alternative documented cause to explain the deterioration. 
4. Obtain a detailed history for symptoms assessment: appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of hepatitis (such as right upper quadrant discomfort, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, rash, or eosinophilia >5%). If a patient is symptomatic in ad dition to having elevated laboratory parameters, the drug must be 
discontinued immediately, and a suspected DILI evaluation must be performed. 
5. Obtain a more detailed history of prior or concomitant diseases.

    6. Obtain a history for concomitant medications, acetaminophen, dietary supplements, 
herba l remedies, other over -the- counter medications, recreational drug use, and 
special diets . 
7. If possible, quantify the alcohol consumption to assess for alcoholic hepatitis. 
8. Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents. 
9. If INR is also elevated, a trial of intravenous vitamin K administration may be considered, especially in cholestatic patients.  
Follow- Up procedures for patient(s) who meet suspected DILI evaluation criteria  in A, 
B, or C  (laboratory analyses are performed at the central laboratory) : 
Viral hepatitis serology including: 
1. Hepatitis A IgM antibody. 
2. Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM). 
3. Hepatitis C RNA . 
4. Hepatitis E IgM antibody. 
5. Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody. 
6. Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, obtain 
heterophile antibody or monospot testing); however, IgM antibodies must be sent 
out as soon as possible. 
Follow-up signs and symptoms consistent with potential immune mediated injury and, 
if relevant , monitor until the abnormalities resolve and to EoT V isit. 
1. Fever, malaise, pruritus, etc.  
2. Rash .  
3. Edema.  
4. Lymphadenopathy.

    3. A liver biopsy at the discretion of the Investigator. 
4. Assess for peripheral eosinophilia . Investigators are also encouraged to obtain a 
skin biopsy in subjects who have liver enzyme elevation together with eosinophilia . 
5. Assess for hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy, and biliary tract disease . 
As long as Criteria A, B or C are met WITHOUT identification and documentation of 
an alternative cause, these abnormal liver tests will be considered suspected DILI and be reported to the Sponsor as AESI and go for adjudication . Once an alternative cause 
has been identified and documented, for the laboratory abnormalities qualifying Criteria A, B, or C  of Appendix II, the alternative clinical event is to be reported as an 
AE/SAE.  
In addition, undertake the following for patients who meet the stopping criteria for both 
ALT and total bilirubin OR experiences clinical symptoms of hepatitis:  
1. Antinuclear antibody, antismooth muscle antibody, Type  1 anti -liver kidney 
microsomal antibodies and quantitative total immunoglobulin G (IgG or gamma globulins). Analyses are performed at the central laboratory.  
2. If required , evaluation of competing undiagnosed liver disease (hemochromatosis, 
Wilson’s disease, alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency). 
3. Serum acetaminophen levels OR serum acetaminophen adducts by high performance liquid chromatography assay (quantifies potential acetaminophen 
contribution to liver injury in patients with definite or likely acetaminophen use in 
the preceding week).  
4. Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized tomography) to evaluate liver disease at the discretion of the Investigator.

    17.3 APPENDIX III – MELD Score  
The MELD score will be calculated based on the results from the liver biochemistry 
(total bilirubin), biochemistry (creatinine, and sodium if MELD score >11), and hematology (INR) blood samples, according to the following formulas: 
a. MELD  = 3.78×ln[serum bilirubin (mg/dL)] + 11.2×ln[INR] + 9.57×ln[serum 
creatinine (mg/dL)] + 6.43 
b. When MELD>11: MELD –Na = MELD + 1.32×(137 – Na (mmol/L) – 
(0.033× MELD ×(137 – Na (mmol/L))) )

WHC 
including 
MHE  Description  Suggested Operative 
Criteria  Comment  
Unimpaired  No encephalopathy at all, 
no history of HE  Tested and proved to be 
normal   
Minimal  Psychometric or 
neuropsychological 
alterations of tests 
exploring psychomotor speed/executive functions or neurophysiological alterations without 
clinical evidence of 
mental change  Abnormal results of 
established psychometric or neuropsychological tests 
without clinical manifestations  No universal criteria for 
diagnosis  
Local standards and expertise required  
Grade I  • Trivial lack of 
awareness  
• Euphoria or anxiety  
• Shortened attention 
span 
• Impairment of addition 
or subtraction  
• Altered sleep rhythm  Despite oriented in time 
and space (see below), the patient appears to have some cognitive/behavioral 
decay with respect to his 
or her standard on clinical examination or to the caregivers  Clinical findings usually 
not reproducible  
Grade II  • Lethargy or apathy  
• Disorientation for time  
• Obvious personality change  
• Inappropriate behavior  
• Dyspraxia  
• Asterixis  Disoriented for time (at 
least 3 of the followings 
are wrong: day of the month, day of the week, month, season, or year) ± 
the other mentioned symptoms  Clinical findings variable, 
but reproducible to some 
extent  
Grade III  • Somnolence to 
semistupor  
• Responsive to stimuli  
• Confused  
• Gross disorientation  
• Bizarre behavior  Disoriented also for space 
(at least 3 of the following 
wrongly reported: country, 
state [or region], city, or place) ± the other 
mentioned symptoms  Clinical findings 
reproducible to some extent  
Grade IV  Coma  Does not respond even to 
painful stimuli  Comatose state usually 
reproducible  
HE=hepatic encephalopathy; MHE=minimal hepatic encephalopathy; WHC=West Haven Criteria  
All conditions are required to be related to liver insufficiency and/or portosystemic shunting.

    17.5 APPENDIX V – Child -Pugh  Classification of Severity of Cirrhosis 
Modified Child- Pugh classification of the severity of liver disease according to the 
degree of ascites, the serum concentrations of bilirubin and albumin, the prothrombin 
time, and the degree of encephalopathy is assessed as described in the table below . 
A total Child -Turcotte- Pugh score of 5 to 6 is considered Child- Pugh class A (well -
compensated disease), 7 to 9 is class B (significant functional compromise), and 10 to 15 is class C (decompensated disease). These classes correlate with one- and two- year 
patient survival: class A: 100 % and 85%; class B: 80%  and 60%; and class C: 45%  and 
35%. 
 
Parameter  Points assigned  
1 2 3 
Ascites  Absent  Slight  Moderate  
Bilirubin  <2 mg/dL (<34.2 
µmol/L)  2 to 3 mg/dL (34.2 to 
51.3 µmol/L)  >3 mg/dL (>51.3 
µmol/L)  
Albumin  >3.5 g/dL (35 
g/L) 2.8 to 3.5 g/dL (28 to 
35 g/L)  <2.8 g/dL (<28 
g/L) 
Prothrombin time (seconds 
over control) or  <4 4 to 6  >6 
INR <1.7 1.7 to 2.3  >2.3 
Encephalopathy  None  Grade 1 to 2  Grade 3 to 4  
INR=international normalized ratio.

For guidanceregarding consent issues, process approaches, and sample language see the Sample Repository/Registry/Bank ConsentTemplate.Upon arriving at the lab, all participants' proof of age will be checked and each will be asked to sign an informed consent formdescribing the nature of the experiment and outlining all of the conditions for participation. Consent will be obtained by the PrincipalInvestigator. The consent form provides the potential volunteer with information about the study (e.g., who is conducting it, contactinformation for the investigators and medical staff, how it is funded, where it will take place, and the purpose of the study), what will berequired of the volunteer (e.g., time commitment, alcohol administration, and dietary, drug, and alcohol use restrictions prior tosessions), the risks to the volunteer (e.g., MRI scanning), the rights of the volunteer (e.g., confidentiality and voluntary participation),and the benefits of participating (e.g., monetary compensation and scientific knowledge). The informed consent form will beexplained thoroughly and signed on-site. Each volunteer will receive a copy of their informed consent document and will sign adocument indicating its receipt. The PI will review all screening materials and sign off on consent forms. After consent is obtained,participants will provide a breath sample to verify a zero BrAC and urine sample to test for pregnancy and other drug use. Anyonedisqualified for a positive test result, or declining to continue at any time after appearing at the research site, will receive a proratedpayment for sessions completed and dismissed. Transportation will be provided.Our previous research in this area finds that participants are quite comfortable with the testing protocol and the reporting ofinformation. Any complaints from the participants regarding the administration of this protocol will be responded to immediately. ThePI will be informed of these issues, which will also be documented.Request for Waiver of Informed Consent ProcessIf you are requesting IRB approval to waive the requirement for the informed consent process, or to alter some or all of theelements of informed consent, complete, Section 1 and Section 2 below.Note: The IRB does not approve waiver or alteration of the consent process for greater than minimal risk research, exceptfor planned emergency/acute care research as provided under FDA regulations.

Request for Waiver of SignaturesIf you are requesting IRB approval to waive the requirement for signatures on informed consent forms, your researchactivities must fit into one of three regulatory options:1. The only record linking the participant and the research would be the consent document, and the principal risk would bepotential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality (e.g., a study that involves participants who use illegal drugs).2. The research presents no more than minimal risk to the participant and involves no procedures for which written consentis normally required outside of the research context (e.g., a cover letter on a survey, or a phone script).3. The participant (or legally authorized representative) is a member of a distinct cultural group or community in whichsigning forms is not the norm, the research presents no more than minimal risk to the subject, and there is an appropriatealternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.Select the option below that best fits your study. If the IRB approves a waiver of signatures, participants must still be provided oral or written information about the study.To ensure you include required elements in your consent document, use the Cover Letter Template as a guide. There isan English and a Spanish version.
 Option 1Describe how your study meets these criteria:a) The only record linking the participant and the research would be the consent document:b) The principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality (i.e., a study that involves subjectswho use illegal drugs).Under this option, each participant (or legally authorized representative) must be asked whether (s)he wants to sign aconsent document; if the participant agrees to sign a consent document, only an IRB approved version should beused.Option 2Describe how your study meets these criteria:a) The research presents no more than minimal risk to the participant:b) Involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context (i.e. a coverletter on a survey, or a phone script):Option 3Describe how your study meets these criteria:a) The subject (or legally authorized representative) is a member of a distinct cultural group or community in whichsigning forms is not the norm.b) The research presents no more than minimal risk to the subject.c) There is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.

You should identify gaps in knowledge that should be addressedand explain how your research will address those gaps or contribute to existing knowledge in this area. For interventional research,search PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov for duplicative ongoing and completed trials with same condition and intervention(s).Alcohol abuse inflicts enormous physical, emotional, and financial burdens on the individual and society at large. Knowing who is at riskfor alcohol abuse, and why, is crucial for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Alcohol abuse has beentraditionally considered a male-oriented problem and as a consequence research on risk factors specific to women has been minimal.However, the sex gap in substance abuse is closing rapidly, and findings from both animal and human studies suggest that females areactually more vulnerable to drug use than males. As such, there is an urgent need to identify sex differences in risk factors for alcoholabuse in order to develop sex-specific prevention and treatment efforts. One clear candidate risk factor is poor inhibitory control, bothin terms of baseline levels of inhibition and sensitivity to the disinhibiting effects of alcohol. Recent studies suggest that sex hormonesaffect inhibitory control in drug-free individuals, potentially contributing to sex differences in baseline levels of inhibition. However, thedegree to which fluctuations in sex hormones influence sex differences in inhibition-related brain function in sober and intoxicatedindividuals is not known. The proposed project will determine the neural and hormonal mechanisms underlying sex differences insensitivity to the disinhibiting effects of alcohol in heavy drinkers.ObjectivesList your research objectives. Please include a summary of intended research objectives in the box below.The overall objective of the research is to identify hormonal determinants of alcohol effects on brain activation during responseinhibition (BARI) in young adult female and male drinkers. BARI will be assessed using fMRI during performance of the stop signaltask. This task reliably activates right-lateralized prefrontal regions implicated in inhibitory control. We will assess BARI during IValcohol (60mg%) and saline infusion in women during the early follicular and mid-luteal phases and in men at matched intervals. Aim 1: To determine the influence of circulating sex hormones on BARI responses to alcohol. Based on the positive relation betweenestradiol and BARI in sober heavy drinking women, we hypothesize that baseline levels of estradiol will be positively related to BARIfollowing alcohol.Aim 2: To determine the effects of menstrual cycle phase on BARI responses to alcohol. We hypothesize that women will be moresensitive to the impairing effects of alcohol on BARI in the early follicular phase, when hormone levels are low.Aim 3: To determine the degree to which alcohol effects on sex hormones influence alcohol effects on BARI. We hypothesize thatless alcohol-induced increase in estradiol will predict greater alcohol-induced decrease in BARI.Aim 4: To determine sex differences in BARI responses to alcohol. Based on our previous findings that heavy drinking women showless BARI than men when sober, we hypothesize that women will display greater alcohol-induced decrease in BARI than men, and thatthe sex difference will be most pronounced for women in the early follicular phase.Study DesignDescribe and explain the study design (e.g., observational, secondary analysis, single/double blind, parallel, crossover, deception, etc.).Clinical Research: Indicate whether subjects will be randomized and whether subjects will receive any placebo.Community-Based Participatory Research: If you are conducting community-based participatory research (CBPR), describestrategies for involvement of community members in the design and implementation of the study, and dissemination of results fromthe study.Qualitative research: Indicate ranges where flexibility is needed, if a fixed interview transcript is not available, describe interviewtopics including the most sensitive potential questions.Research Repositories: If the purpose of this submission is to establish a Research Repository (bank, registry) and the materialyou plan to collect is already available from a commercial supplier, clinical lab, or established IRB approved research repository,provide scientific justification for establishing an additional repository collecting duplicate material. Describe the repository designand operating procedures. For relevant information to include, see the UK Research Biospecimen Bank Guidance or the UKResearch Registry Guidance.This study will use a within- and between-subjects, placebo-controlled, single-blind design in a sample of female (N=30) and male(N=30) young adult heavy drinkers. Subjects will attend four fMRI sessions (two in the early follicular phase and two in the mid-lutealSection 9 Page 1 of 1150301

phase for women, and at matched intervals for men) in which they perform the stop signal task and a resting state task whileundergoing either IV alcohol (60mg%) or saline infusion (placebo). Alcohol and saline sessions within each phase will be separated by24-48 hours. Dose and phase order will be counter-balanced. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and during infusion toassess levels of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. The primary outcome measure will be brain activation during responseinhibition.AttachmentsSubject Recruitment Methods & AdvertisingDescribe how the study team will identify and recruit subjects.

Subjects may be recruited through paid print and digital advertisements, includingbrochures, magazines, newspaper (e.g., Herald Leader, Bluegrass Area, Courier Journal, Cincinnati Enquirer, Health & Wellness,Chevy Chaser, Hamburg Journal, Business Lexington, or other publications in the surrounding region e.g., Bluegrass Regional print &digital ads, may include Appalachian counties), Radio (e.g., Sirius, Clear Channel, Cumulus, LM Communications, Public Radio,Pandora, etc.), Television spots, scrolling information on community stations, and theater screens. Recruitment ads may also appearon billboards, Lextran buses, taxicabs, other transportation methods, and Craig’sList. The study will employ a pre-screening eligibilitysurvey to determine if a volunteer meets basic inclusion/exclusion criteria. We will build and administer the eligibility survey on UK’sREDCap which provides HIPAA compliant storage on UK servers and encrypted transmission of survey responses. The link will beincluded in study information sent to ResearchMatch participants who have indicated interest in the study. Before redirecting thevolunteer outside of ResearchMatch and to the REDCap survey, the volunteer is once again asked to confirm their interest incompleting the pre-screening survey. Interested individuals will contact the experimenter by phone. The following initial inclusioncriteria will be obtained over the phone as preliminary screening to be verified at the intake session: i) Confirmation of age (21-29). Volunteers will be told to bring proof of age to the laboratory (e.g., driver's license or passport).ii) General health status. Callers will answer questions from the Telephone Screening Interview.iii) Contraindication for fMRI. Callers will answer questions from the MR screening form to confirm that they do not have any metal inthe body. iv) Drinking status. Volunteers will be asked how many alcoholic beverages they consume in a typical week, and how often theyconsume 4/5 (for women/men) or more drinks in 2 hours. They will also answer questions from the Alcohol Use DisordersIdentification Test.v) No history of drug or alcohol use disorder. Callers will be asked if they are currently or have previously sought treatment for a drug oralcohol use disorder.vi) Pregnancy. Women will be asked if they are currently pregnant or breastfeeding. It will be explained that no pregnant women orwomen who are breastfeeding can participate in the study. Women will be told that they will be required to submit a simple urinesample for a pregnancy test (testing human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) levels) and that a non-negative result would disqualify themfrom participation. vii) Urine drug screen. It will be explained to subjects that they must submit a urine sample prior to each session that will be screenedfor drug use that would disqualify them from participating.viii) Zero BrAC check. Callers will be informed in advance that they must have a zero BrAC and will be given a breath test when theyarrive at the experimental site.ix) Regular menstrual cycle and birth control. Women will be asked if they have regular menstrual cycles, and the typical length of theirmenstrual cycles. They will also be asked if they are using any type of hormonal contraception. Any persons excluded from participation during phone screening will simply be thanked for their interest. Appropriate volunteers will begiven a general description of the study and the criteria for participation will be explained. They will then be scheduled and instructed toabstain from alcohol and other drugs for 24 hours. Prospective subjects are also told that they could receive alcohol during the testsessions so that alternate transportation home is provided.This study will be advertised on recruitment internet webpages in digital or video form (e.g., UKclinicalresearch.com,ResearchMatch.org, CenterWatch.com, CISCRP, UK, CCTS and may utilize Google Adwords).

List medications that are explicitly forbidden or permitted during study participation.Orientation Session. During the first session, study procedures will be explained, and participants will read and sign the consent form.They will be told that the study is examining the influence of sex (male/female), sex hormones, and menstrual cycle phase on thebrain’s response to alcohol, and they will be informed that the infusion will contain alcohol or saline (inactive substance). Participantswill complete self-report impulsivity measures, including the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS11; Patton et al. 1995) and the UPPS-P(Whiteside and Lynam 2001), as well as a practice round on the stop signal task. Female participants will be shown how to conduct theat-home luteinizing hormone (LH) tests (see below). Participants will agree not to use alcohol or drugs for 24 hours before eachsession, and fast for 2 hours before each session. Determination of menstrual cycle phase. Women will complete a guided calendar-based interview to determine average menstrualcycle length and to estimate the onset of next menses (Roche and King 2015). Women will be randomly assigned to start in either theearly follicular (2-7 days following the onset of menses) or the mid-luteal (5-10 days following ovulation) phase. Blood samplescollected during each session will be used to retrospectively confirm that the targeted menstrual cycle phase was achieved. Ovulationwill be confirmed by at-home urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) assays. Beginning on day 7 of their cycle, participants will complete theat-home LH assays every day, until a positive test is confirmed. They will be provided with small (2oz) cups and lids, as well as 20 LHtests. Each morning, they will use the cups to collect a small sample of urine. They will place the LH test (a short, paper stick) into theurine sample for 3 seconds, and then lie the test flat on the cup lid. Three minutes later, they will take a picture of the test and send itvia text message to the Research Assistant. The RA will confirm whether the test is positive or negative. If negative, the RA will ask theparticipant to test again the next day, and if positive, the RA will inform the participant that she can stop the LH tests. Brain Imaging Sessions. Sessions will take place in Kastle Hall, the Clinical Research Unit (CRU), and the Magnetic ResonanceImaging and Spectroscopy Center (MRISC) at the University of Kentucky. Participants will report to the lab in Kastle Hall and providebreath and urine samples to detect recent drug use or pregnancy. Positive pregnancy tests will result in exclusion. If a subject testspositive for a drug, and it is determined that the drug is not regularly used, the session is rescheduled. If subjects test positive asecond time, they are discontinued. Participants will complete an MR scanner safety questionnaire and then complete a pre-scanpractice round of the stop signal task. Subjects will be escorted to the CRU, where a nurse will draw a blood sample to assessbaseline hormone levels. The nurse will then place an intravenous catheter in the dominant arm for delivery of infusion. Participants willthen be escorted to the MRISC and positioned on the scanner bed. The nurse will connect the IV catheter via a length of tubing to thepump located outside the scanning room. Subjects will complete baseline subjective measures of drug effects: the Biphasic AlcoholEffects Scale (Martin et al. 1993) and the Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ). The infusion will begin, and 15 minutes later participantswill complete the stop signal task (20 minutes), subjective measures (2 minutes), and a resting state scan (8 minutes). Pulsed arterialspin labeling (PASL) scans (6 min each) will also be acquired to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF; ml/100 g/min) using aone-compartment model (Kareken et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2011) at baseline and following task performance. These scans will beconducted to ensure that alcohol infusion does not significantly affect global rCBF. Blood samples will be drawn for hormonal assaysimmediately prior to each PASL scan, and then placed on ice. During resting state scans, participants will be instructed to remainawake with eyes open, fixated on a crosshair, 'not think about anything in particular', and remain still. After resting state scans,participants will be asked to confirm that they did not fall asleep during the scan. Head movement will be minimized by detailedinstructions to participants and a conformal pillow fitted to the participant's head using a vacuum pump to withdraw air from the pillow.Physiological sensors for heart rate and respirations will monitor participant status during scanning, and will be incorporated inreconstruction. Participants are told to immediately alert the technician if they experience discomfort or feel unwell, in which case thescan will be stopped and the participant removed from the scanner. The entire scan should require 1 hour. Immediately following thescan, the nurse will draw a second blood sample to assess acute alcohol effects on hormone levels. Imaging Parameters. Imaging will be performed using a state-of-the-art Siemens Prisma 3T MRI scanner using a 64-channel headcoil. BOLD echo-planar imaging (EPI) scans will be acquired for each task-based functional scan (XYZ dimension = 96*96*51; FOV[RL, AP, FH - mm] = 240, 240, 127; slice thickness [mm] = 2.5; gap thickness = 0; in-plane resolution [mm] = 2.5*25; echo time [ms] =30; repetition time [ms] = 1500, flip angle [degrees] = 70; multiband factor = 3) and resting state scan (echo time [ms] = 29; repetitiontime [ms] = 760, flip angle [degrees] = 54; multiband factor = 5). High-resolution T1-weighted structural scans will also be acquired forco-registration and normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate system (XYZ dimension = 320*320*208; FOV[ap, fh, rl - mm] = 256, 256, 166; slice thickness [mm] = 0.8; gap thickness = 0; in-plane resolution [mm] = 0.8*0.8; echo time [ms] = 3;repetition time [ms] = 2000).Infusion Procedure. The University of Kentucky Hospital Pharmacy Investigational Drug Service will prepare all infusion solutions (6%alcohol in half-normal saline and half-normal saline only), and alcohol and half-normal saline will be infused by a nurse from the CRUusing the Computer-assisted Alcohol Infusion System (CAIS). The alternate method of administration in alcohol challenge studies isby oral ingestion. Due to uncontrollable gastric absorption kinetics, substantial variability in the time course of breath alcoholconcentration (BrAC) is unavoidable with oral administration. Using IV alcohol infusion, we can provide precisely the same time courseof brain exposure to alcohol in every subject. We have successfully administered alcohol intravenously in the scanner in the pastSection 9 Page 4 of 1150301
CLOSED
(Weafer et al. 2018). The infusion profile will be customized for each participant to achieve a linear ascension in BrAC to 60mg% in 15min, followed by a clamping of BrAC at 60mg% for 40 minutes, allowing for constant exposure throughout BOLD imaging. Saline(placebo) infusions will follow the same time profile. This dose was chosen because it has been shown to reliably affect activation ofinhibitory networks in previous fMRI studies (Gan et al. 2014; Kareken et al. 2013).Once the scanning session is complete, the nurse will remove the intravenous catheters and the subject will be escorted back toKastle Hall. We will obtain a breath alcohol sample and subjects will be allowed to leave the laboratory when BrAC is below 20mg%(NIAAA guidelines). If subjects are not able to arrange alternative transportation, we will provide transportation home. After the finalimaging session, participants will attend a debriefing session, either in person or over the phone, in which the purpose of the study andthe infusions they received will be told to them, and they can ask questions about the study.AttachmentsData Collection & Research MaterialsIn this section, please provide the following:Describe all sources or methods for obtaining research materials about or from living individuals (such as specimens, records,surveys, interviews, participant observation, etc.), and explain why this information is needed to conduct the study.For each source or method described, please list or attach all data to be collected (such as genetic information, interview scripts,survey tools, data collection forms for existing data, etc.).If you will conduct a record or chart review, list the beginning and end dates of the records you will view.The research material consists of subjects' questionnaire scores, diagnostic test scores, urine analyses for drug metabolites and urinehuman chorionic gonadotrophin (pregnancy), fMRI data (BOLD, CBF), hormonal assays (estradiol, progesterone, testosterone),behavioral performance on the stop signal task, and subjective reports (BAES, DEQ). Drug metabolites tested include: amphetamineand amphetamine salts (e.g., methylphenidate), barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiates, and tetrahydrocannabinol. (Noarchival records or other data will be used). Authentication of drug and pregnancy tests is assured by purchase only from reputablecommercial dealers who must adhere and document specific quality standards. The Timeline Follow-back (TLFB) and Alcohol UseDisorders Identification Test (AUDIT) will be used to provide valid and reliable assessments of drinking habits and problems, includingtypical frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption (number of standard drinks). These measures will be used to confirm that allparticipants meet criteria for heavy drinking (i.e., 10-30 drinks per week and at least two binge episodes (4/5 drinks or more forwomen/men in two hours) in a 30 day period on the TLFB and a score of 8 or above on the AUDIT). Trait impulsivity measures will alsobe assessed, including the UPPS-P and BIS-11. Dependent Measures: Subjects will complete the following measures during each brain imaging session.Stop Signal Task: While in the scanner, participants will complete three runs of the stop signal task, adapted and validated for use infMRI (Kareken et al. 2013). Participants are instructed to respond as quickly as possible when a 'go' target appears (left or right arrow)by hitting the corresponding left or right button on the MRI-compatible keypad. They are also instructed to inhibit that response when a'stop' signal (a red vertical arrow) occasionally occurs. Each run consists of 80 'go' trials and 40 'stop' trials. The duration of the delayto presentation of the stop signal following the go signal is adjusted until the participant is able to successfully inhibit the response on50% of trials. The final mean delay of the stop signal, based on this 50% success rate criterion, is subtracted from the mean goreaction time, providing the stop signal reaction time (SSRT), which is the behavioral measure of response inhibition. The BOLDcontrast of interest will be activation during correct inhibition trials compared to correct go trials [StopInh>Go]. Hormone assays: Serum assays of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone will be analyzed by the CCTS Biomarker Analysis Lab. Subjective Alcohol Effects: Subjective reports of mood and drug effects will be assessed using the BAES (a 14-item scale thatmeasures stimulation and sedation) and the DEQ (a 100 mm visual analogue scale that measures the following: feel substance, likesubstance, and want more of the substance). Both scales have well-documented validity.AttachmentsAttach TypeFile NameDataCollectionUPPS-P-PaperCopy.docDataCollectionAUDIT.docxDataCollectionBAESPaperCopy.docDataCollectionDEQ paper version.docDataCollectionTLFB.docxDataCollectionBIS questionnaire.pdfResourcesDescribe the availability of the resources and adequacy of the facilities that you will use to perform the research.

Assessthe seriousness and likelihood of each risk.Which risks may affect a subject’s willingness to participate in the study?Describe likely adverse effects of drugs, biologics, devices or procedures participants may encounter while in the study.Qualitative research - describe ethical issues that could arise while conducting research in the field and strategies you may use tohandle those situations.Describe any steps to mitigate these risks.BenefitsDescribe potential direct benefits to study participants – including diagnostic or therapeutic, physical, psychological or emotional,learning benefits. This cannot include incentives or payments.State if there are no direct benefits.Describe potential benefits to society and/or general knowledge to be gained.Describe why potential benefits are reasonable in relation to potential risks. If applicable, justify why risks to vulnerable subjects arereasonable to potential benefits.The potential risks in this study are minimal and involve risks of 1) confidentiality; 2) the fMRI procedure; 3) insertion of intravenouscatheters and needles (for IV alcohol administration and blood draws); 4) administration of alcohol; and 5) pregnancy testing.1. Confidentiality: Laboratory personnel strictly maintain confidentiality, and records are kept in a secure location. However, there is arisk that a volunteer's Protected Health Information (PHI) may be seen by others. PHI is considered individually identifiable healthinformation transmitted or maintained in any form (i.e., electronic means, on paper, or through oral communication) that relates to thepast, present, or future physical or mental health conditions of an individual that may be used or disclosed. The following PHI will becollected as part of this project: name, address, telephone number, Social Security number, dates (birth, admission, discharge),medical record numbers, mental and physical health history, drug use history, results from mental and physical health screening, anddata from experimental measures. All data will be coded by participant number only and any personal identifiers linking participants totheir reports on questionnaires will be detached and destroyed as soon as participation is completed or disqualification occurs. 2. fMRI procedure: fMRI is a non-invasive procedure that is widely used and safe. Potential risks such as static magnetic field, radio-frequency field, magnetic field gradients, and acoustic noise are rarely dangerous or life-threatening. The risks of the study areextremely small when exclusion criteria are observed and are outweighed by the large benefits of these studies to clinical andneuroscience research. Subjects will be asked questions about claustrophobia and the presence of metal in their body to make surethat the MRI scan is safe. If they have implanted metal of any kind, they will not be scanned. For their safety, they will be asked toremove any metal in their clothing before the scan (for example, belts and rings). Subjects will be given noise dampening head phonesto reduce the discomfort due to the noise of the machines. Subjects are asked to report any discomfort immediately. They maydiscontinue the scan at any time if they are too anxious to continue, by communicating with the scanning operator that they would like toend the session. Additional minor or rare risks include: i) discomfort from lying still for 1 hour; ii) fast imaging sequences maypotentially induce peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) that may cause mild discomfort but is not harmful to participants; iii) anxiety orpanic attack caused by close confinement in the scanner; iv) the MRI may reveal a minor or significant lesion in the brain (e.g., tumor)previously unknown to the subject. The CRC nurse and PI and also the Study Physician will be available and/or present during the fMRIscans in order to evaluate the emergence of any anxiety/panic attack, elevated levels of anxiety, or emotional discomfort during theprocedure.3. Insertion of needles/catheters: Some risks are associated with the insertion of intravenous catheters. These include bruising andpain at the site of the needle insertion, and a small risk of infection. A trained CRU nurse will perform blood draws and catheterinsertion to minimize pain and standard sterilization techniques and other routine precautions will be utilized in order to minimize the riskof needle-site infections. 4. Intravenous administration of alcohol: The possible adverse effects of alcohol include pain at the injection site, disorientation, orsedation. Nausea and/or vomiting are extremely unlikely given the moderate dose administered. No serious adverse effects have beenreported in healthy men and women following intravenous administration of a 6% alcohol solution (Blekher et al. 2002; Davidson et al.1997; Ray and Hutchinson 2004; Yoder et al. 2005). We have successfully administered a higher dose (80mg%) than that proposedhere (60mg%) intravenously both in and out of the scanner (Weafer et al. 2018). 5. Pregnancy testing. There is a risk of psychological discomfort from exposure to a pregnancy test or the upset that might result froman unexpected non-negative outcome. These tests do, of course, require the participant's consent and cooperation, and all potentialfemale participants are given advance notice of this test during initial phone contact. The PI's standard operation procedures will callfor the exclusive use of a trained Research Assistant (RA) to give instructions, process the samples, and report the results toparticipants individually. The RA will advise participants of the conclusiveness of negative results and also stress the ambiguity of non-negative outcomes. The RA will explain that rather than repeating non-negative tests to try to rule out a possible false-positive, anySection 9 Page 6 of 1150301
CLOSED
ambiguous result is grounds for disqualification. The assistant will also immediately offer specific advice about where to get moreprecise follow-up testing and provide information about how to get counseling if desired.The risks to subjects are justified by the knowledge to be gained regarding sex-specific behavioral and brain-mediated processesrelated to alcohol use. Knowledge about sex-specific risk factors for alcohol abuse will inform our understanding of the developmentand treatment of drug and alcohol use disorders in men and women. Also, participants in the research derive considerable educationalbenefit from their participation. Subjects are genuinely interested in studies of alcohol and have many questions about how the drugmay affect them. The feedback to participants includes written educational information about blood alcohol levels and the risks ofimpairment likely to result from drinking various amounts of alcohol. Participants in our studies often comment that this information isextremely helpful in judging the safety of their drinking practices and deciding about activities, such as driving after drinking. Given thepotential educational benefits that subjects derive from participating in this research, the minimal risk to subjects in this research isreasonable.Available Alternative Opportunities/TreatmentsDescribe alternative treatments or opportunities that might be available to those who choose not to participate in the study, and whichoffer the subject equal or greater advantages. If applicable, this should include a discussion of the current standard of care treatment(s).There are no alternative treatments.Back to TopRecords, Privacy, and ConfidentialitySpecify where the data and/or specimens will be stored and how the researcher will ensure the privacy and confidentiality of both.Specify who will have access to the data/specimens and why they need access.Describe how data will be managed after the study is complete:If data/specimens will be maintained, specify whether identifiers will be removed from the maintained information/material.If identifiers will not be removed, provide justification for retaining them and describe how you will protect confidentiality.If the data/specimens will be destroyed, verify that this will not violate retention policies and will adhere to applicable facilityrequirements.If this study will use de-identified data from another source, describe what measures will be taken to ensure that subject identifiers arenot given to the investigator.If applicable, describe procedures for sharing data/specimens with collaborators not affiliated with UK.For additional considerations: Return of Research Results or Incidental Research Findings HIPAA policies FERPA policies Procedures for Transfer agreements Information regarding multi-site studies NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy Digital DataAll research materials obtained from participants will be collected directly from them at the time of recruitment and participation. Theresearch material consists of subjects' questionnaire scores, fMRI data (BOLD, CBF), hormonal assays (estradiol, progesterone,testosterone), behavioral performance on the stop signal task, and subjective reports (BAES, DEQ). No archival records or other datawill be used. All data will be coded by participant numbers and any personal identifiers linking participants to their reports onquestionnaires and computer tests will be maintained in a separate location by the PI. The data will then be transferred to computerfiles with all individual identifiers removed. All data will be stored in coded files and locked in the laboratory area. All information will bein the form of numerical data and used for research purposes only. Results will be reported only for groups, and no single individual willbe identified. Personal identifiers, such as names, will be removed from the subjects' data records. Urine samples will be collected atscreening, prior to a subject's participation in the experimental protocol. These urine samples will be tested for the presence of a fullrange of drugs of abuse. Drug urine screens and urine pregnancy tests will also be conducted daily during the experimental protocol.Expired air samples will also be taken at these times to detect the presence of recent alcohol consumption. Other research materialsobtained from the volunteers include demographic information, mental and physical health screening information, experimental data,and non-intrusive staff observations. Experimental data include the stop signal task measures, fMRI BOLD/CBF data, hormonalassays, and self-reported responses on questionnaires.Files will not contain the name of the volunteer. Instead, each volunteer will be assigned a unique identifying number. All writtendocuments will be stored in locked cabinets in the PI's office (Kastle Hall Room 205). All data will be retained for a period of at leastsix years after the end of the IRB approval period. Key access will be limited to immediate laboratory personnel. Electronic informationwill reside on a stand-alone, password-protected computer.To protect or minimize any possible risks, we will follow these procedures:1. Subjects will be carefully screened to exclude those who are physically or psychiatrically at risk.2. The study will be conducted in the MRISC and the CRU (both of which are located in the hospital), where emergency assistance,including the Study Physician (Dr. Lon Hays), is close at hand. Dr. Hays will provide medical consultation for the project and 24 hour on-call support from the Psychiatry Department. All laboratory technicians will have completed the training course on Human SubjectsSection 9 Page 7 of 1150301

Protection and will be CPR and first-aid certified. 3. A technician or nurse is present during all sessions. 4. Subjects agree not to take any drugs for 24 hours before the sessions and compliance is monitored by breathalyzer and urine tests.5. Subjects will remain in the laboratory until their BrACs have fallen below 20mg% (per NIAAA guidelines), and they will be providedwith transportation home if needed.6. Subject files containing confidential information will be maintained in a locked cabinet in the PI's office (Kastle Hall Room 205). Onlypersonnel directly connected with the study have access to this information, and these individuals are instructed in the importance andprocedures for maintaining confidentiality. 7. Data collected in the study are identified by subject codes only, and no data will be published in a form by which the subject can beidentified. 8. MRI Scanning: Necessary precautions for safety for magnetic exposure will be taken and ensured in each subject and each will bescreened for MRI safety with a standard MR Safety form. Any individuals who have potential MRI risks, such as pacemakers, surgicalclips, metallic surgical devices, and/or other irremovable ferrous-containing materials, will be excluded. Minor risk of discomfort due tolying still for 1 hour will be minimized by custom pads and pillows to make the subject as comfortable as possible. Subjects will beconstantly monitored for any side effects and will be treated appropriately by the available physicians and nurses. Earplugs may beused to reduce discomfort due to noise. The study may be aborted if the subject has any discomfort. The safety of the subjects will becontinually monitored. Regarding the potential for PNS, the MRI machine is operated within FDA guidelines so the potential for PNS islow. Discovery and disclosure of incidental finding or abnormality on MRI scans: First, all subjects will be instructed in their formal consentprocess about the potential risks of discovering an incidental finding or abnormality on their MRI scan. Second, if an abnormality isfound in a subject's MRI scan, the Study Physician will contact the subject and refer the patient for medical follow-up for the problem ifthe subject requests, including referral to a primary care doctor. If a subject has a primary care doctor, the Study Physician will contactthe subject's doctor, at the request and with the permission of the subject, to inform him/her of the finding on the MRI scan and to helphim/her to get the subject the appropriate follow-up. The decision as to whether to proceed with further examination or treatment liessolely with the subject and his/her primary care physician.9. Alcohol Infusions: Subjects will be monitored carefully by the nurse and PI during infusions. Infusions and scans will be terminatedand the subject removed from the scanner immediately if they report feeling nauseated. Subjects will fast for the 2 hours beforescanning begins to minimize the possibility of aspiration of stomach contents. Additionally, the subject's head will be restrained only bya conformal pillow while in the scanner; they will be able to lift their heads at any time. Infusion solution will be prepared by theUniversity of Kentucky Hospital Pharmacy Investigational Drug Service to ensure that the concentration of the infusate is not any higherthan 6% alcohol, in order to reduce the risk of pain at the injection site. Infusion solutions will also be warmed using instant heat packs.The calculated pump rate will be close to the maximum rate of the pump and therefore accidental overdose due to the use of higherthan calculated pump rates will be unlikely. Alarmed timers will be used by the nurse and PI to monitor the length of the infusion. Allcalculations will be double checked with the Senior MRI Research Technologist. We will exclude subjects who have not previouslyconsumed alcohol and those who report less than regular moderate to heavy alcohol consumption. 10. A list of counseling and substance abuse treatment referrals will be provided to all participants. This referral will includepsychological services such as The Harris Center at 859-257-6853.11. The study will employ a pre-screening eligibility survey to determine if a volunteer meets basic inclusion/exclusion criteria. We willbuild and administer the eligibility survey on UK’s REDCap which provides HIPAA compliant storage on UK servers and encryptedtransmission of survey responses. The portable devices do not download the data, it is directly stored into the secure web-basedconnection (https) behind the firewall. All files are password protected once entered into the system. All project data is stored andhosted locally.UK IRB policies state that IRB-related research records must be retained for a minimum of 6 years after study closure.

The data and safety monitoring plan for this study follows the NIAAA guidelines for the administration of alcohol. The PI will beresponsible for monitoring the safety and efficacy of the proposed study, executing the DSMP, and complying with the reportingrequirements. The PI will be assisted by Dr. Lon Hays, the Study Physician, in the event that medical consultations are needed. Asummary of the DSM report will be included in the annual progress report to NIAAA. The subjects' sociodemographic characteristics,expected versus actual recruitment rates, summary of AEs and SAEs, and any actions or changes with respect to the protocol will beincluded in this report.Data Monitoring Plan: Subjective and behavioral data will be collected using standardized computerized measures. Brain imaging datawill be identified with the study ID only and sent to a server owned by the PI by the MRISC staff. Hormonal data obtained from bloodsample assays will also be sent to the PI by the analyzing laboratory. All subject data (subjective, behavioral, fMRI, and hormonal) willonly be identified with the subject's ID. The PI will keep the codes that link the name of the participant and the study ID confidential in apassword protected file on a password protected computer. Data from paper forms will be entered in the computer. Data will beanalyzed using the general linear model and regression analyses within SPM and SPSS.Safety Monitoring Plan: We will recruit healthy volunteers aged 21-29 years. Potential volunteers will be screened for physical andpsychiatric health. Women will provide a urine sample for a pregnancy test before each session. Exclusion criteria are any seriousmedical conditions requiring medication, current or past medical condition considered to a be a contraindication for study condition,any current Axis I psychiatric disorder, including substance use disorders, any history of psychosis, less than a high school education,lack of fluency in English, and contraindication for MRI scanning (i.e., claustrophobia, pacemaker, heart valves). Women will beaccepted only if they are not pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant. Subjects will attend an orientation session during which they will sign the consent form and be instructed on the procedures of thestudy. All subjects will be monitored for recent alcohol and drug use prior to each session. Those with positive tests will berescheduled or dropped from the study. All fMRI sessions are conducted in a hospital setting. During the sessions, emergencymedical assistance will be available by paging the Study Physician, the psychiatrist resident on call, or the general emergency numberfor the hospital. Alternately, the subject may be transported to the emergency room. All adverse events (AEs) and unanticipatedproblems occurring during the course of the study will be reported to the IRB by the PI. All AEs will be followed until resolvedsatisfactorily. If deemed necessary by a physician, a subject may be withdrawn from the study. AEs will be evaluated for seriousadverse event (SAE) criteria (defined by the FDA). If an SAE should occur, it will be reported to the IRB, NIAAA, and the FDA. Theinitial report will be followed by a complete SAE report, sent to all three institutions. If a subject from the study or the investigatordiscontinues a subject's participation due to an SAE, the patient will receive follow-up medical care as necessary. Follow-up care willcontinue until the subject no longer requires hospitalization, the condition is stabilized with no future change expected, or the problemis determined to be unrelated to the alcohol administered in the study. The outcome of the SAEs will be reported to NIAAA. The annualprogress report submitted to NIAAA will contain a summary of any SAEs occurring in the previous year.Back to TopFuture Use and Sharing of Material (e.g., Data/Specimens/Information)If the material collected for this study will be used by members of the research team or shared with other researchers for future studies,please address the following:list the biological specimens and/or information that will be keptbriefly describe the types, categories and/or purposes of the future researchdescribe any risks of the additional usedescribe privacy/confidentiality protections that will be put into placedescribe the period of time specimens/information may be useddescribe procedures for sharing specimens/information with secondary researchersdescribe the process for, and limitations to, withdrawal of specimens/dataN/AAre you recruiting or expect to enroll Non-English Speaking Subjects or Subjects from a Foreign Culture?

 Statistical Analysis Plan. Statistical Analysis of Brain Activation: The measures of brain activation during response inhibition (BARI) are activation in frontal ROIs (e.g., DLPFC, IFC, ACC, pre-SMA, SMA, and pre-motor cortex), as measured by BOLD % signal change, examined during response inhibition [StopInh>Go]. We will first check that men and women are matched on demographics and drug and alcohol use, and confirm that the [StopInh>Go] contrast activated the inhibitory network circuitry.   Statistical Analysis of Brain Activation: We will perform regression analyses in SPM12 to assess the degree to which baseline hormone levels predict change in BARI following alcohol compared to saline [StopInh>Go, Saline>Alcohol]. We hypothesize that greater baseline E2 will predict less activation following alcohol compared to saline. We will conduct a between-subjects t test to compare men and women on the StopInh>Go, Saline>Alcohol contrast. We hypothesize that alcohol effects on BARI will be greater in women compared to men. Finally, we will calculate change scores (alcohol minus baseline) for hormone levels, and perform regression analyses to predict [StopInh>Go, Saline>Alcohol] from change in hormone levels. We hypothesize that greater alcohol-induced increase in E2 will predict greater decrease in activation following alcohol.

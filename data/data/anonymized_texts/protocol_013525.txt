2. SYNOPSIS  
Name of Sponsor/Company:  Alkermes, Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product: ALKS 3831  
Name of Active Ingredient: Olanzapine and samidorphan  
Title of S tudy:  A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate Weight Gain of ALKS 3831 Compared to Olanzapine in 
Adults with Schizophrenia  
Investigators:  This is a multicenter study . 
Study Period:   
Estimated date of first subject’s consent: Q1 2016 
Estimated date of last subject’s last visit: Q1 2018  Phase of Development: 3 
Objectives:   
Primary:  To evaluate weight gain of ALKS 3831 (a fixed-dose combination of olanzapine and 
samidorphan) compared to olanzapine in adults with schizophrenia  
Secondary: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALKS  3831 in adults with schizophrenia  
Methodology: This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, study in adults with 
schizophrenia.  
Subjects will be screened at Visit 1, up to 30 days prior to randomization. At Visit 2, eligible subjects 
will be randomized 1:1 to ALKS  3831 (olanzapine/10 mg samidorphan) or olanzapine treatment groups 
and receive study drug for up to 24 weeks. Subjects are not excluded from the study if they are taking 
other antipsychotic medication. However they must be tapered off this medication and switched onto 
ALKS 3831 or olanzapine by the end of Week 2, Visit 4. This is an outpatient study in which subjects 
will visit the study site weekly for the first 6 weeks, then biweekly for the remaining 18 weeks. Study 
drug will be provided as coated bilayer tablets dispensed to the subjects in blister packs at each visit to 
be taken at home, one tablet by mouth each day, preferably at bedtime. For the first week, subjects will 
receive 10 mg olanzapine per dose: either ALKS  3831 10/10 (10 mg olanzapine/10 mg samidorphan) 
or OLZ 10 (10 mg olanzapine), according to treatment assignment. At the end of Week 1, the dose will escalate to 20 mg: ALKS  3831 20/10 (20 mg  olanzapine/10 mg  samidorphan) or OLZ 20. Following 
this increase, the dose may be decreased back to 10 mg at the end of Week 2, 3, or 4 according to 
investigator discretion. No further dose adjustments will be allowed beyond Week 4 and the dose will remain fixed for the remaining 20 weeks of the study. Body weight and metabolic parameters 
(including fasting triglycerides, choles terol, and glucose) will be measured throughout the 24- week 
treatment period. Psychiatric symptoms will also be evaluated using PANSS and CGI . A schematic 
summarizing study design is presented below.

• Clinical Global Impression – Improvement (CGI -I) 
Other A ssessments:  
• Cigarette Use Questionnaire 
• Impact of Weight on Quality of Life – Lite Questionnaire (IWQOL -Lite)  
• EuroQol- 5D (EQ- 5D) 
• Substudy : an exploratory substudy will measure body composition (using Bioelectrical 
Impedance Analysis [BIA]) in subjects at a subset of sites participating in the main 
ALK3831-A303 study ; see Addendum A for substudy details  
Safety:  The following assessments will be collected to measure safety and tolerability  throughout the 
study: 
• Adverse events (AEs)  
• Waist Circumference 
• Clinical laboratory parameters including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis 
• Vital signs (oral temperature, respiratory rate, orthostatic blood pressure, and heart rate)  
• Electrocardiogram parameters (Uncorrected QT, QTcF, QTcB, PR, RR, and QRS 
intervals)  
• Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
• Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) 
• Simpson- Angus Scale (SAS)  
• Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)  
Pharmacokinetics/P harmacodynamics:  Concentrations of olanzapine, samidorphan, and metabolit es 
of interest  will be determined from plasma samples collected according to the schedule in Table  3. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data from these samples may b e included in a subsequent population PK 
analysis or other post -hoc analyses conducted outside of this study. 
Statistical Methods:  
Study Populations:  
Safety Population : The safety population includes all randomized subjects who receive at least one 
dose of study drug (ALKS 3831 or olanzapine). 
Efficacy Population : The efficacy population includes: 
• Full analysis set (FAS)  population:  all subjects in the safety population who have at least 
one postbaseline weight assessment  
• Early weight gain population : all subjects in the FAS population who gain weight (>0 kg) 
at Week 1  
Efficacy:  
Primary Endpoint s: The primary endpoints are : 
• Percent change from baseline in body weight at Week 24  in the FAS population  
Page 5 of 111
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
• Proportion of subjects with ≥10% weight gain at Week 24 in  the FAS population 
For percent change from baseline in body weight at Week 24, the primary  analysis will be carried out 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA ) method based on multiple  imputation for missing data. 
The model will include treatment group, race, and baseline age as factor s, and baseline weight as a 
covariate. 
For proportion of subjects with ≥10% weight gain at Week 24, the primary analyses will be carried out 
using a logistic regression model based on multiple  imputation for missing data. The model will 
include treatment group, race, and  baseline age as factors,  and baseline weight as a covariate.  
Key S econdary Endpoint : The key secondary endpoint is : 
• Proportion of subjects with ≥7% weight gain at Week 24 
The key secondary endpoint will be analyzed similarly to  the primary endpoints. 
A fixed sequence approach will be used to control overall Type I error rate. First, both primary 
endpoints will be tested at an alpha level of 0.05. If both primary endpoints are statistically significant, the key secondary endpoint will be tested at an alpha level of 0.05.  
Other Endpoints : Other endpoint s are: 
• Percent change from baseline in body weight at Week 24 in the early weight gain 
population 
• Proportion of subjects with ≥10% weight gain at Week 24 in  the early weight gain 
population 
• Change from baseline in fasting lipids (fasting triglycerides, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol),  
fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HbA1c by visit 
• Absolute change in body weight by visit 
• Change from baseline in waist circumference by visit  
• Change from baseline in PANSS total score and subscales by visit 
• Change from baseline in CGI- S by visit  
• CGI-I score by visit  
• Change from baseline in IWQOL -Lite total score and subscales by visit  
• Change from baseline in EQ- 5D score by visit  
Safety: All safety analyses will be based on observed data only, and no missing values will be 
imputed. Reported adverse event terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) and summarized by preferred term and system organ class categories.  
Observed values and change from baseline in BMI, waist circumference, laboratory parameters, vital 
signs, and ECG parameters will be summarized by treatment group and study v isit. 
Prior and concomitant medication use will be summarized by World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Anatomical Therapeutic Class code and treatment group.  
Pharmacokinetics/ Pharmacodynamics: Concentrations of olanzapine, samidorphan, and metabolites 
of interest  will be provided as by -subject listings.

Sample Size Considerations:  The target sample size is 400 randomized subjects (200 per treatment 
group). This sample size will provide at least 90% power to detect a significant difference in mean 
percent change in body weight at Week 24 of 4 % or more (3% on ALKS 3831 vs 7% on olanzapine 
group with standard deviation of 9%) and a 13% difference in proportion of subjects with ≥10% weight 
gain at Week 24 (1 4% on ALKS 3831 vs 27% on  olanzapine group). 
One unblinded interim analysis will be conducted by an independent statistical center (ISC) when 50% of subjects (N=200) have completed the double-blind treatment period or have discontinued from the 
study to determine if the final sample size will be increased to 540 (270 subjects per treatment group).  
Interim Analysis:  The details regarding the conduct of unblinded interim analyses will be specified in 
the interim  analysis operational plan and the statistical testing methodology will be  specified in the 
interim analysis plan (IAP). There will be no early stopping for efficacy or futility. The sponsor w ill 
not be informed with any unblinded interim analysis results except fo r a recommendation to either 
increase the sample size or to leave the sample size unchanged.

5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background  
Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe disease with debilitating psychotic symptoms, physical and 
psychiatric comorbidities and increased mortality. Despite the availability of a range of 
FDA -approved medicines, the disease is still inadequately treated and associated with enormous 
human and economic cost. Life expectancy is reduced by 19  years in men and 16 years in 
women with schizophrenia compared to the general population ( Harris and Barraclough 1998; 
Lambert et al, 2010 ; Tiihonen et al, 2009) . The decreased life expectancy is due to a combination 
of direct effects of the disease, eg increased rates of suicide and violence ( Hodgins 2008; Kuo et 
al, 2005) , as well as indirect causes including increased incidence of obesity and cardiovascular 
disease (Nasrallah et al, 2006 ; Saha et al, 2007). 
The goal of treatment in schizophrenia is to achieve the maximal reduction in positive and negative symptoms and increase functionality. Unfortunately, even with regular administration of currently available antipsychotic medications at full therapeut ic dose levels, the overwhelming 
majority of patients continue to exhibit residual active symptomatology. For physicians and patients, in many cases the current treatment paradigm involves an efficacy/tolerability trade -off, 
where use of the most efficacio us agents is avoided or delayed in order to avoid known safety 
issues. As such, there is a need for more efficacious therapies with better tolerability. 
Olanzapine is regarded as one of the most effective antipsychotic agents with well -recognized 
efficacy and decreased incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms. However, its efficacy is 
compromised by safety and tolerability limitations that affect compliance and retention of 
patients on olanzapine therapy ( Lieberman et al, 2005 ). In particular, results of the Clinical 
Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE), identify olanzapine as an effective 
atypical antipsychotic associated with the highest weight gain (9.4 kg over a treatment period up 
to 18 months and ≥7% body weight in 30% of subjects) and a comparatively higher discontinuation rate compared to other antipsychotic agents due to weight gain and metabolic 
effects. As a result of these limitations surrounding safety, tolerability, adherence and retention, 
the risk of olanzapine therapy can outweigh the benefit and patients are often switched to alternative antipsychotic agents even if they are less effective.  
ALKS 3831 is a fixed-dose combination product of olanzapine and samidorphan ( also referred to  
as ALKS 33 or RDC-0313, see Section  5.2.1 for more information on samidorphan) under 
investigation for the treatment of schizophrenia. Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies demonstrated that 
coadministration of samidorphan with olanzapine attenuates  the weight gain experienced with 
olanzapine alone. Results from these studies are described in more detail in Section  5.3. In 
addition, ALKS 3831 may have the further benefit of controlling substance abuse in patients with schizophrenia. Comorbid substance use disorder is a well- recognized obstacle to patient 
care. A n estimated 1 out of every 3 patients with schizophrenia (33.7%) meet or have m et criteria 
for alcohol use disorder ( Regier et al, 1990). Patients with both schizophrenia and alcohol use 
disorder represent a common variant of the schizophrenia spectrum that is difficult to treat and is 
associated with an extremely poor prognosis ( Dixon 1999; Koekkoek et al, 2006) . In clinical 
studies, samidorphan has been shown to block both the subjective and physiological effects of 
Page 15 of 111
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
the opioid agonist remifentanil ( ALK33 -004) and it is correlated with reduced drinking behavior 
in adults with alcohol dependence ( ALK33 -005). ALK3831-401 is an ongoing clinical study 
designed to evaluate the effect of ALKS 3831 on drinking behavior in adult subje cts with 
schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder. 
In summary, ALKS 3831 is being explored as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of 
schizophrenia designed to combine the antipsychotic efficacy of olanzapine with a reduced risk 
of weight gain and associated metabolic deficits. Development of ALKS 3831 as a fixed-dose combination of olanzapine and samidorphan has the potential to improve upon the benefit/risk 
profile of olanzapine alone and address a significant clinical need for patients that are currently 
forced to choose between treatment efficacy vs safety.  
5.2. Study Drugs  
In this study a fixed dose combination of olanzapine and samidorphan will be administered in a 
single bilayer tablet. The following sections provide an overview of samidorphan and 
olanzapine. Detailed information about the study drugs can be found in the current ALKS 3831 Investigator’s Brochure  (IB).  
5.2.1. Samidorphan 
Samidorphan is a new molecular entity in clinical development by Alkermes . It is an opioid 
modulator that functions as an antagonist at μ-opioid receptors and as a low intrinsic activity agonist at κ - and δ-opioid receptors. It is currently being investigated in combination with 
buprenorphine for the treatment of major depressive disorder (ALKS 5461) and in combination with olanzapine for the treatment of schizophrenia. Based on its chemical structure, samidorphan is considered a Schedule II controlled substance according to the US Drug Enforcement Agency 
and will require proper handling (see Section  10.5 ). At least ten clinical studies of samidorphan 
have been conducted to date, 8 of which included subjects that received samidorphan alone (not 
in combination with another product). Commonly reported adverse events (AEs) observed across 
all studies included nausea, fatigue, and somnolence. Overall, no trends or clinically meaningful 
changes have been observed in clinical laboratory analytes, vital sign parameters, or electrocardiogram (ECG) data.  
5.2.2. Olanzapine  
Olanzapine has been available in the US since 1996 (Zyprexa
®) and was originally approved for 
the treatment of schizophrenia, but has since been approved for other indications including the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents and bipolar disorder. The safety and tolerability profile 
of olanzapine is well documented, and adverse event labeling is supported by an extensive safety database that includes over 8,500 adult patients ( Eli Lilly and Company 2016). Commonly 
reported AEs consistent across all or most dosage forms in short- term, placebo controlled trials 
include somnolence, constipation, dry mouth, accidental injury, weight gain, postural hypotension, dizziness, asthenia, fever, and abnormal gait.  
5.3. Study Rationale  
The rationale for this Phase 3 study is based on the promising efficacy and safety results from prior Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of ALKS 3831.

A Phase 1 study conducted in healthy males ( Study ALK33 -301), demonstrated that 3  weeks of 
treatment with ALKS  3831 resulted in 29% less weight gain compared with subjects who 
received olanzapine alone. Based on the results of this study, a two- part (Part  A and Part  B), 
Phase 2 study ( ALK3831-302) was con ducted to evaluate the antipsychotic efficacy and body 
weight effect of ALKS  3831 in subjects with schizophrenia. In Part A (a 12 -week, double-blind, 
randomized, olanzapine-controlled phase), ALKS 3831 demonstrated similar antipsychotic 
efficacy compared w ith olanzapine based on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 
total score. ALKS  3831 also led to clinically and statistically significant less body weight gain 
compared to olanzapine. Specifically, treatment with ALKS 3831 led to a 37% lower mean percent weight gain from baseline compared with olanzapine, and a 2.7-fold reduction in the risk of gaining 10% or more of baseline body weight in the full study population. Moreover, in the 
population of subjects (63% of total) that gained weight during the 1- week olanzapine lead -in 
period (referred to as the early weight gain population), ALKS 3831 treatment led to a 51% 
lower mean percent weight gain compared with olanzapine, and a 4.1-fold reduction in the risk 
of gaining 10% or more of baseline body weig ht. Data from Part  B (a 12 -week all -active, 
extension) indicated maintenance of the beneficial effect on weight observed in Part  A, while 
maintaining stable PANSS scores over the 12 week extension period. 
The current Phase 3 study will further evaluate weight gain of ALKS 3831 compared to 
olanzapine in adults with schizophrenia over a 24 week period. 
5.4. Dose Rationale  
The selected doses of ALKS  3831 (20/10 [20 mg olanzapine/10 mg samidorphan] and 10/10 
[10 mg olanzapine/10 mg samidorphan] ) are within the ap proved olanzapine therapeutic dose 
range for the treatment of schizophrenia ( Eli Lilly and Company 2016 ). Olanzapine doses of 
10 and 20 mg will bracket the lowest and highest approved maintenance doses for the treatment 
of schizophrenia and provide adequate coverage for the intended commercial maintenance dose 
range of ALKS  3831, 10 to 20 mg. 
The 10 mg samidorphan dose was identified as the minimally effective dose based on the robust 
efficacy, with optimal safety profile observe d in ALK3831-302 at this dose. A fixed dose of 
samidorphan was selected due to the fact that data from this study demonstrated no correlation 
between the ratio of samidorphan/olanzapine dose and percent change from baseline in body 
weight, indicating that even with higher olanzapine doses, a fixed dose of samidorphan is 
sufficient to achieve maximal effect on reducing olanzapine-induced weight gain.

worker, or designee responsible for the conduct of the study) or is immediate family1 of 
an Alkermes, CRO, or study site employee  
7.3. Subject Withdrawal  
A subject may be discontinued from the study at any time if the subject, investigator, or sponsor determines that it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue participation. If a subject 
has an ANC <1.0 × 10
3 µL or HbA1c ≥6.5% at any time from Visit 2 to Visit 17, the PI (or 
designee) should discontinue the subject from participation immediately. Other reasons for 
discontinuation include:  
• Adverse Event  
• Lack of Efficacy  
• Lost to Follow-up 
• Withdrawal by Subject  
• Protocol Deviation (non-compliance with study drug or study procedures) 
• Pregnancy  
• Study Terminated by Sponsor 
• Other  
Following premature discontinuation, subjects can be started on another antipsychotic at the 
discretion of their prescribing physician. 
If a subject withdraws from the study for any reason , they will be asked to return to the clinic for 
an early termination  (ET)  visit. The early termination visit should be scheduled as close as 
possible to the subject’s last dose and will mimic the assessments scheduled to be conducted at 
the EOT visit (Visit 17).  Randomized subjects who discontinue study drug but are willing to 
come in for further assessments will be asked to complete the ET visit followed by 2 safety 
follow-up visits 2 and 4 weeks after t he ET visit (same assessments as Visits 18 and 19 in 
Table 3. They will then be asked to return to the study center for monthly visits until end of 
planned treatment, to collect the following information: weight, adverse events, and new 
antipsychotics. 
Any ongoing AEs  at the time of discontinuation  will be followed until resolution, until deemed 
stable by the investigator , or until the subject is deemed by the investigator to be lost to 
follow-up. If, in the opinion of the investigator, it is necessary to monitor a subject beyond the safety 
follow-up visit, the follow-up period may be extended as necessary. In such instances, the 
sponsor and the investigator will agree to an acceptable follow-up schedule.

In the event that a subject chooses to withdraw from the study, the investigator should make a 
reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s) for withdrawal, while fully respecting the subject’s 
rights.  
If the subject fails or refuses to return to the study center, an attempt must be made to contact the 
subject by telephone in order to assess as many safety and efficacy parameters as possible. All 
data collected over the telep hone must be documented and kept in the subject’s record. 
The investigator must maintain a record of all subjects who fail to complete the study. A full 
explanation of the reason for study discontinuation will be documented and made on the 
appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF). In addition, the eCRF will also record if weight 
gain contributed to premature discontinuation from the study. If a subject is lost to follow-up, a reasonable attempt to contact the subject must be made and documented.  
Randomized subjects completing all scheduled visits through Visit 17 will be considered study completers.  
7.4. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects prematurely discontinued from the study post-randomization will not be replaced.

8. STUDY DESIGN 
8.1. Overall Study Design and Pla n 
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, study in adults with schizophrenia. 
Subjects will be screened at Visit 1, up to 30 days prior to randomization. Eligible subjects will 
be randomized at Visit 2 in a 1:1 fashion to the following 2 treatment groups: ALKS  3831 
(olanzapine/10 mg samidorphan) or olanzapine. For all subjects, the initial olanzapine dose will be 10 mg given as either ALKS 3831 10/10 (10 mg olanzapine/10 mg samidorphan) or OLZ 10 (10 mg olanzapine), according to treatment assignment. Subjects will be titrated up to 20 mg 
(ALKS  3831 20/10 [20 mg  olanzapine/10 mg  samidorphan] or OLZ 20 [20 mg olanzapine]) at 
the end of Week 1 of treatment. Following this dose increase, the dose may be decreased to ALKS 3831 10/10 or OLZ 10 at the end of Week 2, 3, or 4 if there are tolerability issues based 
on the judgment of the investigator. Reasons for down- titration will be documented in the 
electronic case report form (eCRF). No further dose adjustments will be allowed beyond week 4 
and the dose will remain fixed for the remaining 20 weeks of the study.  
This is an outpatient study. Subjects will be seen weekly for the first 6 weeks (Visits 3 -8), then 
biweekly for the remaining 18 weeks (Visits 9 -17/end of treatment [EOT]). Body weight and 
metabolic parameters (including fasting triglycerides, cholesterol, and glucose) will be measured 
throughout the 24-week treatment period. Psychiatric symptoms will also be evaluated using the 
assessments listed in Section  11. A schematic summarizing study design is presented in  Figure  1. 
The details of study visits and assessments are provided in Table 3. 
Figure  1: ALK3831- A303 Study Design Schematic  
 
Subjects completing this study will be eligible to enroll in a long -term safety study 
(ALK3831-A304). Subjects not continuing in the long- term safety study or subjects prematurely 
discontinuing from the study will enter the 4 -week safety follow -up period. 
Subjects taking antipsychotic medication  at study entry must be tapered off their medication and 
titrated onto ALKS 3831 or olanzapine (in accordance with the randomized allocation) within 
2 weeks after randomization (by Visit 4). This cross- taper from prior antipsychotic treatment to ALKS 3831

8.2. Schedule of Visits and Assessments  
The schedule of assessments is shown in Table 3. 
For a missed visit, the site should attempt to con tact the subject  to reschedule.  
Premature discontinuation procedures are provided in Section  7.3. Any subject that prematurely 
discontinues study drug but agrees to return for further assessments must first complete an ET 
visit (same assessments as Visit 17) and two safety follow -up visits 2 and 4 weeks following the 
ET visit (same assessments as Visits 18 and 19 respectively). Following completion of these 
follow-up visits, subjects will be asked to return to the study center for monthly visits until the 
end of planned treatment, to collect the following information: weight, adverse events, and  new 
antipsychotics.

8.3. Study Procedures Descriptions  
Details of the study procedures are described below. The overall schedule of assessments is 
provided in Table 3. 
8.3.1. Informed Consent  
The nature of the study and its risks and benefits will be explained to the subject by the principal 
investigator or designated study personnel as outlined in Section  17.3. 
Prior to the administration of any study -specific procedures, authorized study personnel will 
obtain written informed consent from each potential subject . 
8.3.2. Eligibility Review  
An eligibility review will be conducted by the investigator at the visits specified in Table 3 using 
the subject inclusion cri teria in Section 7.1 and  exclusion criteria in Section 7.2. 
8.3.3. Demographics and Medical History  
Subject’s demographic data and medical history will be reviewed and documented at the timepoints specified in Table 3. 
8.3.4. Concomitant Medication Review  
All medications (prescription and non-prescription, including vitamins and herbal supplements) 
taken by a given subject within 60 days of screening through follow-up will be recorded. 
At each study visit (see Table 3),  the investigator or designee will record the following data on 
all medications used by the su bject:  name, dose, regimen, route of administration, start and stop 
dates, and the indication for use. Note: for subjects prematurely discontinuing study drug and 
returning for weight assessments for additional follow-up visits 20 to 24, only  new antipsychotic 
medications will be recorded.  
8.3.5. Vital Signs  
Vital signs (ie, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral body temperature) will be 
assessed at the timepoints specified in Table 3. An effort will be made to consistently use the 
same arm (preferably the subject’s dominant arm) to measure blood pressure and heart rate 
throughout the study. The blood pressure cuff will be calibrated per study site standard operating 
procedures (SOP). Automated measurement is preferred, but if performed manually, heart rate will be measured in the brachial artery for at least 30 seconds. Orthostatic blood pressure and 
heart rate will be collected in the following manner: 
• Allow subject to be in a supine position for at least 5 minutes 
• Measure blood pressure and heart rate 
• Have subject stand for 2 minutes 
• Measure blood pressure and heart rate 
Vital signs may be collected at any time during a scheduled visit, unless otherwise noted.

  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
8.3.6. Physical Examination 
A physical examination will be performed at the timepoints specified in Table  3. A full physical 
will be performe d at screening and a brief physical at subsequent visits. 
8.3.7. Height, Body Weight, and Waist Circumference 
Height will be measured at screening only and body weight and waist circumference will be 
measured at all the timepoints specified in Table 3 . Subjects who discontinue prematurely will be 
asked to return to the clinic for weight measurements as outlined in Section  7.3 and Table 3. 
For weight measurements, subjects should be asked to void immediatel y prior to measurement 
and should be dressed in a hospital gown with consistent under- attire for each measurement. 
Subjects should remove all personal items such as watches and jewelry and they should be 
weighed on the same scale for each measurement under  the same conditions.  
Both weight and waist circumference will be measured three consecutive times at each 
assessment and all measurements will be recorded in the eCRF.  
8.3.8. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be conducted at the timepoints specified in Table 3. All 
scheduled ECGs must be performed after the subject has r ested quietly for at least 5 minutes in 
the supine position. 
A qualified clinician will conduct ECGs and assess ECG results using equipment that has been 
calibrated according to the site’s standard operating procedures. The following ECG parameters will be  collected: pulse, RR, PR, QRS, QT, QT interval corrected using the Fridericia formula 
(QTcF), and QT interval corrected using the Bazett formula (QTcB). 
The ECGs will also be evaluated by a central reader.  
8.3.9. Structured Interviews and Questionnaires  
Brief descriptions of each of the interviews and questionnaires to be distributed are available 
below. All interviews and questionnaires will be administered by trained and qualified study 
personnel. 
Table 3 provides information on the timepoints at which each assessment should be 
administered.  
At screening the medical and psychiatric history and MINI diagnostic interview must be 
conducted prior to the PANSS. For all other visits where assessments overlap, the PANSS should 
be administered first before any other psychiatric assessment.  
8.3.9.1. Diagnostic Assessments  
8.3.9.1.1. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview  
The MINI is a short, clinician -administered, structured diagnostic interview, with an 
administration time of approximately 15 minutes (Sheehan et al, 1998). The MINI has been 
validated against the much longer Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Diagnoses (SCID). The 
MINI will be used at  screening only as indicated in Table 3. 
Page 32 of 111
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
8.3.9.2. Antipsychotic Efficacy Assessments  
For assessments performed at multiple visits, every effort should be made to pair the same 
clinician/rater with the same  subject across visits.  
8.3.9.2.1. Clinical Global Impression -Severity  
The PI or designee will complete the CGI -Severity (CGI -S, Appendix B ) scale at the timepoints 
specified in Table 3. The CGI -S measures mental illness severity. Clinicians are asked to rate 
subjects based on their prior experience working with individuals in a similar patient population 
(Guy 1976). 
8.3.9.2.2. Clinical Global Impression -Improvement  
The PI or designee will complete the CGI -Improvement (CGI- I, Appendix B ) at the timepoints 
specified in Table 3. The CGI -I measures improvement from the first assessment ( Guy 1976). 
8.3.9.2.3. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
The PI or designee will complete the PANSS ( Appendix C ) (Kay et al, 1987) according to the 
schedule in Table 3. The Structured Clinical Interview for the PANSS (SCI -PANSS) will be 
used to administer the PANSS.  
8.3.9.3. Safety Assessments 
8.3.9.3.1. Abnormal Movement Rating Scales  
The PI or designee will complete the following abnormal movement rating scales: The Abnormal 
Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS, Appendix D ) (Guy 1976) , the Barnes Akathisia Rating 
Scale (BARS, Appendix E ) (Barnes 1989 ), and the Simpson- Angus Scale (SAS, Appendix F ) 
(Simpson and Angus 1970) at the timepoints specified in Table 3. 
After administration of the first dose of study drug, if a subject complains of extrapyramidal symptoms on a day when abnormal movement scale assessments are not scheduled, an 
unscheduled abnormal movement assessment should be performed. 
8.3.9.3.2. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The PI or designee will adm inister the C -SSRS ( Appendix G ) according to the schedule in 
Table 3. The “Baseline/Screening” version is to be completed at Visit 1 and the “Since Last  
Visit” version is to be completed at all subsequent scheduled timepoints. The C -SSRS should be 
administered by a qualified clinician trained in assessing and managing suicidal ideation and 
behavior ( Posner et al, 2011). 
8.3.9.4. Other A ssessments  
8.3.9.4.1. Cigarette Use Questionnaire 
Data on cigarette use will be collected using the question: “How many packs of cigarettes did you smoke over the past 7 days?” at the timepoints specified in Table 3. 
Page 33 of 111
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
8.3.9.4.2. Impact of Weight on Quality of Life – Lite  
Subjects will complete the IWQOL -Lite questionnaire ( Appendix H ) at the timepoints specified 
in Table 3. 
8.3.9.4.3. EuroQol-5D 
Subjects will complete the EQ -5D (Appendix I ) at the timepoints specified in Table 3. This scale 
provides an indication of health status based on self- rating in the following five categories: 
mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Additionally, it asks 
subjects to rank their health status on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from “worst imaginable 
health state” to “best imaginable health state.”  
8.3.10. Rater Review  
Rater (ie, study staff) accuracy at screening on pre -specified study measures (ie, PANSS) will be 
reviewed by central raters.  
Later reviews will take place according to a pre -specified schedule (subject to change based on 
rater accuracy) after the measure has been administered using an audio recording of the 
screening interview. Rater review is necessary for mitigating inaccurate inclusion /exclusion 
assessments and inaccurate efficacy assessments.  
Rater assessments require subject interviews to be audio recorded. The audio recording will be disclosed and explained to the subject by study staff and will be disclosed in the ICF during the 
informed consent process. No subject will be recorded without the knowledge that a recording is being made.  
8.3.11. Laboratory Assessments 
8.3.11.1. Drug Testing  
A drug screen for opioids (including codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone) and drugs of abuse (including amphetamine/ methamphetamine, phencyclidine, and cocaine) will be performed at the timepoints specified in 
Table 3. Urine drug screens may be repeated based on investigator judgment. The test may also 
be repeated at any time during the study, should the investigator feel it is warranted.  Subjects are 
not eligible for participation if the results are positive at screening. If a subject is determined to be using any of these substances during the treatment period, the investigator should contact the 
medical monitor to discuss the course of action.  
8.3.11.2. Hematology, Biochemistry, and Urinalysis 
Fasting blood and urine samples will be collected at the timepoints specified in  Table 3 for 
specific hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis assessments listed in  Table 4. Subjects will be 
instructed not to eat or drink anything (except water) for 8 hours before each visit where blood samples for biochemistry and hematology assessments will be collected. Samples will be 
collected in accordance with the site’s standard procedures and analyzed by a central laboratory. 
Laboratory assessments may be repeated at the investigator’s discretion.

A urine/serum pregnancy test will be administered to all women at the timepoints specified in 
Table 3. At the screening visit, results must be negative for the subject to be eligible for the study. As highlighted in Section  7.3 a positive pregnancy test result at any time will necessitate 
the subject’s immediate withdrawal from the study. Additional follow -up may be necessary as 
indicated in Section  8.4.1 
Page 35 of 111

Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
8.3.11.4. Serology Testing 
A blood sample for a serology panel testing for hepatitis B surface antigen, anti -hepatitis  C 
antibodies, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will be performed at screening only 
(Table 3). A positive hepatitis C antibody test must be confirmed by RNA testing to be 
exclusionary.  
8.3.12. Pharmacokin etic Assessments  
Concentrations of olanzapine, samidorphan, and metabolites of interest will be determined from 
plasma samples collected according to the schedule in Table 3. The time of last study drug 
administration (when applicable) and the time of each PK blood draw must be documented in the 
subject’s source documents. Samples for PK analysis will be stored at -20°C ±10°C. The PK data 
from these samp les may be included in a subsequent population PK analysis or other post-hoc 
analyses conducted outside of this study. 
8.3.13. Genotype Sampling  
A blood sample may be collected (at the timepoint indicated in Table 3) for evaluation of 
genotypes that are potentially related to response and to explore potential genetic associations 
with efficacy, adverse effects, symptoms , or outcomes. No other tests will be performed with 
these samples.  
8.3.14. Randomization 
At the timepoint specified in Table 3, subjects will be randomized as outlined in Section  9.3. 
8.3.15. Drug Dispensation and Reconciliation 
Section  9 provides information related to drug dispensing procedures. Study dru g will be 
dispensed at the timepoints specified in Table 3. The study drug use and storage information will 
be explained to/reviewed with the subject.  
Whether or not samidorphan is classified as a controlled substance varies from country to country; some countries have classified samidorphan as a controlled substance, while others have 
not. Sites will be given storage, handling, and reconciliation instructions applicable to their 
country to ensure compliance with local regulations for controlled substances. 
8.3.16. Emergency Treatment Card  
An emergency treatment card will be distributed to each subject and collected from each subject 
at the timepoints indicated in Table 3. The card will indicate that the subject may be receiving an 
opioid antagonist and/or olanzapine and will include the PI’s contact information, a suggested 
pain management plan and information regarding opiate blockade. Subjects will be instructed to 
keep the card with them at all times. Study personnel will confirm that subjec ts have the card in 
their possession at each study visit as indicated in Table 3.

  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
8.3.17. Adverse Event Monitoring  
Adverse events will be monitored continuously from the time a subject signs the informed 
consent document until the completion of the final study visit (see Table 3 ). Adverse events and 
serious adverse events (SAEs) are defined in Section  13.1 and 13.2, respectively. Section  13.4 
provides guidance on the monitoring and recording requirements for AEs. Section  13.5 pro vides 
guidance on the reporting requirements for SAEs. 
8.4. Study Requirements and Restrictions  
8.4.1. Contraception and Pregnancy  
All male and female subjects must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception for the 
duration of the study unless they are surgic ally sterile or post-menopausal (see below). The 
following are considered acceptable methods of contraception:  
1. Double-barrier protection (eg, a condom with spermicide or a diaphragm with spermicide)  
2. Intrauterine device (IUD)  
3. Oral contraceptive pills and other hormonal methods (eg, a vaginal ring, contraceptive patch, contraceptive implant) 
Subjects who are abstinent are eligible, provided they agree to use an acceptable contraceptive 
method should they become sexually active. 
Subjects who are surgically sterile are exempt from the requirement to use contraception. 
Women who have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy are considered surgically sterile. Men who have undergone a vasectomy 
are considered surgically sterile. Partner vasectomy is not considered an approved acceptable method of contraception for a female subject.  
Women who are postmenopausal are also exempt from the requirement to use contraception. For 
the purpose of this study, postmenopausal is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation for at least 12 months prior to screening in women who are 45 years of age or older. 
If a subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study, she will be discontinued from 
study drug immediately. Preg nancies in female subjects and female partners of male subjects 
should be handled in the same manner. The investigator must fill out a Pregnancy Report Form 
and submit the information to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy, 
irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred. The early termination and safety follow-up visits will be scheduled. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion 
or until pregnancy termination and notify the outcome to the sponsor. If the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE the investigator should follow the procedure of reporting SAEs (see Section  13.5). Additional follow-up may be 
required.

  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
8.4.2. Prohibited Medications  
The use of any antipsychotic other than study drug is prohibited except when subjects are 
tapering off of current medication (see Section  8.1). Prohibited medications include the 
following: 
• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (eg, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, selegiline, or 
moclobemide) 
• Long -acting formulations of any antipsychotic agent 
• Antipsychotic agents (with the exception of cross-tapering of previous antipsychotic during first 2 -weeks post randomization) 
• Use of antipsychotic sleep aids (eg, Seroquel
®) is prohibited. However, use of 
benzodiazepines to treat some symptoms is permissible (see Section  8.4.3) 
• In general, the use of psychotropic medications other than study drug is prohibited with the exception of the following (these medications should only be administered after all assessments have been  completed for that visit):  
− Beta-blockers (eg, propranolol or pinodolol), antihistamines, and anticholinergics 
may be used for treatment -emergent akathisia  
− Anticholinergics may be used for extrapyramidal symptoms 
• Chantix
® (varenicline) is prohibited. However, nicotine replacem ent therapy 
including nicotine replacement patch and or al nic otine gum is per mitted 
• All prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) agents taken for the purpose of weight reduction 
• Systemic steroids administered by oral, intravenous, or intramuscular route  
• Topiramate (Topamax
®) and combination products containing topiramate; Calcitonin 
(eg, Miacalcin®) 
• Diabetes treatments and hypoglycemic agents including Metformin and Insulin  
• Antidepressants that have been started within 30 days of screening are prohibited. An antidepressant should not be started during a subject’s participation in the study. 
Subjects who have been on a stable dose of an antidepressant for at least 30 days before screening may be allowed to participate in the study if it is anticipated that the 
dose will not change during the subject’s participation in the study 
Medications that are contraindicated with olanzapine use or exhibit drug- interaction potential 
with olanzapine are prohibited. 
Use of moderate to strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (prescription 
medications, OTC medications, or dietary supplements) within 30 days before randomization through follow-up is prohibited. Refer to Appendix A  for a list of CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
inducers. 
The CRO medical monitor should be consulted for any questions about use of any psychotropic 
medications during a subject’s participation in this study.  
Page 38 of 111
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Use of opioid agonists (eg, codeine, oxycodone, tramadol, or morphine) within 14 days before 
screening is prohibited. Use of opioid antagonists, including naltrexone (any formulations) and 
naloxone within 60 days before screening and throughout the study period is prohibited. Note : 
during the study period, opioid agonists should be avoided as they may be rendered ineffective 
by samidorphan. 
8.4.3. Permitted Therapy  
Permissible potential medications to treat extrapyramidal symptoms may include 
benzodiazepines, antihistamines, and anticholinergics. Benzodiazepines should be utilized for treatment -emergent  akathisia. While insomnia may be treated with a variety of agents, short 
half-life benzodiazepines should be utilized to avoid the potential for lingering effects on 
daytime functioning and study assessments (eg, triazolam). Non -benzodiazepine medication may 
be used to treat insomnia (eg, zolpidem, eszopiclone) . Treatment of agitation and/or anxiety with 
benzodiazepines is permissible. However, doses should be restricted to no more than a 2 mg lorazepam equivalent per day and should be kept as stable as possible throughout study so as not to interfere with daytime functioning and study assessments.  
8.4.4. Pain Management 
Because ALKS  3831 contains samidorphan, a μ-opioid receptor antagonist, patients may 
experience reduced or ineffective analgesia when taking an opioid analgesic agent concurrently 
with ALKS  3831, including several days after last dosing of ALKS 3831. 
In the event of an emergency, pain management of the subject should include the following: 
• Regional analgesia or use of non -opioid analgesics 
• If opiate anesthesia or analgesia is required, the subject should be continuously 
monitored, in an anesthesia care setting, by persons not involved in the conduct of the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure. The opioid therapy must be provided by individuals 
specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of the 
respiratory effects of potent opioids, specifically the establishment and the 
maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation  
• Close monitoring by appropriately trained personnel in a setting equipped and staffed 
for cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
For subjects requiring emergency opioid analgesics prior to dosing, the study drug should not be 
administered. If opioid analgesics are required after the study drug has been dosed, it may take several days for opiate sensitivity to be restored, since samidorphan is an opioid antagonist and 
could interfere with opioid- mediated pain management.  
8.4.5. Other Restrictions and Requirements  
Additional restrictions and requirements include: 
• Prohibited substances include amphetamines (including methamphetamine), cocaine, barbiturates, methadone, opioids (including morphine, oxycodone, methadone, and 
buprenorphine), and phencyclidine 
Page 39 of 111
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
• Subjects will be required to abstain from blood or blood product donation during the 
study and for 30 days following the follow-up visit 
• Subjects will be instructed to maintain their normal caffeine intake and/or tobacco use 
as well as no rmal activity/exercise throughout the study. Subjects will be asked to 
abstain from strenuous physical activity for 48 hours prior to each study visit 
• Subjects are prohibited from participating in a weight management program 
(including weight loss surgery) or from entering a smoking cessation program for the 
duration of the study 
Subjects will be asked to refrain from driving, operating machinery, or engaging in hazardous 
activities until they and the investigator are sure the study drug is not impairing their judgment 
and/or ability to perform skilled tasks. 
See Section  8.3.4 for details regarding the concomitant medication review .

9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
9.1. Study Drug Dose and Administration  
Study drugs include: 
• ALKS  3831 10/10 (10 mg  olanzapine/10 mg samidorphan) or 20/10 (20 mg 
olanzapine/10 mg samidorphan) administered as a coated bilayer tablet 
• Olanzapine 10 mg or 20 mg administered as a coated bilayer tablet  
At Visit 2 and all subsequent visits until Vis it 17 ( EOT ), subjects will be given blister cards 
containing study drug to take at home. Subjects will be instructed to take one tablet by mouth 
each day, preferably at bedtime. Dosing may be swit ched to another time at the investigator’s 
discretion if there are tolerability problems; however, frequent switching is discouraged. 
Subjects will be instructed to keep all unused tablets in their blister card and to return unused 
tablets to the study site at their next visit. If dosing is to occur at that visit, the dose should be 
taken from the subject’s next blister card, not from the card they are returning.  
If a dose is missed or forgotten, subjects will be instructed to resume regular dosing the 
following night. Subjects will be instructed not to take a double dose to try to “make up” for the 
missed dose. 
9.2. Study Drug Return and Adherence Review  
Subjects will undergo a study drug adherence review at the timepoints indicated in Table 3. Subjects will be instructed to keep all unused tablets in their original containers and to return the 
original containers with any unused study drug at each visit following dispensation. Study drug accountability will be documented as the number of tablets dispensed, dosed, lost/missing, or 
remaining. If applicable, the site will discuss non -adherence with the subject  
9.3. Randomization/Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatme nt 
Subjects meeting eligibility criteria at baseline (Day 1) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
ALKS 3831 or olanzapine. 
Randomization will be performed centrally through an Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS). A unique randomization number will be as signed by the IWRS once eligibility has been 
determined. Once a randomization number has been assigned, that number must not be used 
again if, for example, a subject is withdrawn from the study. Codes will be prepared by an 
independent biostatistician who is not otherwise involved in this study. 
9.4. Blinding  
All Alkermes staff, clinical staff, and subjects will be blinded to treatment assignment until 
database lock.  
The principal investigator is responsible for all trial- related medical decisions. If the investigator 
deems it necessary to break the study blind in the interest of a subject’s medical safety, he or she must make every effort to contact the CRO/sponsor medical monitor before the blind is broken. 
Page 41 of 111
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
If the site is unable to contact the medical monitor p rior to breaking the blind, the medical 
monitor must be contacted within 24 hours following disclosure of study drug assignment. Any 
premature unblinding should be promptly documented. 
Breaking the blind for a single subject will not affect the blind for t he remaining subjects.

10. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  AND MANAGEMENT  
10.1. Study Drug  
The ALKS 3831 drug product will be supplied as a coated bilayer tablet in two fixed-dose 
combinations: 
• ALKS 3831 10/10 (10 mg olanzapine/10 mg samidorphan) 
• ALKS 3831 20/10 (20 mg olanzapine/10 mg samidorphan) 
Samidorphan is a Schedule II controlled substance. Thus, ALKS 3831 should be treated as a Schedule II controlled substance in the US and any other country in which it is controlled. 
Matching olanzapine-only drug will be manufactured by Alkermes, Inc and will be supplied as a 
coated bilayer tablet in two dose strengths: 
• OLZ 10 (10 mg olanzapine) 
• OLZ 20 (20 mg olanzapine) 
10.2. Packaging and Labeling  
ALKS 3831 and olanzapine will be supplied in blister packs. Blister cards will be in w eekly and 
biweekly configurations. Weekly blister cards will contain 9 tablets, enough for 1 week of dosing 
plus sufficient overage for 2 additional once daily doses. Biweekly blister cards will contain 
16 tablets, enough for 2 weeks of dosing plus sufficient overage for 2 additional once daily doses. 
10.3. Storage  
Product should be stored at not more than 25°C. 
Under the US Controlled Substances Act, samidorphan is considered a Schedule II substance 
because it is derived from opium alkaloids. Therefore, samidorphan and/or blinded study drug must be stored in accordance with restrictions related to Schedule II substances. The site will 
take adequate precautions, including storage of the investigational drug in a securely locked, 
substantially constructed cabinet, or other securely locked, substantially constructed enclosure, access to which is limited, to prevent theft or diversion of the substance. 
10.4. Accountability  
The investigator will be responsible for the oversight of recording the receipt and administration of study drug, and for insuring the supervision of the storage and allocation of these supplies. 
The investigator is required to maintain current drug dispensing and accountability logs 
throughout the study. The investigator may delegate accountability duties to an appropriate and 
qualified pharmacist or staff member who is under the supervision of the investigator. The investigator or designee must allow the Clinical Research Associate or equivalent to perform 
drug reconciliation during each study monitoring visit. All unused supplies will be checked 
against the study drug movement records before investigational drug is returned or destroyed.

Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Refer to Section  8.3.15 for additional study drug reconciliation procedures. 
10.5. Handling and Disposal  
Following completion and verification of accountability logs, all unused and used packages must 
be destroyed. Packages may be destroyed on site according to Good Clinic al Practice (GCP) and 
site practice. Alternatively, the sponsor may arrange for destruction with a third party vendor 
operating in accordance with GCP and/or Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), as applicable.

Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
13. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
The following assessments will be collected to measure safety and tolerability throughout the 
study:  
• Adverse events (AEs)  
• Waist Circumference  
• Clinical laboratory parameters including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis  
• Vital signs (oral temperature, respiratory rate, orthostatic blood pressure, and heart 
rate) 
• Electrocardiogram parameters (Uncorrected QT,  QTcF, QTcB, PR, RR, and QRS 
intervals)  
• Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
• Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) 
• Simpson- Angus Scale (SAS)  
• Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)  
See Section  8.3.9.3 for more details regarding safety assessment questionnaires.  
13.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a  pharmaceutical product. The occurrence, which may or may not have a causal 
relationship with the investigational treatment, may include any clinical or laboratory change that does not commonly occur in that subject and is considered clinically significant. 
Illnesses present prior to the subject signing the informed consent form (ICF) are considered to 
be pre-existing conditions and are documented on the medical history eCRF. Pre- existing 
conditions that worsen during the study are entered on the AE eCRF. 
All out-of- range laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically 
significant by the investigator. Clinically significant values will be considered AEs and recorded 
as such on the eCRFs. 
Pregnancy is not considered an AE, although a subject will be withdrawn from the study if a 
pregnancy occurs. As described in Section  8.4.1, the pregnancy must be reported to Alkermes 
and additional follow-up may be required. 
13.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that meets one or more of 
the following criteria:  
Page 47 of 111
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. The subject is at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurs. This does not include reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Hospital 
admission for elect ive surgery scheduled prior to study entry is not considered an 
SAE  
• Results in disability/incapacity (eg, a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that ma y not result in death, be immediately life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered to be SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed above.  
13.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The assessment of study drug relationship to each AE will be reported on the appropriate source 
document (and SAE form, in the event of an SAE) by the investigator (or designated 
sub-investigator) accord ing to his/her best clinical judgment. The criteria listed in Table 5 should 
be used to guide this assessment. Please note that not all criteria must b e present to be indicative 
of a particular drug relationship. All study drugs are considered “test drugs” for the purposes of the definitions listed in the table.

13.4. Monitoring and Recording of Adverse Events  
Adverse event data collection will begin after a subject signs the ICF and will continue until 
completion of the final study  visit (Visit 19 for subjects completing the study or the final 
monthly visit for subjects discontinuing study drug, but returning for monthly visits). Any AE or 
SAE having an onset after the  final study visit will not be reported unless the investigator feels 
that the event may be related to the study drug.  
Subjects will be instructed by the investigator or designee to report the occurrence of any AE. All volunteered, elicited, and observed AEs are to be recorded on the AE eCRFs. 
The investigator will assess all AEs regarding any causal relationship to the study drug (see 
Section  13.3), the intensity (severity) of the event, action taken, and subject outcome. 
The following criteria should be used to guide the assessment of intensity (severity): 
• Mild:  Causes awareness of sign or symptom, but is easily tolerated; does not interfere 
with usual activities  
• Moderate:  Causes discomfort enough to interfere with usual activities  
• Severe:  Is incapacitating; results in inability to work or perform usual activities  
All AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the investigator, or until the 
subject is deemed by the investigator  to be lost to follow-up. 
For clinical study safety reporting purposes, the most recent version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure will be used as the reference document to designate event expectedness.  
Withdrawal from the study as a result of an AE and any therapeutic measures that are taken shall 
be at the discretion of the investigator . If a subject withdraws from the study for any reason , any 
ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the investigator, or until 
the subject is deemed by the investigator  to be lost to follow -up. 
13.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be reported to  within 1 business day of 
discovery, by emailing:  or faxing the report to the 
following:  
Attention:  Medi cal Monitor 
US Fax Number:  
EU Fax Number:  
The written report should be submitted on the SAE form provided for this purpose. The report 
must include the investigator’s opinion as to whether the event is study drug- related. If this 
relationship is determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely r elated to study drug, evidence 
to support this assessment must also be provided.

14. STATISTICS  
14.1. Sample Size Considerations  
The initial target sample size is 200 randomized subjects per treatment group (400 in total).  This 
sample size will provide at least 90% power to detect a significant difference in mean percent 
change in body weight at Week 24 of 4% or more (3. 0% on ALKS 3831 vs 7% on olanzapine 
group with standard deviation of 9%) and a 13% difference in proportion of subjects with ≥10% 
weight gain at Week 24 (1 4% on ALKS 3831 vs 27% on olanzapine group). 
An unblinded interim analysis is planned to be conducted to determine if the final sample size 
will be increased to 540 (270 subjects per treatment group Section  14.7).  
14.2. General Statistical Methodology  
The statistical analysis methods are described below. Additional details will be provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
In general, summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and maximum for continuous variables, and number [%] of subjects in each category for categorical variables) will be provided by treatment group for all variables.  
Source data for the summary tables and statistical analyses will be presented as subject data 
listings.  
All statistical tests and confidence intervals, unless stated otherwise, will be 2 -sided and will be 
set at α=0.05.  
14.2.1. Study Populations  
14.2.1.1. Safety Population 
The safety population includes all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug (ALKS 3831 or olanzapine). 
14.2.1.2. Efficacy Population 
The efficacy population includes: 
• Full analysis set (FAS)  population: all subjects in the safety population who have at 
least one postbaseline weight assessment  
• Early weight gain population: all subjects in the FAS population who gain weight 
(>0 kg) at Week 1  
14.3. Demographics and Baseline Data  
Demographics and baseline characteristics such as gender, age, race, weig ht, BMI, and 
psychiatric history will be summarized by treatment group. If there are heterogeneities between 
study groups in any of the subject characteristics that are of clinical importance or could affect 
Page 51 of 111
  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
the treatment outcome, the impact of the imbalan ces will be investigated and, if necessary, 
appropriate adjustments made in the efficacy and safety analyses.  
Medical history will be summarized for the safety population using the number of observations 
and percentage of subjects reporting each category.  
14.4. Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy analyses will be based on the relevant efficacy population. Baseline for the primary 
efficacy analysis is defined as the last non -missing assessment before the first dose of the 
double- blind study drug. All statistical tests will be two-sided hypothesis tests performed at the 
5% significance level. All confidence intervals will be two -sided 95% confidence intervals, 
unless specified otherwise.  
Primary Endpoint s 
The primary endpoints are: 
• Percent change from baseline in body weight  at Week 24  in the FAS population 
• Proportion of subjects with ≥10% weight gain at Week 24 in  the FAS population 
For percent change from baseline in body weight at Week 24, the primary analysis will be carried out using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) method. The ANCOVA model will 
include treatment group , race (Black or African American, non-Black or African American ), and 
age (<30, ≥30) as factor s, and baseline weight as a covariate. Missing values will be addressed 
using a multiple imputation (MI) approach, as described in the SAP. The variables in the MI 
model will at least include the same variables as used in the ANCOVA model. Additional 
sensitivity analyses will be carried out to explore the impact of missing data.  
For proportion of subjects with ≥10% weight gain at Week 24, the primary analyses will be 
carried out using a logistic regression model. The model will include treatment group, race 
(Black or African American, non-Black or African American ), and age (<30, ≥30) as factor s, and 
baseline wei ght as a covariate.  Missing values will be addressed using the MI approach, as  
described  above. 
Key S econdary Endpoint  
The key secondary endpoint is : 
• Proportion of subjects with ≥7% weight gain at Week 24 
The key secondary endpoint will be analyzed using the same approach as the analysis for the 
proportion of subjects with ≥10% weight gain at Week 24 in the FAS population. 
A fixed sequence approach will be used to control overall Type I error rate. First, b oth primary 
endpoints will be te sted at an alpha level of 0.05. If both primary endpoints are statistically 
significant, the key secondary endpoint will be tested at an alpha level of 0.05.

  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Other Endpoints  
Other endpoints are: 
• Percent change from baseline in body weight at Week 24  in the early weight gain 
population 
• Proportion of subjects with ≥10% weight gain at Week 24 in the early weight gain 
population  
• Change from baseline in fasting lipids (fasting triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein 
[LDL ], high -density lipoprotein [ HDL ], total cholesterol),  fasting glucose, fasting 
insulin , and HbA1c by visit 
• Absolute change in body weight by visit 
• Change from baseline in waist circumference by visit  
• Change from baseline in PANSS total score and subscales by visit 
• Change from baseline in C GI-S by visit 
• CGI-I score by visit  
• Change from baseline in IWQOL- Lite total score and subscales by visit  
• Change from baseline in EQ-5D score by visit 
The body weight - and waist circumference -related  endpoints will be analyzed in the same 
manner  as the co -primary endpoints. An ANCOVA model will be used for continuous endpoints. 
The model will include treatment group , race (Black or African American, non-Black or African 
American ), and age (<30, ≥30) as factor s, and baseline value as a covariate. A  logistic r egression 
model will be used for categorical endpoint, adjusting for the same covariates . Missing values 
will be addressed by an MI approach.  
Change from baseline in fasting lipids (fasting triglycerides, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol) and fasting glucose , fasting insulin , and HbA1c will be analyzed by a mixed model with repeated 
measurements  (MMRM) model. The model will include treatment, visit, treatment- by-visit 
interaction term, race (Black or African American, non-Black or African American ) and age 
(<30 , ≥30) as categorical fixed effect s; the baseline value will be included as a covariate.   
Change from baseline in PANSS, CGI- S, IWQOL -Lite and EQ -5D will be analyzed by MMRM 
model. The model will include treatment, visit,  and treatment -by-visit interactio n term as 
categorical fixed effect s; the baseline value will be included as a covariate.   
PANSS responder status (<20%, ≥20% improvement over baseline PANSS ), CGI-I score , and 
CGI-I responder status (≤2 vs >2) will be presented by summary statistics.  
14.5. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Listings will be provided for concentrations of olanzapine, samidorphan, and metabolites of 
interest .

  Alkermes, Inc.  
Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
14.6. Safety and Tolerability Analyses  
The safety analysis will be carried out using the Safety Population. For each safety parameter, 
the last assessment of the parameter before the first dose of randomized study drug will be used 
as the baseline for all analyses of that safety parameter. All safety analyses will be based on 
observed data only, and no missing values will be imputed. 
Reported adverse event terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by preferred term and  system organ class categories.  
The number and percentage of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized 
by treatment group by system organ class, and preferred terms within each system organ class. 
Subjects with SAEs, and AEs contributing to discontinuation will also be  summarized.  
Observed valu es and change from baseline in BMI, waist circumference, laboratory parameters, 
vital signs, and ECG parameters will be summarized by treatment group and study visit.  
The number and percentage of subjects who have met potentially  clinically significant (PCS) 
criteria at any post baseline visit will be summarized by treatment group for laboratory, vital 
signs, weight, and ECG parameters. Supporting listings will be provided.  
The number and percentage of subjects with shifts in laboratory and extra pyramidal symptoms 
(EPS) parameters (AIMS, BARS, and SAS) will also be summarized by treatment group. 
Supporting listings will be provided.  
The number and percentage of subjects with C-SSRS assessments of suicidal ideation and 
behavior wi ll also be summarized.  
Prior and concomitant medication use will be summarized by World Health Organization 
(WHO) Drug Dictionary Anatomical Therapeutic Class (ATC) code and by treatment group.  
Listings will be provided for all safety endpoints. 
14.7. Interim Analysis 
 One unblinded interim analysis will be conducted by an independent statistical center (ISC) 
when 50% of subjects (N=200) have completed the double-blind treatment period or have 
discontinued from the study. The details regarding the conduct of the unblinded interim analysis will be specified in the interim analysis operational plan and the statistical testing methodology 
will be specified in the interim analysis plan (IAP).  
The conditional power (CP) will be computed for both primary endpoints. Based on the 
conditional power, it will be assigned into one of 3 zones: favorable (CP ≥90%), promising 
(30% ≤ CP <90%), or unfavorable (CP <30%). The target sample size of 200 per arm will be 
increased to 270 subjects per arm when the conditional power for either primary endpoint is in the promising zone and neither of the primary endpoints is in the unfavorable zone. Otherwise, 
the target sample size will be maintained at 200 subjects per arm. Overall Type 1 error  rate for 
the final analysis  are maintained using CHW method ( Cui et al, 1999) by combining the Z  test 
statistics from two  independent stages (before and after the interim analysis) with a fixed weight 
based on the original sample size. There will be no early stopping for efficacy or futility. The 
sponsor will not be informed with any unblinded interim analysis results except for a

17.1. Ethics Review  
The clini cal site’s IRB/IEC must meet all relevant regulatory requirements. The study protocol 
and ICF will be reviewed by the IRB/IEC prior to enrolling subjects into the study; written 
approval from the committee must be received by Alkermes before drug will be released to 
the investigator. The protocol must be re-approved by the IRB/IEC upon receipt of amendments 
and annually, as local regulatory requirements require.  
The investigator is responsible for submitting all protocol changes and SAE reports to the 
IRB/IEC according to local procedures. At a minimum, all SAEs requiring an investigational 
new drug safety report must be immediately reported.  
All relevant correspondence from the IRB/IEC will be forwarded by the respective study site to 
the sponsor in a timely fashion.  
17.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH Guideline E6, and all 
applicable local regulatory requirements. GCP is an international ethical and scientific quality 
standard used for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies involving the 
participation of human subjects. Alkermes is committed to complying with this standard to provide assurance that the rights, safety, and well -being of study subjects will be protected, 
consistent with the principles having their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
17.3. Written Informed Consent  
The investigator (or authorized designee) at each center will ensure that the subject (or the subject’s legal representative) is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, potential and possible risks and benefits of the study. Each prospective subject 
will receive an IRB-approved informed consent form (ICF) that summarizes the pertinent study 
information and will be given ample time to read the form and ask questions about the study. All 
information is to be provided in a language understandable to the subject and must not include 
any language that waives the subject’s legal rights. Prospective subjects must also be informed of 
their right to withdraw consent without prejudice at any time during the study. If the subject 
chooses to participate, he/she must sign the ICF before any study- specific procedures are 
conducted. 
All subjects will be informed of their rights to pr ivacy and will be made aware that the study data 
will be submitted to Alkermes, the IRB, the contract research organization (CRO) if applicable, 
and to regulatory authorities for review and evaluation for the duration of the study and until the 
project has  been approved for marketing, or is withdrawn from investigation. They will also be 
informed that the study monitor may inspect their medical records to verify the accuracy and 
completeness of the study records and results.

Protocol ALK3831-A303 Amendment 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
Significant changes to the proto col or product safety information may require a revision of the 
ICF, which must be reviewed and approved by the IRB, and then signed by all applicable study 
participants.  
The time that informed consent is obtained must be documented. The investigator must maintain 
the original, signed ICF in the subject’s source documents. A copy of the signed ICF must be 
given to the subject.

18. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPING  
An overview of study data handling and recordkeeping procedures and restrictions is provided in 
the subsequent sections; please refer to the CSA for further details. 
18.1. Data Capture  
As stated in Section  16.1, this study will use eCRFs for capturing da ta. All entries, corrections, 
and alterations will be made by the investigator or other authorized study personnel. All data entries will be verified for accuracy and correctness by independent monitors. The electronic data capture system maintains a full audit trail.  
All electronic source data collected outside of the eCRF such as central laboratory data will be transferred directly to Alkermes for incorporation into the final datasets. A paper copy of all laboratory reports will remain with the source doc uments at the study site. All out of range 
laboratory values will be deemed as clinically significant or not clinically significant by the investigator. Clinically significant values will be considered AEs and  recorded as such on the 
eCRFs.  
18.2. Inspection of R ecords  
Alkermes or its representative will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigational facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, 
subject charts and source documents, and other records relative to study conduct. 
18.3. Retention of Records 
Retention and storage of all essential clinical study documents shall be governed by the terms 
and conditions of the site’s CSA and in accordance with ICH guidelines/local regulatory requirements as follows: 
Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of the investigational product. These documents should be retained for a 
longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by the terms of the CSA. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when 
these documents no longer need to be retained. 
Subjects’ medical files should be retained in accordance with the applicable legislation and in 
accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution, or private 
practice.  
18.4. Use of Information and Publication Policy  
Data generated in this study are proprietary information that is th e sole property of Alkermes. 
Results of the study are to be held in confidence by both the investigators and the sponsor. Please refer to the CSA for details on the procedures for publishing and presenting data.

British Journal of Psychiatry 154:672-676, 1989.  Clintara Version 1.6 June, 2011 
Page 1 of 1Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS)
Instructions: Patient should be observed while they are seated, and then standing while engaged in neutral conversation (for a 
minimum of two minutes in each position). Symptoms observed in other situations, for example, while engaged in activity on the ward, may also be rated. Subsequently, the subjective phenomena should be elicited by direct questioning.  
Please circle the appropriate scores.  
Objective
0 Normal, occasional fidgety movements of the limbs
1 Presence of characteristic restless movements: shuffling or tramping movements of the legs/feet, or swinging of 
one leg while sitting, and/or rocking from foot to foot or “walking on the spot” when standing, but movements
present for less than half the time observed 
2 Observed phenomena, as described in (1) above, which are present for at least half the observation period 
3 Patient is constantly engaged in characteristic restless movements, and/or has the inability to remain seated or
standing without walking or pacing, during the time observed 
Subjective 
Awareness of restlessness
0 Absence of inner restlessness
1 Non-specific sense of inner restlessness 
2 The patient is aware of an inability to keep the legs still, or a desire to move the legs, and/or complains of inner
restlessness aggravated specifically by being required to stand still 
3 Awareness of an intense compulsion to move most of the time and/or reports strong desire to walk or pace most
of the time 
Distress related to restlessness
0 No distress 
1 Mild 
2 Moderate 
3 Severe 
Global Clinical Assessment of Akathisia
0 Absent .No evidence of awareness of restlessness. Observation of characteristic movements of akathisia in the
absence of a subjective report of inner restlessness or compulsive desire to move the legs should be classified 
as pseudoakathisia 
1 Questionable .Non-specific inner tension and fidgety movements
2 Mild akathisia .Awareness of restlessness in the legs and/or inner restlessness worse when required to stand
still. Fidgety movements present, but characteristic restless movements of akathisia not necessarily observed. Condition causes little or no distress 
3 Moderate akathisia .Awareness of restlessness as described for mild akathisia above, combined with
characteristic restless movements such as rocking from foot to foot when standing. Patient finds the condition 
distressing 
4 Marked akathisia .Subjective experience of restlessness includes a compulsive desire to walk or pace.
However, the patient is able to remain seated for at least five minutes. The condition is obviously distressing.
5 Severe akathisia. The patient reports a strong compulsion to pace up and down most of the time. Unable to sit
or lie down for more than a few minutes. Constant restlessness which is associated with intense distress and 
insomnia. 
Rater Signature: _______________________ Date: _________________________
Scoring the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) 
The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale is scored as follows:  Objective Akathisia, Subjective Awareness of Restlessness and Subjective Distress Related to Restlessness are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 – 3 and are summed yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 9.  
The Global Clinical Assessment of Akathisia uses a 5-point scale ranging from 0 – 4. SAMPLEervation peervation

extrapyramidal side effects. Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica 212:11-19, 1970. Revised Clintara Version 1.5 June, 2011
Page 1 of 3 SIMPSON ANGUS RATING SCALE 
Circle the appropriate score for each item :
1. GAIT
The patient is examined as he walks into the examining room: his gait, the swing of arms, his 
general posture; all form the basis for an overall score for this item. This is rated as follows:
0 Normal
1 Mild diminution in swing while the patient is walking
2 Obvious diminution in swing suggesting shoulder rigidity
3 Stiff gait with little or no arm swing noticeable
4 Rigid gait with arms slightly pronated; or stopped-shuffling gait with propulsion and retropulsion
2. ARM DROPPING
The patient and the examiner both raise their arms to shoulder height and let them fall to their 
sides. In a normal subject a stout slap is heard as the arms hit the sides. In the patient with 
extreme Parkinson’s syndrome, the arms fall very slowly.
0 Normal, free fall with loud slap and rebound
1 Fall slowed slightly with less audible contact and little rebound
2 Fall slowed, no rebound
3 Marked slowing, no slap at all
4 Arms fall as though against resistance; as though through glue
3. SHOULDER SHAKING
The subject’s arms are bent at a right angle at the elbow and are taken one at a time by the
examiner who grabs one hand and also clasps the other around the patient’s elbow. The subject’s upper arm is pushed to and fro and the humerus is externally rotated. The degree of resistance 
from normal to extreme rigidity is scored as follows:
0 Normal
1 Slight stiffness and resistance
2 Moderate stiffness and resistance

Page 2 of 3 4. ELBOW RIGIDITY
The elbow joints are separately bent at right angles and passively extended and flexed, with thesubject’s biceps observed and simultaneously palpated. The resistance to this procedure is rated. 
(The presence of cogwheel rigidity is noted separately.)
0 Normal
1 Slight stiffness and resistance
2 Moderate stiffness and resistance
3 Marked rigidity with difficulty in passive movement 
4 Extreme stiffness and rigidity with almost a frozen joint
5. WRIST RIGIDITY OR FIXATION OF POSITION
The wrist is held in one hand and then the fingers held by the examiner’s other hand with the wrist 
moved to extension, and both ulnar and radial deviation. The resistance to this procedure is rated:
0 Normal
1 Slight stiffness and resistance
2 Moderate stiffness and resistance
3 Marked rigidity with difficulty in passive movement
4 Extreme stiffness and rigidity with almost a frozen joint
6. LEG PENDULOUSNESS
The patient sits on a table with his legs hanging down and swinging free. The ankle is grasped by 
the examiner and raised until the knee is partially extended. It is then allowed to fall. The
resistance to falling and the lack of swinging form the basis for the score on this item:
0 The legs swing freely
1 Slight diminution in the swing of the legs
2 Moderate resistance to swing
3 Marked resistance and damping of swing
4 Complete absence of swing
7. HEAD ROTATION
The patient sits or stands and is told that you are going to move his head side to side, that it will not hurt and that he should try and relax. (Questions about pain in the cervical area or difficulty in moving his head should be obtained to avoid causing any pain.) Clasp the patient’s head between the two hands with fingers on back of the neck. Gently rotate the head in a circular motion 3 times 
and evaluate the muscular resistance to the movement.
0 Loose, no resistance
1 Slight resistance to movement although the time to rotate may be normal
2 Resistance is apparent and time of rotation is slowed
3 Resistance is obvious and rotation is slowed

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these ar e separate events; must ask about all types)  Lifetime Past __ 
Years 
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill 
oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is  any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide 
attempt.  There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in 
mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumsta nces. For example, a 
highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g. gunshot to head, jumping  from window of a 
high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be in ferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anything to harm yourself? Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do? Did you______ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  Were you trying to end your life when you _____? Or Did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY inte ntion of killing yourself (lik e to relieve stress, feel better, 
get sympathy, or get something else to happen
)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self-injurious act  (if not for that, actual attempt would 
have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather t han an interrupted 
attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once 
they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken  down from ledge. 
Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

 ADDENDUM A. SUBSTUDY TO PROTOCOL ALK3831 -A303 (FOR 
SELECTED SITES ONLY) 
Introduction  and Rationale  
Weight gain is a well-documented side effect  associated with olanzapine use (Eli Lilly and 
Company 2016) and thus is the primary efficacy measure in ALK3831- A303 (see Section 5.1 of 
the protocol). In addition to weight gain, changes to body composition (ie , increases in total fat 
mass and in visceral fat accumulation ) have also been observed with olanzapine use in subjects 
with schizophrenia ( Ader et al, 2008; Graham et al, 2005). 
Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is a method of measuring body composition in which an 
electrical current is passed through the body and an impedance value is generated  based on body 
height and the measured electrical conductance.  Because fat mass and lean mass conduct 
electricity differently, the relative proportion of each tissue type can be derived from the 
impedance value ( Ellis 2000).  
Advancements in bioelectrical impedance technology allow for body composition measurements 
that can be collected  uniformly across clinical trial sites  without additional burden to the subjects 
in contrast to other methods such as dual- energy X -ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and magnetic 
resonance imagin g (MRI). Using BIA, t his substudy will evaluate body composition in a subset 
of subjects at a select number of sites participating in ALK3831-A303. As this is an exploratory 
substudy, body composition will be measured at two timepoints to provide data which may 
inform future studies. 
Objective 
The objective of this exploratory substudy is to determine body composition during Visit 2 and 
at the end of t reatment  (Visit 17/ early termination  [ET]) of subjects who are participating in 
study ALK3831-A303. 
Selection of Subjects  
Eligible s ubjects who are at an ALK3831-A303 site participating in the substudy and who sign a 
separate consent will have these additional assessments collected if they meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria below.  
Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Each subject must meet both of the following inclusion criteria to be qualified to participate in 
this substudy. 
1. Enrolled in study ALK3831-A303 at a site equipped with a body composition analyzer 
2. Consented to have body composition analysis conducted on or prior to Visit 2

 Subject Exclusion  Criteria 
Each subject must not meet the following criteria to be qualified to participate in this substudy. 
1. Subjects with an electronic implant or devices of any kind (eg, pacemaker, infusion 
pump) or any active or powered  prostheses.  
Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects may withdraw consent from participation in this  substudy at any time. If they do so, 
they may continue full participation in the main ALK3831-A303 study. 
Substudy Design  
The s ubstudy will be conducted in up to 200 subjects participating in the main ALK3831-A303 
study. The s ubstudy will be completed in conjunction with the main study protocol. Subjects 
who enroll in the substudy will complete all the study procedures described in the main study 
protocol (see  Table 1). Additionally, subjects in the substudy will have a body composition 
assessment done prior to dosing at Visit 2 (confirmation of eligibility and randomization visit) 
and then again upon completion of the study at Visit 17/ET (see Table 1).

 Body Impedance Analysis  Procedure  
Body composition will be assessed using the Seca Medical Body Composition Analyzer 
(mBCA  514). For the body composition measurements, subjects should be asked to void 
immediately prior to measurement and should be dressed in a hospital gown with consistent under-attire for each measurement. Subjects should remove all personal items (including shoes, watches, and jewelry) and they should be standing on the same scale for each measurement 
under the same condition. At timepoints when body composition is measured, subjects will be 
asked to stand on the two separate study-supplied scales. The body composition analysis should 
not be performed when the subject is attached to any portable electronic equipment ( eg, a 
portable electrocardiogram  machine). 
Substudy Exploratory Endpoints  
This substudy will assess the following exploratory endpoints: 
• Absolute change from baseline in lean mass  
• Absolute change from baseline in fat mass  
• Change from baseline in percent body fat 
Statistical Analysis 
The analysis will be car ried out using ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) model with t reatment 
group, race (Black or African American, Non -Black or African American), and baseline age 
(<30, ≥30 years) as factors, and the baseline value as the covariate.  Please refer to the statistic al 
analysis plan (SAP)  for analysis details.  Results from the substudy will be provided in an 
addendum, which will be included as an appendix of the main ALK3831-A303 clinical study repo 
rt. 
Safety Reporting 
Adverse events and serious adverse events will be captured and reported in accordance with the 
main ALK3831-A303 study ( Section 13 of the protocol ).  
Informed Consent  
A separate informed consent will be obtained from subjects who voluntarily agree to participate 
in the BIA substudy. The Informed Consent Form reflecting this substudy will be submitted for review and approval to the responsible Institutional Review Board ( IRB). 
Institutional Review Board  
The Informed Consent Form for this substudy will be submitted for revie w and approval to the

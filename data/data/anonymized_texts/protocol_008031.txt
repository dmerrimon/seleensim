The purpose of this amendment is to add the Phase  2 Extension part to test 3 dose levels of 
mRNA -1010 (6.25, 12.5, and 25 µg total mRNA; Vaccination Groups 1 to 3).  
The summary of changes table provided here describes the major changes made in Amendment  4 
relative to Amendment  3, including the sections modified and the corresponding rationales. As

antibodies at all dose levels tested . 
In the Phase  2 Extension part of the 
study, the Sponsor intends to test 
lower dose levels of 6.25  and 
12.5 µg. Thus, the Phase  2 
Extension part will evaluate the 
immunogenicity of mRNA -1010 at 
proposed total dose levels of 6.25, 
12.5, and 25  µg in addition to an 
active comparator.

Overall Study Design: This first -in-human  study is a Phase  1/2, randomized, observer -blind, 
dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA -1010 
vaccine in adult participants ≥  18 years of age. The study comprises 3  parts: Phase  1/2, Phase  2 
NH, and Phase 2 E xtension.  
The Phase 1/2 part of the study will be a randomized, observer -blind, dose -ranging, 
placebo -controlled study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 
mRNA -1010 vaccine in healthy adult participants ≥  18 years of age. The Phas e 2 NH and 
Phase  2 Extension parts of the study will be randomized, observer -blind, dose -ranging, 
active -controlled studies to evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of 
mRNA -1010 vaccine in medically stable adults 18 years and older.  
All p articipants in each part of the study will participate in a screening period (up to 28  days 
before Day  1), treatment period (single dose of vaccine on Day  1), and a follow -up period (up 
to 6 months after vaccination).  
In the Phase 1/2 part of the study, the mRNA -1010 vaccine to be tested includes messenger 
RNAs (mRNAs) that encode for the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinins (HAs) of the following 
influenza virus strains recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for 2020 -2021

The Phase 1/2 part of the study comprises 6 scheduled study site visits: screening, Day  1, Day  8, 
Day 29 (Month  1), Day 57 (Month 2), and Day 181 (Month 6). The Phase 2 NH and Phase  2 
Extension parts of the study comprise 5 scheduled study site visits: Screening, Day 1, Day 29 
(Month  1), Day 91 (Month  3), and Day  181 (Month  6). The Phase 2 Extension part also contains 
an optional study site visit on Day 4 for blood sample collection. There are also scheduled safety 
phone calls to collect medically attended adverse events (MAAEs), adverse events (AEs) 
leading to withdrawal from study participation, serious AEs (SAEs), AEs of special interest 
(AESIs), information about concomitant medica tions associated with these events, and 
information about receipt of nonstudy vaccinations temporally associated with these events. 
These phone calls are scheduled monthly from Day  91 through Day  151 in the Phase 1/2 part 
and on Days  8 and 15 in the Phase  2 NH and Phase 2 Extension parts of the study.  
The study duration will be approximately 7  months for each participant enrolled in each part of 
the study: a screening period of up to 1  month and a study period of 6  months that includes a 
single dose of vacc ine on Day 1. The participant’s final visit (ie, end of study [EoS]) will be on 
Day 181 (Month 6), six  months after the study vaccination.  
All participants in each part of the study will be followed for safety and reactogenicity. On 
Day 1, participants wil l be instructed how to document, and report solicited adverse reactions 
(ARs) and influenza -like illness (ILI) symptoms (for Phase 2 NH part only) with a provided 
electronic diary (eDiary). Solicited ARs will be assessed for 7  days (the day of injection an d the 
following 6 days) after the study vaccination, and unsolicited AEs will be assessed for 28  days 
after the study vaccination; SAEs, AESIs, and MAAEs will be assessed from Day  1 throughout 
the study.  
All participants in the Phase 1/2 part of the study will provide nasopharyngeal (NP) swab 
samples before the injection on Day  1 for assessment of asymptomatic infection with respiratory 
pathogens, including influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  2 
(SARS -CoV -2). A study site visit or a consultation (unscheduled study visit) will be arranged 
within 24  hours or as soon as possible to collect an NP swab sample if participants experience 
symptoms consistent with the United States (US) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  
(CDC) def inition of ILI and/or coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID -19) during the course of the 
study.

Confidential  Page 14 For the Phase 2 NH part, as part of the safety assessments, active and passive surveillance for 
ILI will be conducted between Day 1 through Day  181/EoS. For active su rveillance, participants 
will be instructed to report whether ILI symptoms have been experienced, 3 to 4  times weekly 
from Day  1 through Day  29 and twice weekly from Day  30 through Day  181/EoS, via eDiary 
or telephone calls. If symptoms occur, participants  will be directed to return to the study site as 
soon as possible, but no later than 72 hours after the onset of symptoms, for medical evaluation 
and an NP swab. Participants will be contacted by the study site if they have missed reporting 
in the eDiary. If there is no response to an eDiary prompt for 2  consecutive entries, the study 
site staff will contact the participant by telephone. For passive surveillance, participants will be 
instructed to report symptoms of ILI any time from Day  1 through Day  181/E oS. Participants in 
the Phase  2 NH part who manifest protocol -defined ILI between Day  1 through Day  29 will be 
evaluated by real -time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) testing of an 
NP specimen for influenza (and other respiratory pa thogens ). An NP swab specimen for 
pathogens, including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2 will be collected any time from Day 1 
through Day 181/EoS if participants have protocol -defined ILI or symptoms suggestive of 
COVID -19 or other upper or lower respiratory  infection at the Investigator’s discretion.  
For the Phase 2 Extension part, a study site visit or a consultation (unscheduled study visit) will 
be arranged within 72 hours after the onset of symptoms to collect an NP swab sample if 
participants experience  symptoms consistent with the US CDC definition of ILI and/or 
COVID -19 during the course of the study.  
All participants in the Phase 1/2 part of the study will provide a blood specimen before injection 
on Day  1 and additional blood specimens through the ne xt 6 months  for immunogenicity (on 
Days  8, 29, and 181/EoS). In the Phase  2 NH and Phase 2 Extension parts, all participants will 
provide a blood specimen for immunogenicity assessments before injection on Day  1 and then 
on Day  29. In addition, blood sampl es from a subset of participants at Days 91 and 181/EoS 
may be used for additional assessments. The Phase 2 Extension part also contains an optional 
study site visit on Day 4 for blood sample collection for potential biomarker analysis. 
Furthermore, blood samples for safety or other medical concerns may be collected according to 
the Investigator’s judgment at scheduled study site visits during each part of the study.  
Participants may experience AEs that necessitate an unscheduled visit. There may also be 
situations in which the Investigator asks a participant to report for an unscheduled visit following 
the report of an AE. Additional examinations may be conducted at these visits as necessary to 
ensure the safety and well -being of participants during the stu dy. Electronic case report forms 
should be completed for each unscheduled visit.

placebo in the Phase  1/2 part; mRNA -1010 or the active comparator in the Phase 2 NH and 
Phase 2 Extension parts) or dose level is administered. Participants will receive the IP by 0.5 -mL 
intramuscular (IM) injection on Day  1. All participants, study site staff involved in participant 
assessment, and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will b e blinded to individual dosing 
assignment until the study database is locked and unblinded. Preparation of the IP for 
administration will be conducted on site by an unblinded staff member who has no role in the 
observation or assessment of study participan ts. 
For the Phase 1/2 part, there is 1 planned interim analysis (IA), which will include safety and 
immunogenicity data of all participants (all vaccination groups) after completion of the Day  29 
Visit. For the Phase 2 NH and Phase 2 Extension parts, an IA  of safety (reactogenicity and 
immunogenicity as applicable) will be performed after participants have completed the Day  29 
Visit for each part of the study.  
Immunizations for the Phase 1/2 part of the study are planned during the NH summer and all 
partici pants will be recommended to receive a licensed 2021 -22 NH seasonal influenza vaccine 
during their participation in the study after completion of the Day  29 Visit. Immunizations for 
the Phase 2 NH part of the study are planned during the NH influenza seaso n. Immunizations 
for the Phase 2 Extension part are planned during the NH spring.  
Safety Oversight: Safety monitoring for this study will include blinded study team members, 
inclusive of, at a minimum, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, medical monitor of the  contract 
research organization (CRO), a blinded IST, and an unblinded Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB). The study team will conduct ongoing blinded safety reviews during the study 
and will be responsible for notifying the IST and DSMB of potential safety signal events or the 
triggering of pause rules.  
The IST will consist of at least 2 Sponsor physicians who will be voting members not directly 
involved in the clinical development of the study. For the initial stage in the Phase 1/2 part of 
the study , the IST will conduct a blinded review of all available safety data after at least 
36 participants (9  participants per vaccination group) have completed their Day  8 Visit. 
Vaccination of the remaining participants in the expansion stage will continue in e ach 
vaccination group  if no pause rules have been met and the safety and tolerability are acceptable. 
Prior to the start of the Phase 2 NH part of the study, the IST will also conduct a blinded review 
of available safety data from the Phase  1/2 part. Finally, the IST will also  conduct ad hoc reviews 
as requested by the study medical monitor and the study team.  
An independent unblinded DSMB will be used throughout the conduct of this study. This 
committee will be composed of independent members with relevant therapeutic and/or

Safety Assessments:  
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each participant:  
• Solicited local and systemic ARs that occur during the 7 days following vaccine 
administration (ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days). Solicited ARs w ill 
be recorded daily using eDiaries.  
• Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28 days following vaccine 
administration (ie, the day of injection and 27 subsequent days).  
• AEs leading to discontinuation from study participation from Day  1 through 
Day 181/EoS or withdrawal from the study.  
• MAAEs from Day 1 through Day 181/EoS or withdrawal from the study . 
• SAEs and AESIs from Day 1 through Day 181/EoS or withdrawal from the study.  
• Results of safety laboratory tests (Phase 1/2 part only).  
• Vital sign measu rements.  
• Physical examination findings.  
• Assessments for causes of respiratory infections as needed from Day 1 through 
Day 181/EoS in the Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 Extension parts of the study or 
withdrawal from the study. Active and passive surveillance for IL I (and 
assessments for causes of respiratory infections as needed) will be conducted from 
Day 1 through Day 181/EoS in the Phase  2 NH part of the study.  
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the study 
vaccination on Day  1 and until the end of their participation in the study.  
• Optional blood sample collection on Day 4 in the Phase 2 Extension part.  
Immunogenicity Assessments:  
The following immunogenicity assessments are planned:  
• Serum antibody level as measured by hemaggl utination inhibition (HAI) assay 
(primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints).  
• Serum neutralizing antibody level as measured by microneutralization assay or 
similar method (secondary [Phase 1/2 part only] and exploratory endpoints).

Statistical Methods:  
Hypothesis:  
No formal hypotheses will be tested.  
Sample Size:  
The sample size for this study is not driven by statistical assumptions for formal hypothesis 
testing. The number of proposed participants is considered sufficient to provide a descriptive 
summary of the safety and immunogenicity of di fferent dose levels of mRNA -1010.  
For the Phase 1/2 part of the study, approximately 180 participants will be randomly assigned 
in this study, with approximately 45  participants in each vaccination group . With 45  participants 
receiving an investigational v accine, there is a probability of approximately 90% to observe at 
least 1 participant with an AE, if the true incidence rate of the AE is 5%; if the true incidence 
rate is 10%, then the probability to observe it will be approximately 99%.  
For the Phase 2 NH part of the study, approximately 500 participants will be randomly assigned 
in a 3:3:3:1 ratio to the mRNA -1010 25, 50, 100 µg groups, or the Active Comparator Group. 
A total of 450 participants will receive the mRNA -1010 vaccine (150 participants at ea ch dose 
level). A sample size of 150 participants at each dose level has at least a 95% probability to 
observe at least 1  participant with an AE , if the true incidence rate is 2%; if the true incidence 
rate is 3%, then the probability to observe it will be  99%. 
For the Phase 2 Extension part of the study, approximately 200 participants will be randomly 
assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the mRNA -1010 6.25, 12.5, 25 µg groups, or the Active 
Comparator Group. A total of 150 participants will receive the mRNA -1010  vaccine 
(50 participants at each dose level). With  50 participants receiving an investigational vaccine, 
there is a probability of approximately 92% to observe at least 1 participant with an AE, if the 
true incidence rate of the AE is 5%; if the true inci dence rate is 10%, then the probability to 
observe it will be approximately 99%.

Assessment of safety laboratory tests will be done for the Phase  1/2 part of the study only. The 
number and percen tage of participants who have chemistry and hematology results below or 
above the normal laboratory ranges will be tabulated by time point. For treatment -emergent 
safety laboratory test results, the raw values and change from baseline values will be 
summar ized by vaccination group and visit at each time point.  
For all parts of the study, vital sign results will also be presented.  
Immunogenicity Analyses:  
Immunogenicity analyses in each part of the study will be reported based on the Per -Protocol 
Set and pro vided by vaccination group, unless otherwise specified.  
Phase 1/2  
For the immunogenicity endpoints, geometric mean of specific antibody titers with 
corresponding 95% CI at each time point and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of specific 
antibody titers with  corresponding 95% CI at each postbaseline time point over preinjection 
baseline at Day  1 will be provided by vaccination group . The 95% CIs will be calculated based 
on the t -distribution of the log 2 -transformed values and then back transformed to the ori ginal 
scale. Descriptive summary statistics, including median, minimum, and maximum, will also be 
provided.  
For the calculation of geometric mean titers (GMTs), antibody titers reported as below the lower 
limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be replaced by 0.5 × LLOQ. Values that are greater than the 
upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) will be converted to the ULOQ.  
Seroconversion rate from baseline will be provided with a 2 -sided 95% CI using the 
Clopper -Pearson method at each postbaseline time point. Rate  of seroconversion is defined as 
the proportion of participants with either a prevaccination HAI titer < 1:10 and a postvaccination

postvaccination HAI antibody titer.  
Phase 2 NH  and Phase 2 Extension  
Immune responses, as measured by GMT and seroconversion rate in the mRNA -1010 groups 
based on Day 29 HAI titers, will be compared with that of participants receiving active 
comparator for all 4 strains.  
An analysis of covari ance model will be carried out with HAI titers at Day 29 as a dependent 
variable and a group variable as the fixed variable. The GMT of the mRNA -1010 at Day  29 will 
be estimated by the geometric least square mean (GLSM) from the model. The geometric mean 
ratio (GMTr; ratio of GMT) will be estimated by the ratio of GLSM from the model. The 
corresponding 2 -sided 95%  CI will be provided to assess the difference in immune response 
between the mRNA -1010 compared with the active comparator at Day 29.  
The number a nd percentage of participants with seroconversion due to vaccination will 
be provided with 2 -sided 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method at Day 29. The 
seroconversion rate difference with 95% CI at Day 29 will be provided.  
In addition, the GMT of HAI titers with corresponding 95% CI will be provided at each time 
point. The 95% CIs will be calculated based on the t -distribution of the log 2 -transformed values 
and then back transformed to the original scale. The GMFR of HAI titers with corresponding 
95% CI at each postbaseline time point over baseline will be provided. Descriptive summary 
statistics, including median, minimum, and maximum, will also be provided.  
For summarizations of GMTs, antibody titers reported as LLOQ will be replaced by 
0.5 × LLOQ. V alues that are greater than ULOQ will be converted to the ULOQ.  
Rate of seroconversion is defined as (1) if LLOQ is 1:10 , the proportion of participants with 
either a prevaccination HAI titer < 1:10 and a postvaccination HAI titer ≥  1:40 or a 
prevaccinatio n HAI titer  ≥ 1:10 and a minimum 4 -fold rise in the postvaccination HAI antibody 
titer; or (2) if LLOQ is greater than 1:10, the proportion of participants with either a 
prevaccination HAI titer < LLOQ and a postvaccination HAI ≥ 4 times of LLOQ, or a 
prevaccination HAI ≥ LLOQ and a minimum 4 -fold rise in the postvaccination HAI .  
The HAI titers at Day 29, GMTr at Day 29, and the difference in seroconversion rate at Day  29 
may also be performed with the Full Analysis Set as supplementary analyses.

Study Analyses  
A Day 29 IA is planned in this  study for the Phase 1/2, Phase 2 NH, and Phase  2 Extension part s 
separately. The IA for the Phase 1/2 part will be performed after all participants have completed 
the Day  29 Visit. All relevant data to the IA will be cleaned (ie, data that are as clean as  possible).  
For the Phase 2 NH and the Phase 2 Extension part s, an IA of safety ( reactogenicity  and 
immunogenicity as applicable) will be performed after participants have completed the Day  29 
Visit for each part of the study. All data relevant to the IA t hrough the Day  29 Visit will be 
cleaned (ie, data that are as clean as possible). An interim study report may be generated, in 
which case a formal database lock will be performed to support the interim study report.  
The IAs will be performed by a separate team of unblinded programmers and statisticians. The 
analyses will be presented by vaccination groups. Except for a limited number of Sponsor and 
CRO personnel who will be unblinded to perform the IA, the study site staff, Investigators, study 
monitors, an d participants will remain blinded until after the final database lock for final 
analysis.  
The final analysis of safety, reactogenicity,  and immunogenicity will be performed after all 
participants have completed all planned study procedures. The results of  this analysis will be 
presented in a final clinical study report, including individual listings.

3 Physical examination: A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at  screening. Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at 
other time points at the discretion of the Investigator. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit s hould be reported as an MAAE.  
4 Vital sign measurement: syst olic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. Participants will be seated for at lea st 5 minutes before all 
measurements are taken. Vital signs will be collected at the Screening Visit and on the day of vaccination,  once before and at least 1 hour after the vaccination. Vital signs will be 
collected at other study site visits only in conjunction with a symptom -directed physical examination. The preferred route of temperature assessment is oral. Participants must not 
eat or drink anything hot or cold within 10 minutes before oral temperature is taken. If any of the vital sign measurements m eet the toxicity grading criteria for clinical 
abnormalities of Grade  3 or greater, the abnormal value and grade will be documented  in the AE section of the eCRF (unless there is another known cause of the abnormality that 
would result in an AE classification). The Investigator will continue to monitor the participant with additional assessments until the vital sign value has reached the reference 
range, returns to the vital sign value at baseline, is considered stable or until the Investigator determines that follow -up is no longer medically necessary.  
5 A point -of-care urine pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit and  before the vaccine dose on Day 1. At the discretion of the Investigator, a pregnancy test either 
via blood or point -of-care urine can be performed at any time. The FSH level may be measured at the Screening Visit as necessary and at the discret ion of the Investigator to 
confirm postmenopausal status.

will be collected from approximately 40  participants per vaccination group and assessed in a subset . 
8 An NP swab specimen will be collected on Day 1 prior to vaccination to assess for asym ptomatic infection with respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus and 
SARS -CoV -2. An NP swab will also be collected at any time during the study through study completion if any signs or symptoms or an MAAE s uggesting COVID -19 or ILI 
occur, to confir m the diagnosis by RT -PCR. For signs or symptoms during the study, a participant will be instructed to contact the study site to have an NP swab co llected for 
testing for respiratory pathogens at an unscheduled visit. The NP swabs may be collected as part of a home visit in lieu of a study site visit.   
9 The eDiary entries will be recorded by the participant at approximately 1 hour after vaccination while at the study site unde r the supervision of the study site staff. Participants 
will continue to record d ata in the eDiary for solicited AEs each day after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening and at the same time each day, on the day of 
injection, and for 6  days following injection. Any solicited AR that continues beyond Day 7 will be reporte d until it is no longer reported but only until 28 days after vaccination. 
Adverse reactions recorded in diaries beyond Day  7 should be reviewed either during the next scheduled telephone call or at the next study site visit.  
10 Trained study personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any AEs, MAAEs, AEs leading to withdraw al from study participation, SAEs, AESIs, 
information on concomitant medications associated with those events, and any nonstudy va ccinations.  
11 All nonstudy vaccinations will be recorded through Day 181/EoS. All concomitant medications will be recorded through 28 days after vaccination; all concomitant medications 
relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE, AESI, or MAAE will be rec orded from Day 1 through Day 181/EoS .

1 The Screening Visit and Day 1 Visit may be performed on the same day or a different day. Additionally, the Screening Visit ma y be performed over multiple visits if within the 
28-day screening window.  
2 Verbal confirmation of medical his tory is acceptable.  
3 Physical examination: A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at screening; symptom -directed physical examinations will be performed at all 
other clinic visits (ie, study site visits). Interim physi cal examinations will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator. Any clinically significant finding identified by a 
healthcare professional during study visits should be reported as an MAAE.  
4 Vital sign measurement: Systolic and diastolic blood p ressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. The preferred route of temperature assessment is oral. 
Participants must not eat or drink anything hot or cold within 10 minutes before oral temperature is taken. Participants will  be seated for at least 5 minutes before all 
measurements are taken. Vital signs will be collected on the day of vaccination, once before vaccination and approximately 1 hour after vaccination. Vital signs may be collected 
at other study site visits in conjunction with a  symptom -directed physical examination. If any of the vital sign measurements meet the toxicity grading criteria for clinical

Confidential  Page 38 abnormalities of Grade  3 or greater, the abnormal value and grade will be documented in the AE section of the eCRF (unless there i s another known cause of the abnormality that 
would result in an AE classification). The Investigator will continue to monitor the participant with additional assessments until the vital sign value has reached the reference 
range, returns to the vital sign  value at baseline, is considered stable or until the Investigator determines that follow -up is no longer medically necessary.  
5 A point -of-care urine pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit (and before the vaccine dose on Day 1 if Day 1 is  not on the same day as the Screening Visit). At the 
discretion of the Investigator, a pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care urine can be performed at any time. The FSH level may be measured at the Screening Visit as 
necessary and at the discret ion of the Investigator, to confirm postmenopausal status.  
6 See Table  8 for dose levels and vaccination groups. All participants will be randomized to receive a single 0.5 -mL IM injection.  
7 Samples for humoral immunogenicity (and exploratory assessments) must be collected prior to receipt of vaccination on Day 1. A subset of samples collected will be assessed for 
humoral immunogenicity (and exploratory assessments).  
8 An NP swab specimen for pathogens, including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2 will be collected any  time from Day 1 through Day 181/EoS if participants have 
protocol -defined ILI or symptoms suggestive of COVID -19 or other upper or lower respiratory infection at the Investigator’s discretion. If participants experience these 
symptoms/signs, they will be instructed to contact the study site to have an NP swab collected for testing. The NP swabs may be collected as part of a hom e visit in lieu of a 
study site visit.   
9 The eDiary entries will be recorded by all participants at approximately 1 hour after vac cination while at the study site under the supervision of the study site staff. Participants 
will continue to record data in the eDiary for solicited ARs each day after they leave the study site, preferably in the even ing and at the same time each day, on the day of 
vaccination, and the 6 days following vaccination. Any solicited AR that is ongoing beyond Day 7 will be reported until it is  no longer reported but only until 28  days after 
vaccination. Adverse reactions recorded in the eDiary beyond Day  7 shou ld be reviewed either during the next scheduled call or study site visit, or during an unscheduled visit.  
10 The eDiary will be activated for collection of ILI symptoms.  
11 Passive Surveillance: Participants will be instructed to report symptoms of ILI any  time from Day 1 through Day 181/EoS; Active Surveillance: Participants will be instructed to 
report whether ILI symptoms have been experienced, 3 to 4 times weekly from Day  1 through Day  29 and twice weekly from Day 30 through Day 181/EoS, via eDiary or 
telephone calls. If symptoms occur, participants will be directed to return to the study site as soon as possible, but no late r than 72 hours after the onset of symptoms for medical 
evaluation and an NP swab.  
12 Review of eDiary for recording of symptoms of  ILI. 
13 Trained study personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any MAAEs, AEs leading to study discont inuation, SAEs, AESIs, information on concomitant 
medications associated with those events, and any nonstudy vaccinations.  
14 All nonstudy vaccinations will be recorded through Day 181/EoS. All concomitant medications will be recorded through 28 days after vaccination; all concomitant medications 
relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE, AESI, or MAAE will be recorded from Day 1 through Day  181/EoS.  
15 Participants who develop ILI will be followed through 30 days from the onset of ILI even if Day 30 is beyond Day 181/EoS.

2.1. Study Rationale  
Seasonal influenza viruses are estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to cause 3 to 
5 million cases of severe illness and up to 650,000 deaths each year, which is a severe challenge 
to public health ( WHO 2018 ). Influenza epidemics occur each year and follow a seasonal 
circulation pattern with increased cases during the winter months in the Northern Hemi sphere 
(NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) ( Riedel et al 2019 ). Since influenza viruses continuously 
change through a process termed antigenic drift, the circulating viruses are actively monitored by 
a worldwide monitoring network c oordinated by the WHO ( Monto 2018 ). An expert panel 
recommends certain influenza virus strains for vaccine manufacturing, based on observed 
circulation patterns and antigenic changes, twice a year (once for NH and once for SH). 
Influenza  A and B viruses are the most relevant influenza viruses for human infection. Therefore, 
current vaccine recommendations include 1 influenza A H1N1 strain, 1 influenza  A H3N2 strain, 
and 2 influenza B strains (covering the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata l ineages).  
Currently licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines rarely exceed 60% overall effectiveness and 
are less effective during the years when the circulating viruses do not match the strains selected 
for the vaccine antigens ( CDC 2020a ). Influenza vaccines based on messenger RNA (mRNA) 
technology could provide several benefits compared with current vaccines, including the ability to 
respond to strain changes more quickly; avoidance of mutations that may be acquired during 
vaccine production in eggs or cell culture; stronger immune responses; and improved protection 
in older adults ( Rockman et al 2020 ). 
2.2. Background and Overview  
ModernaTX, Inc. (Sponsor) has developed a rapid response proprietary vacc ine platform based on 
the mRNA delivery system. The platform is based on the principle and observations that cells 
in vivo can take up mRNA, translate it, and then express protein viral antigen(s) on the cell surface. 
The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is 
nonreplicating, and is expressed transiently.  
Two mRNA vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2), 
including Pfizer Inc.’s BNT162b2 ( Polack et  al 2020 ) and the Sponsor’s mRNA -1273 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) have been issued emergency use 
authorizations by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
2.2.1.  mRNA -1010  
The Sponsor is using its mRNA -based platform to develop a novel lipid nanoparticle 
(LNP) -encapsulated mRNA -based vaccine against diseases caused by influenza virus types  A 
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 52 and B. The proposed development candidate mRNA -1010 is a quadrivalent vaccine containing 
mRNAs that encode for the hemagglutinins (HAs) of the 4 strains recommended by the WHO for 
cell- or recombinant -based vaccines. Equal amounts of mRNAs that encode for membrane -bound 
wild-type versions of each of the 4 different strains will be used for the HA components. The 
mRNA -1010 development candidate will be administered as a single intramuscular (IM) injection 
and aims to elicit protection from all seasonal influenza viruses covered by the vaccine.  
The S ponsor is conducting this first -in-human (FIH) Phase 1/2 study of mRNA -1010, a seasonal 
influenza vaccine, to establish preliminary safety, reactogenicity,  and immunogenicity data to 
support the initiation of a Phase 3 program for this vaccine. The design of this study will include 
an immunogenicity objective for the HA component, using HA inhibition (HAI) as a correlate of 
protection against influenza illness. The rationale for this approach is based on the established 
precedent of using HA -based immunolog ic correlates for clinical assessment and licensure of 
influenza vaccines ( DHHS  2007a ; Dunning et al 2016 ; EMA 2016 ). In this FIH study, the safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunoge nicity of mRNA -1010 vaccine will be compared with placebo 
(Phase  1/2 part) and with an active comparator (Phase  2 NH and Phase 2 Extension part s). The 
vaccine administration in the Phase  1/2 part and the Phase 2 Extension part of the study are planned 
outside the NH influenza season. In the Phase  2 NH part, the vaccine administration is planned 
during the NH influenza season.  
2.2.2.  Nonclinical Studies  
Using individually formulated HA -encoding mRNAs (preclinical material), 2  mouse 
immunogenicity studies were perfo rmed. The HA sequences used for preclinical formulation were 
from wild -type HAs.  
Both studies used a prime/boost regimen with a 3 -week interval. Immunized mice were bled on 
Day 21 (3  weeks after the prime dose) and Day 36 (2  weeks after the boost dose), an d 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers were determined with an enzyme -linked immunosorbent 
assay using recombinant HA proteins.  
The first study compared mice immunized with individual mRNAs or a combination of all 4  HA 
mRNAs at 2 different doses (2 or 0. 4 µg of each mRNA), based on the following strains 
recommended for the 2020 -2021 NH influenza season:  
• A/Hawaii/70/2019(H1N1)pdm09  
• A/Hong Kong/45/2019(H3N2)  
• B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)  
• B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 53 High IgG antibody titers were observed against all HAs following immunization, with both 
individual mRNA constructs and mRNA combinations after a single dose. A dose response and 
booster effect were observed for most mRNA constructs (individual and combinations).  
The second  mouse immunogenicity study aimed to confirm that the 2021 SH composition is 
similarly immunogenic with the 2020 -2021 NH composition. The compositions differed only for 
the H1N1 strain; the SH composition included A/Wisconsin/588/2019(H1N1)pdm09 instead of  
the A/Hawaii/70/2019(H1N1)pdm09 strain.  
No difference in immunogenicity (HA IgG antibody titers) based on the strain/mRNA construct 
used for immunization (A/Hawaii/70/2019 in the NH composition versus A/Wisconsin/588/2019 
in the SH composition) was observ ed, suggesting that the mRNA platform will support annual 
strain updates.  
Additional studies to assess protection of mice from challenge with mouse -adapted H1N1 and 
H3N2 viruses after a single immunization and a study to assess immunogenicity and protectio n 
from H1N1 challenge after 2 immunizations in ferrets are currently ongoing. Results will be 
available in the planned investigational new drug (IND) application.  
A detailed review of the nonclinical experience with mRNA -1010 vaccine will be provided in th e 
investigator’s brochure (IB).  
2.2.3.  Clinical Studies  
No clinical studies with mRNA -1010 have been performed to date.  
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
2.3.1.  Known Potential Benefits  
The following benefits may accrue to participants who receive the mRNA -1010 vaccine:  
• The mRNA -1010 vaccine may be effective against seasonal influenza strains as 
defined by the WHO for the 2020 -2021 SH flu season (Phase  1/2) or against the 
seasonal influenza strains as defined by the WHO for the 2021 -2022 NH flu season 
(Phase  2 NH  and Phase 2 Extension).  
• Participants will have a baseline (Day 1) evaluation for respiratory pathogens 
(Phase  1/2 part), including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2, and ongoing 
surveillance for influenza -like illness ( ILI) and/or coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID -19) thro ughout the study (Phase 1/2,  Phase 2 NH, and Phase 2 Extension).  
• The study will contribute to the development of a potentially efficacious vaccine 
against seasonal influenza.

Confidential  Page 54 2.3.2.  Risks From Study Participation and Their Mitigation  
Adverse events (AEs) ranging from immediate mild allergic reactions (eg, urticaria) to systemic 
allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) may occur following any vaccination. Systemic allergic 
reactions are very rare and are estimated to occur once per 450,000 vaccinations for vaccines tha t 
do not contain allergens such as gelatin or egg protein ( Zent et al 2002 ). Since the authorization of 
the mRNA -1273 vaccine for COVID -19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) estimate of the rate of anaphylaxis based on reporting in the Vaccine Adverse Event 
Reporting System is approximately 2.5 cases/million doses administered 
(Shimabukuro  et al 2021 ). As a precaution, all participants will remain under observation at the 
study sit e for at least 60 minutes after injection.  
Vasovagal syncope (fainting) can occur before or after any vaccination, is usually triggered by 
pain or anxiety associated with the injection and is not related to the substance injected. Therefore, 
it is importan t that standard precautions and procedures are followed to avoid injury from fainting.  
Intramuscular injection with other mRNA vaccines manufactured by the Sponsor containing the 
proprietary SM -102 (heptadecan -9-yl 8 -((2-hydroxyethyl)(6 -oxo-6-
(undecyloxy)h exyl)amino)octanoate) lipid formulation have commonly resulted in transient and 
self-limiting local inflammatory reactions. These typically included pain, erythema (redness), or 
swelling (hardness) at the injection site, which were mostly mild to moderate in severity and 
usually occurred within 24  hours of injection. Laboratory abnormalities (including increases in 
liver function tests and serum lipase levels) following injection have been observed in early phase 
clinical studies with similar mRNA -based vac cines. These abnormalities were without clinical 
symptoms or signs and returned toward baseline (Day 1) values over time.  
In a recently completed Phase  3 study of mRNA -1273 vaccine for COVID -19 in 30,420  healthy 
adults, the most commonly reported local reactions included pain, swelling, and erythema at the 
injection site. Most of these reactions were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and resolved within 3 to 4  days 
of onset. The most commonly reported systemic reactions were headache, myalgia, arthralgia, 
fatigue , chills, and fever. In most cases, the reactions resolved spontaneously within several days 
(Baden et al 2021 ). 
Similarly, safety results from Phase  1 studies conducted by the Sponsor on 2 mRNA vaccines 
containing the HA glycoprot eins from the H10N8 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses were well 
tolerated, although the Sponsor’s LNP/mRNA platform has since been updated (eg,  SM-102 is 
used in mRNA -1010 and mRNA -1273; Feldman et al 2019 ). 
There have been very r are reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination with 
COVID -19 mRNA vaccines. The majority of the cases have been reported in young males shortly 
after the second dose of the vaccine. These are typically mild cases and individuals te nd to recover

should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis ( Gargano et al 2021 ). 
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit/Ris k Conclusion  
Three dose levels (50, 100, and 200 µg of total mRNA) of mRNA -1010 vaccine administered as a 
single IM injection will be evaluated in the Phase 1/2 part of the study. The safety, reactogenicity, 
and immunogenicity of the 3 dose levels of mRNA -1010 will be compared with placebo. The study 
schema for the Phase 1/2 part of the study is provided in Figure 1. 
In the Phase 1/2 part of the study, each vaccination group will have 2 stages: initial stage and 
expansion stage. A total of 36  participants (9 participants in each vaccination group) will be  
randomly assigned in the initial stage in parallel fashion. Enrollment and vaccination in the 
expansion stage will begin only after an internal safety team (IST) performs a blinded review of 
all available safety data up to 7 days after vaccination from th e 36 participants in the initial stage 
and determines that no pause rules have been met. As an additional safeguard, the vaccine 
administration in the Phase 1/2 part of this FIH study is planned outside the NH influenza season.  
In the Phase 2 NH part, the three dose levels of mRNA -1010 vaccine to be evaluated are 25, 50, 
and 100 µg of total mRNA  based on interim analysis (IA) of the Phase 1/2 part . In addition, the 
Phase  2 NH part of the study will also include a composition change of mRNA -1010 (strain upda te 
for the 2021 -2022 NH season), as well as the inclusion of a licensed active comparator. In this 
part, vaccine administration is planned during the NH influenza season. The study schema for the 
Phase  2 NH part of the study is provided in Figure 2. 
In the Phase 2 Extension part, the 3 dose levels of mRNA -1010 vaccine to be evaluated are 6.25, 
12.5, and 25 µg of total mRNA based on IA of the Phase 1/2 part . The Phase  2 Extension part of 
the study will include the same composition of mRNA -1010 as the Phase 2 NH part. In this part, 
vaccine administration is planned outside the NH influenza season. The study schema for the 
Phase  2 Extension part of the study i s provided in  Figure 3. 
Serological data from all participants will be used to infer vaccine immunogenicity. All 
participants will be followed up for 6  months after the study vaccination. Safety will be monitored 
throughout the study ( Section 8.4). 
Considering the nonclinical data for the mRNA -1010 vaccine and the safety data for the other 
mRNA vaccines manuf actured by the Sponsor to date that contain the proprietary SM -102 lipid 
formulation, the Sponsor considers the potential benefits of participation to exceed the risks.

4.1. General Design  
This FIH study is a Phase 1/2, randomized, observer -blind, dose -ranging study to evaluate the 
safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of mRNA -1010 vaccine in adult participants 
≥ 18 years of age. The study comprises 3 parts: Phase 1/2,  Phase  2 NH, and Phase  2 Extension.  
The Phase 1/2 part of the study will be a randomized, observer -blind, dose -ranging, 
placebo -controlled study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 
mRNA -1010 vaccine in healthy adult participants ≥  18 years of age. The Phase 2 NH and Phase  2 
Extension parts of the study will be randomized, observer -blind, dose -ranging, active -controlled 
studies to evaluate the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of mRNA -1010 vaccine in 
medically stable adults 18 ye ars and older.  
All participants in each part of the study will participate in a screening period (up to 28  days before 
Day 1), treatment period (single dose of vaccine on Day 1), and a follow -up period (up to 6  months 
after vaccination).  
In the Phase 1/2 p art of the study, the mRNA -1010 vaccine to be tested includes mRNAs that 
encode for the surface glycoprotein HAs of the following influenza virus strains recommended by 
the WHO for 2020 -2021 SH cell - or recombinant -based vaccines:  
• A/Wisconsin/588/2019(H1N1 )pdm09  
• A/Hong Kong/45/2019(H3N2)  
• B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Victoria lineage)

Healthy (Phase 1/2) and medically stable (Phase 2 NH and Phase 2 Extension) adults ≥  18 years 
of age will be screened and enrolled. For the Phase 2 NH and Phase 2 Extension parts,  participants 
with chronic diseases requiring ongoing medical intervention wi thin the last 3 months prior to 
enrollment as well as those with immunocompromising conditions or medications will be 
excluded. The complete lists of inclusion and exclusion criteria for  the Phase  1/2, Phase 2 NH , and 
Phase  2 Extension parts  of the study a re provided in Section  5.1 (Phase  1/2) and Section  5.2

In the Phase 1/2 part, approximately 180 participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio 
to receive mRNA -1010  50 μg, mRNA -1010 100  μg, mRNA -1010 2 00 μg, or placebo, with 
approximately 45  participants randomly assigned to each vaccination group. A total of 
36 participants (9  participants in each vaccination group) will be randomly assigned in the initial 
stage of the study. The IST will perform a bli nded review of all safety data up to 7  days after 
vaccination from the 36  participants in the initial stage. After the IST confirms that no pause rules 
(Section  7.1) have been met in the 36 participants in the initial stage, enrollment will begin in the 
expansion stage. A total of 144  participants (36  participants in each vaccination group) will be 
randomly assigned in the expansion stage of the study.  Randomization in the expansion stage will 
be stratified by age (18 to < 50 years versus ≥  50 years) and will be balanced across the 2 age

Table  1, Table  2, and  Table 3 display the Schedule of Events  (SoE) for the Phase 1/2, Phase  2 NH, 
and Phase 2 Extension parts  of the study, respectively. The Phase  1/2 part of the study comprises 
6 scheduled study site visits: Screening, Day 1, Day 8, Day  29 (Month  1), Day 57 (Month 2), and 
Day 181 (Month  6). The P hase 2 NH and Phase 2 Extension parts of the study comprise 
5 scheduled study site visits: Screening, Day  1, Day  29 (Month  1), Day 91 (Month 3), and Day  181 
(Month  6). The Phase 2 Extension part also contains an optional study site visit on Day 4 for blood  
sample collection. There are also scheduled safety phone calls to collect medically attended AEs 
(MAAEs), AEs leading to withdrawal from study participation, serious AEs (SAEs), AEs of 
special interest (AESIs), information about concomitant medications as sociated with these events, 
and to collect information about receipt of nonstudy vaccinations temporally associated with these 
events. These phone calls are scheduled monthly from Day  91 through Day  151 during the 
Phase  1/2 part and on Days  8 and 15 during  the Phase  2 NH and Phase 2 Extension parts of the 
study.  
The study duration will be approximately 7  months for each participant enrolled in each part of 
the study: a screening period of up to 1  month and a study period of 6  months that includes a single 
dose of vaccine on Day 1. The participant’s final visit will be on Day 181 (Month 6), six  months 
after the study vaccination.  
All participants in each part of the study will be followed for safety and reactogenicity. On Day  1, 
participants will be instructe d how to document, and report solicited adverse reactions (ARs) and 
ILI symptoms (for Phase 2 NH part only) with a provided electronic diary (eDiary) ( Section  8.1.1 ). 
Solicited ARs will be assessed for 7  days (the day of injection and the following 6 days) after the

Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 64 study vaccination, and unsolicited AEs will be assessed for 28  days after the study vaccination; 
SAEs, AESIs, and MAAEs will be assessed f rom Day  1 throughout the study.  
All participants in the Phase 1/2 part of the study will provide nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples 
before the injection on Day  1 for assessment of asymptomatic infection with respiratory pathogens, 
including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2. A study site visit or a consultation (unscheduled study 
visit) will be arranged within 24  hours or as soon as possible to collect an NP swab sample if 
participants experience symptoms consistent with the CDC definition of ILI ( Section  8.4.6 ) and/or 
COVID -19 during the course of the study .  
For the Phase 2 NH part, as part of the safety assessments, active and passive surveillance for ILI 
will be conducted between Day  1 through Day  181/end of study (EoS). For active surveillance, 
participants will be instructed to report whether ILI symptoms have been experienced, 3 to 4 times 
weekly from Day  1 through Day  29 and twice weekly from Day  30 through Day  181/EoS, via 
eDiary or telephone calls. If symptoms occur, participants will be directed to return to the study 
site as soon as possible, but no l ater than 72  hours after the onset of symptoms, for medical 
evaluation and an NP swab. Participants will be contacted by the study site if they have missed 
reporting in the eDiary. If there is no response to an eDiary prompt for 2  consecutive entries, the 
study site staff will contact the participant by telephone. For passive surveillance, participants will 
be instructed to report symptoms of ILI any time from Day  1 through Day  181/EoS. Participants 
in the Phase 2 NH part who manifest protocol -defined ILI ( Section  8.4.6 ) between Day  1 through 
Day 29 will be evaluated by real -time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) 
testing of an NP s pecimen for influenza (and other respiratory pathogens ). An NP swab specimen 
for pathogens, including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2 will be collected any time from Day  1 
through Day  181/EoS if participants have protocol -defined ILI or symptoms suggestive of 
COVID -19 or other upper or lower respiratory infection at the Investigator’s discretion.  
For the Phase 2 Extension part, a study site visit or a consultation (unscheduled study visit) will 
be arranged within 72 hours after the onset of symptoms to colle ct an NP swab sample if 
participants experience symptoms consistent with the US CDC definition of ILI and/or COVID -19 
during the course of the study.  
All participants in the Phase 1/2 part of the study will provide a blood specimen before injection 
on Day  1 and additional blood specimens through the next 6 months  for immunogenicity (on 
Days  8, 29, and 181/EoS). In the Phase  2 NH and Phase 2 Extension parts, all participants will 
provide a blood specimen for immunogenicity assessments before injection on Day  1 and then on 
Day 29. In addition, blood samples from a subset of participants at Days 91 and 181/EoS may be 
used for additional assessments . The Phase 2 Extension part also contains an optional study site 
visit on Day 4 for blood sample collection for po tential biomarker analysis. Furthermore, blood

Confidential  Page 65 samples for safety or other medical concerns may be collected according to the Investigator’s 
judgment at scheduled study site visits during each part of the study.  
Participants may experience AEs that necessi tate an unscheduled visit. There may also be 
situations in which the Investigator asks a participant to report for an unscheduled visit following 
the report of an AE. Additional examinations may be conducted at these visits as necessary to 
ensure the safet y and well -being of participants during the study. Electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs) should be completed for each unscheduled visit.  
The study will be observer -blind as to which investigational product (IP; mRNA -1010 or placebo 
in the Phase  1/2 part ; mRNA -1010 or the active comparator in the Phase 2 NH and Phase  2 
Extension parts) or dose level is administered. Participants will receive the IP by 0.5 -mL IM 
injection on Day  1. All participants, study site staff involved in participant assessment, and 
Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will be blinded to individual dosing assignment until the study 
database is locked and unblinded. Details regarding blinding are provided in Section 9.1 and the 
study Data Blinding Plan. Preparation of IP for administration will be conducted on site by an 
unblinded staff member who has no role in the observation or assessment of study participants.  
Safety monitoring fo r this study will include blinded study team members, inclusive of, at a 
minimum, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, medical monitor of the contract research organization 
(CRO), a blinded IST, and an unblinded Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The study  
team will conduct ongoing blinded safety reviews during the study and will be responsible for 
notifying the IST and DSMB of potential safety signal events or the triggering of pause rules 
(Section  7.1). 
For the initial stage in the Phase 1/2 part of the study, the IST will conduct a blinded review of all 
available safety data after at least 36  participants (9  participants per vaccination group) have 
completed their Day  8 Visit. Vaccination of the remaining participants in the expansion stage will 
continue in each vaccination group  if no pause rules have been met and the safety and tolerability 
are acceptable . Prior to the start of the Phase 2  NH part of  the study, the IST will also conduct a 
blinded review of available safety data from the Phase  1/2 part. Finally, the IST will also conduct 
ad hoc reviews as requested by the study medical monitor and the study team. An independent 
unblinded DSMB will be u sed throughout the conduct of this study. This committee will be 
composed of independent members with relevant therapeutic and/or biostatistical expertise to 
allow for the ongoing unblinded review of safety data from this study population. Safety data will  
be reviewed according to intervals defined in the DSMB charter and will also occur as needed 
when study stopping or pausing criteria are met, or as otherwise requested by the study team and/or 
IST. See Section  11.1.11  for details on the IST and DSMB constituted in this study.

Confidential  Page 66 For the Phase 1/2 part, there is 1 planned IA, which will include safety and immunogenicity data 
of all participants (all vaccination groups) after completion of the Day  29 Visit. For the Phase  2 
NH and Phase 2 Extension parts, an IA of safety ( reactogenic ity and immunogenicity as 
applicable) will be performed after participants have completed the Day  29 Visit for each part  of 
the study . See Section  9.6 for details.  
Immunizations for the Phase 1/2 part of the study are planned during the NH summer and all 
participants will be recommended to receive a licensed 2021 -2022 NH seasonal influenza vaccine 
during their participation in the study after completio n of the Day  29 Visit. Immunizations for the 
Phase  2 NH part of the study are planned during the NH influenza season. Immunizations for the 
Phase 2 Extension part are planned during the NH spring.  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This study is designed as an observer -blind study. In the Phase  1/2 part of the study, participants 
in Vaccination Groups 1 to 3 will receive mRNA -1010 vaccine and those in Vaccination Group  4 
will receive placebo. The placebo will be used for descriptive comparisons of safety and 
immunogenicity. In the Phase  2 NH part, participants in Vaccination Groups 1 to 3 will receive 
mRNA -1010 vaccine and those in Vaccination Group  4 will receive a licensed quadrivalent 
seasonal influenza vaccine in order to assess n oninferior immunogenicity.  In the Phase  2 Extension 
part, participants in Vaccination Groups 1 to 3 will receive mRNA -1010 vaccine and those in 
Vaccination Group  4 will receive a licensed quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine in order to 
compare immunoge nicity.  
In this observer -blind study, all participants, study site staff involved in participant assessment, 
and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will be blinded to participant vaccine allocation. A limited 
number of Sponsor and/or CRO personnel will b e unblinded to conduct safety data analyses for 
the DSMB safety data reviews (as described in the DSMB charter) and perform the IA. Unblinded 
study personnel, who will not participate in any other aspect of the study, will perform IP 
accountability, dose p reparation, and IP administration.  
In the Phase 1/2 part, all participants will provide NP swab samples before the injection on Day  1 
for assessment of asymptomatic infection with respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus 
and SARS -CoV -2, as influenz a or COVID -19 symptoms may confound reactogenicity 
assessments. Furthermore, if a participant experiences an MAAE or any signs or symptoms 
suggesting ILI and/or COVID -19, an additional NP swab sample will be collected to confirm the 
diagnosis via RT -PCR. In the Phase 2 NH and Phase 2 Extension parts, the NP swab samples for 
assessment of infection with respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2, 
will be collected anytime from Day  1 through Day  181/EoS if the participants have 
protocol -defined ILI (Phase 2 NH) or CDC -defined ILI (Phase 2 Extension) or symptoms

Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 67 suggestive of COVID -19 or other upper or lower respiratory infection at the Investigator’s 
discretion. Participants who manifest ILI between Day  1 through Day  29 will be evaluated b y 
RT-PCR testing of an NP specimen for influenza (and other respiratory pathogens). Additionally, 
in all parts of the study, clinical information may be collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical 
case.  
4.3. Choice of Vaccine Dose  
No clinical studies of mRNA -1010 have been completed to date.  
Previous studies of the Sponsor’s mRNA/LNP SM -102 platform have assessed dose levels as high 
as 250  µg for mRNA -1273, a SARS -CoV -2 vaccine ( Jackson et al 2020 , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), and 
mRNA -1893, a Zika vaccine (unpublished data, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). Additionally, doses up to 300  µg 
of the multivalent mRNA -1647, a cytomegalovirus vaccine (unpublished data, NCT03382 405), 
and the multivalent mRNA -1653, a combination vaccine against human metapneumovirus and 
parainfluenza virus type  3 (unpublished data, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), have been tested in Phase  1 studies. 
The vaccines were generally well to lerated at these dose levels.  
The Sponsor has previously evaluated the immunogenicity of 2 mRNA vaccines containing the 
HA glycoprotein from the H10N8 and H7N9 influenza viruses. Although differences in the 
mRNA/LNP platform and the administration schedule  (2 doses were given 3 weeks apart) limit 
extrapolation of the safety data, these mRNA vaccines against H10N8 and H7N9 influenza viruses 
elicited robust humoral immune responses and were well tolerated up to dose levels of 100  µg (for 
each HA type; Feldman et al 2019 ). 
The FIH Phase 1/2 clinical study of mRNA -1010 vaccine will evaluate the immunogenicity of 
mRNA -1010 at proposed total dose levels of 50  µg (12.5  µg/mRNA), 100  µg (25  µg/mRNA), and 
200 µg (50  µg/mRNA), administered as a single IM injection in healthy adults ≥  18 years of age. 
Based on IA results of the Phase 1/2 study, the 200 µg dose of mRNA -1010 di d not meet the 
Sponsor's desired reactogenicity profile. In the Phase 2 NH part of the study, the Sponsor intends 
to test a lower dose level of 25 µg in lieu of 200 µg, keeping the previous dose levels of 50 and 
100 µg unchanged. Thus, t he Phase 2 NH part will evaluate the immunogenicity of mRNA -1010 
at proposed total dose levels of 25  µg (6.25  µg/mRNA), 50  µg (12.5  µg/mRNA), and 100  µg 
(25 µg/mRNA), administered as a single IM injection in medically stable adults ≥  18 years of age.  
Based on IA of the Phase  1/2 study,  vaccination with mRNA -1010 elicited HAI antibodies at all 
dose levels tested . In the Phase 2 Extension part of the study, the Sponsor intends to test lower 
dose levels of 6.25 and 12.5  µg of mRNA -1010, and to keep the Phase  2 NH mRNA -1010 dose 
level of 25 µg and the active comparator unchanged. Thus, the Phase  2 Extension part will evaluate 
the immunogenicity of mRNA -1010 at proposed total dose levels of 6.25, 12.5, and 25  µg, 
administered as a single IM injection in medically stable adults ≥  18 years of age.

technique.  
Further description of the IP and corresponding instructions for the receipt, storage, preparation , 
administration, accountability, and destruction are described in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3.4.  Investigational Product Packaging and Labeling  
The Sponsor will provide the Investigator (via the study site pharmacy) with adequate quantities 
of the IP. Sterile mRNA -1010 for the Phase 1/2 part is packaged in 2R glass vials with a 0.6 -mL 
fill volume and that for the Phase 2 NH and Phase 2 Extension parts is packaged in 2R glass vials 
with a 0.8 -mL fill volume. The IP will have all required labeling per regulations and will be 
supplied to the pharmacy in an unblinded manner. The Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee will supply 
the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP for use as both placebo (Phase 1/2) and diluent for the 
mRNA -1010 vaccine (as applicable) as well as the active c omparator (Phase  2 NH  and Phase  2 
Extension ). The 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP bears a commercial label and does not 
contain study -specific identification.  
The IP will be packaged and labeled in accordance with the standard operating procedures of t he 
Sponsor or of its designee, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title  21 Good Manufacturing 
Practice guidelines, International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines, guidelines for Quality System Regulations, and applicab le regulations.  
6.3.5.  Investigational Product Storage  
mRNA -1010 must be stored at -60°C to -90°C ( -76°F to -130°F) in a secure area with limited 
access and must be protected from moisture and light until it is prepared for administration 
(Section  6.3.1 ). The freezer should have automated temperature recording and a 24 -hour alert 
system in place that allows for rapid response in case of freezer malfunction.  There must be an 
available backup freezer. The freezer must be connected to a backup generator. In addition, for IP 
accountability, staff are required to keep a temperature log to establish a record of compliance with 
these storage conditions. The study s ite is responsible for reporting any IP that was not temperature 
controlled during shipment or storage. Such IP will be retained for inspection by the monitor and 
disposed of according to approved methods.  
The 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection USP should be s tored at 20 °C to 25 °C (68 °F to 77 °F) in a 
restricted access area.

6.3.6.  Investigational Product Accountability  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the IP accountability staff maintain accurate 
records in an IP accountability log of receipt of all IPs, site IP inventory, IP dispensing, IP 
injections, and return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of used and unused IP vials.  
A site monitor will review the inventory and accountability log during site visits and at completion 
of the study. Additional details are provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
6.3.7.  Investigational Product Handling and Disposal  
A site monitor will reconcile  the IP inventory during study conduct and at EoS for compliance. 
Once fully reconciled at the site at EoS, unused IP will be destroyed onsite or, if necessary, returned 
to the sending depot for destruction.  
6.4. Investigational Product Compliance  
The IP will b e administered at the study site under direct observation of medically qualified study 
staff, and IP administration will be appropriately recorded (date and time) in the eCRF. Qualified 
staff will confirm that the participant has received the entire dose o f the IP. If a participant does 
not receive the IP, the reason for the missed dose will be recorded. Data will be reconciled with 
site accountability records to assess compliance.  
The study site staff are responsible for ensuring that participants comply w ith the allowed study 
visit windows. If a participant misses a visit, every effort should be made to contact the participant 
and complete a visit within the defined visit window specified in the SoE (Table  1, Table  2, and 
Table 3). If a participant does not complete a visit within the time window, that vi sit will be 
classified as a missed visit and the participant will continue with subsequent scheduled study visits. 
All safety requirements of the missed visit will be captured and included in the subsequent visit.

symptoms in anticipation of an injection reaction) will be recorded as such.  
• Systemic steroids (≥ 10  mg/day of prednisone or equivalent ), immunosuppressants, 
immune -modifying drugs, immunogl obulins, and/or blood products administered at 
any time during the study period after the IP injection.  
• Any concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE, AESI, or an 
MAAE from Day  1 through Day  181/EoS.  
• The participant will be asked i n the eDiary if they have taken any antipyretic or 
analgesic to treat or prevent fever or pain within 7  days after the study vaccination, 
including the day of injection. Reported antipyretic or analgesic medications should 
be recorded in the source documen t by the study site staff during the study visits after 
vaccination or via other participant interactions (eg, telephone calls).  
Concomitant medications (including vaccinations) will be coded using the WHODrug Global.  
If a participant takes a prohibited dr ug therapy, the Investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor 
will make a joint decision about continuing or withholding the study vaccination of the participant 
based on the time the medication was administered, the drug’s pharmacology and 
pharmacokinetics, and whether use of the medication will compromise the participant’s safety or 
interpretation of the data. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that details regarding the 
concomitant medications are adequately recorded in the eCRF.

Participant From Per-Protocol Analyses 
The use of the following concomitant medications and/or vaccines will not require withdrawal of 
the participant from the study but may determine a participant’s evaluability in the Per -Protocol 
(PP) analysis (see Table  14 for definition of PP Set):  
• Any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the IP used 
during the study period.  
• Immunosuppressants or other immune -modifying drugs administered chronically (ie, 
more than 14  days in total) during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean 
that ≥  10 mg/day of predni sone or equivalent is not permitted. Inhaled, nasal, and 
topical steroids are allowed.  
• Long -acting immune -modifying drugs administered at any time during the study 
period (eg, infliximab).  
• An authorized or licensed vaccine administered within 28  days after  the study 
vaccination, except for any authorized or approved COVID -19 vaccine that was 
administered more than 14  days before or after the study vaccination (exclusion 
criterion  No. 11; Section  5.1.2 ). 
• Immunoglobulins and/or any blood products administered during the study period.

7.1. Pause Rules  
Study pause rules will be continuously monitored during all periods of the study by the 
Investigators, IST, and DSMB (as warranted). If the Investigator, IST, or DSMB request that the 
study be paused due to a safety concern, further study vaccination in the affected vaccination group 
and at higher dose levels will be suspended, but all other planned procedures relating to safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity assessments will c ontinue as described in the protocol. The 
Sponsor will notify the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research within 48  hours in the event 
of a study pause.

Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
During the Phase 1/2 part of the study, the occurrence of any of the events listed in Table  10 
regardless of the vaccination group, will result in immediate suspension of dosing and enrollment 
in the vaccination group and at higher dose levels. An unscheduled DSMB will be convened to 
assess specific data concerns and to make recommendation s.

the total number of participants in the denominator.  
c Grading of laboratory parameters will be based on the US FDA Guidance for Industry “Toxicity grading scale for healthy adult 
and adolescent volunteer s enrolled in preventive vaccine clinical trials” ( DHHS  2007b ). 
If a pause is triggered in the study, each participant’s study site visits will continue until EoS. If a 
pause affects a participant’s vaccination visit, the window for that participant’s vaccination visit 
will be suspended until the pause is lifted and vaccination can resume. Once the pause is lifted, 
vaccination should be reinstated as soon as possible.  
If a participant is in the screening period for more tha n 28  days as the result of a pause, the 
participant may be rescreened for study eligibility (and will receive a new screening number) as 
long as the participant continues to provide consent to participate in the study.

Abbreviations: AR = adverse reaction; SAE = serious adverse event.  
7.2. Criteria for Delay or Withholding of Study Vaccination  
Body temperature must be measured at the dosing visit before vaccine administration. The 
following events const itute criteria for delay of injection, and if either of these events occur at the 
time scheduled for dosing, the participant may be injected at a later date within the time window 
specified in the SoE ( Table  1, Table  2, and Table 3): 
• Acute moderate or severe infection with or without fever at the time of dosing.  
• Fever, defined as body temperature ≥  38.0°C (100.4°F) at the time of dosing.  
• Receipt of COVID -19 vaccination within 7 to 14 days of planned Day 1.  
Participants with a minor illness without fever, as assessed by the Investigator, can be vaccinated. 
Participants with a fever ≥  38.0°C (100.4°F) will be contacted within the time window acceptable 
for participation and reevaluated for eligi bility. If the Investigator determines that the participant’s 
health on the day of dosing temporarily precludes injection, the visit should be rescheduled within 
the allowed interval for that visit.  
The Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor’s medical monitor, may withhold the IP 
injection if the participant meets any of the following criteria:  
• Becomes pregnant.  
• Develops symptoms or conditions listed in the exclusion criteria.  
• Experiences a clinically significant change in clinical laboratory te st results, vital sign 
measurements, or general condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, requires 
withholding of vaccine.

Confidential  Page 88 The reason(s) for withholding the injection will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy , the Investigator could delay the IP injection within 
the visit window or withhold the IP injection based on a joint decision of the Investigator and the 
CRO’s medical monitor ( Section  6.5.3 ). 
7.3. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Study  
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced unless otherwise 
stated in the protocol.  
A “withdrawal” from the study refe rs to a situation wherein a participant does not return for the 
final visit planned in the protocol.  
Participants can withdraw consent and withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to receive. The Investigator will 
request that the participant complete all study procedures pending at the time of withdrawal.  
If a participant desires to withdraw from the study because of an AE, the Investigator will attempt 
to obtain agreement to follo w-up with the participant until the event is considered resolved or 
stable and will then complete the EoS section of the eCRF.  
Information related to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The Investigator will 
document whether the decision to with draw a participant from the study was made by the 
participant or by the Investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was 
responsible for withdrawal:  
• AE (specify)  
• SAE (specify)  
• Solicited AR or reactogenicity event (specify)  
• Death  
• Lost to  follow -up (LTFU)  
• Physician decision (specify)  
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol deviation  
• Study terminated by Sponsor  
• Withdrawal of consent by participant (specify)  
• Other (specify)

Confidential  Page 89 Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs (including SAEs, solicited ARs, 
or reactogenicity events) must be clearly distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for 
other reasons. Investigators will follow -up with participants who are withdrawn from the study as 
a result of an AE, SAE, solicited AR, or reactogenicity e vent until resolution of the event.  
A participant withdrawing from the study may request destruction of any samples taken and not 
tested, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records.  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure  of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent ( Section  11.1.6 ). 
The Sp onsor will continue to retain and use all research results that have already been collected 
for the study evaluation, unless the participant has requested destruction of these samples. All 
biological samples that have already been collected may be retained  and analyzed at a later date 
(or as permitted by local regulations).  
7.4. Lost to Follow -Up 
A participant  will be considered LTFU if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits 
without stating an intention to withdraw consent and is unable to be contacted by the study site. 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the study site for a required 
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible, counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule, and ascertain whether the  participant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed LTFU, the Investigator or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified le tter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts (eg, dates of telephone calls and 
registered letters) should be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
• A participant who continues to be unre achable or continues to be noncompliant with 
study visits or procedures will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.  
• A participant should not be considered LTFU until due diligence has been completed.

Confidential  Page 90 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
Before performing any study procedures, all potential participants will sign an informed consent 
form (ICF; Section 11.1.6 ). Participants will unde rgo study procedures at the time points specified 
in the SoE ( Table  1, Table  2, and Table 3). A participant can also be seen for an unscheduled visit 
at any time during the study. Reasons for an unscheduled visit may include, but are not limited to, 
reactogenicity issues, symptoms of potential ILI, and/or COVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. The 
site also has the discretion to make reminder telephone calls or send text messages to inform the 
participa nt about visits, review eDiary requirements, or follow -up on ongoing or outstanding 
issues.  
In accordance with “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during 
COVID -19 Public Health Emergency” ( DHHS 2020 ), Investigators may convert study site visits 
to home visits or telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor. Such action should be taken 
to protect the safety and well -being of participants and study site staff or to comply with state or 
municipal mandates.  
General considerations for study assessments and procedures include the following:  
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. The study procedures and their 
timing must be followed as presented in the SoE (Table  1, Table  2, and Table 3). 
Adherence to the study design requirements is essential and required for study 
conduct.  
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awarenes s to determine if the participant should continue participation 
in the study.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log 
to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• The Screening Visit and Day 1 Visit cannot be completed on the same day for the 
Phase 1/2 part but may be completed on the same da y for the Phase 2 NH and Phase  2 
Extension parts. Additionally, the Screening Visit may be performed over multiple 
visits if within the 28 -day screening window.

Confidential  Page 91 8.1. Safety Assessments and Procedures  
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of t he following for each participant, 
according to the SoE (Table  1, Table  2, and Table 3): 
• Solicited local and systemic ARs ( Section 8.4.3 ) that occur during the 7  days 
following vaccine administration (ie, the day of injection and 6  subsequent days). 
Solicited ARs will be recorded daily using eDiaries ( Section 8.1.1 ). 
• Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28  days following vaccine 
administration (ie, the day of injection and 27 subsequent days). Unsolicited AEs are 
defined in Section  8.4.1 . 
• AEs leading to discontinuation from study participation from Day  1 through 
Day 181/EoS or withdrawal from the study.  
• MAAEs from Day 1 through Day 181/EoS or withdrawal from the study . 
• SAEs and AESIs from Day 1 through Day 181/EoS or withdrawal from the study.  
• Results of safety laboratory tests (Phase 1/2 only; Section 8.1.3 ). 
• Vital sign measurements ( Section 8.1.4 ). 
• Physical examination findings ( Section 8.1.5 ). 
• Assessments for causes of respiratory infections as needed from Day 1 through 
Day 181/EoS in the Phase 1/2 and Phase  2 Extension parts of the study or withdrawal 
from the study ( Section  8.1.6 ). Active and passive surveillance for ILI (and 
assessments for causes of respiratory infecti ons as needed) will be conducted from 
Day 1 through Day  181/EoS in the Phase  2 NH part of the study.  
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the study 
vaccination on Day 1 and until the end of their participation in the st udy 
(Section  8.4.8 ). 
• Optional blood sample collection on Day 4 in the Phase 2 Extension part.  
8.1.1.  Use of Electronic Diaries  
At the time of consent, the participants must confirm they will be willing to complete an eDiary 
using either an application downloaded to their own device or using a device that is provided at 
the time of enrollment. Before enrollment on Day  1, the participants will be instructed to  download 
the eDiary application or will be provided an eDiary device to record solicited ARs ( Section  8.4.3 ). 
Participants in the Phase 2 NH part of the study will also use the eDiary to record any ILI symptoms 
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 92 (as part of active and passive surveillance) that they experience after vaccination from Day  1 
through Day  181/EoS.  
Participants will be instructed on Day 1 on thermometer usage to measure bo dy temperature, ruler 
usage to measure injection site erythema and swelling/induration (hardness), and self -assessment 
for localized axillary swelling or tenderness on the same side as the injection arm.  
Participants will record data into the eDiary starti ng approximately 1  hour after injection under 
supervision of the study site staff to ensure successful entry of assessments. The study site staff 
will perform any retraining as necessary. Participants will continue to record data in the eDiary 
after they l eave the study site, preferably in the evening and at the same time each day, on the day 
of injection, and for 6 days following injection.  
Participants will record the following data in the eDiary:  
• Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity ARs, as define d in Section  8.4.3 , that 
occur on the day of IP administration and during the 7  days after the IP administration 
(ie, the day of injection and 6 su bsequent days). Any solicited AR that continues 
beyond Day  7 will be reported in the eDiary until it is no longer reported but only 
until 28 days after vaccination. Adverse reactions recorded in the eDiary beyond 
Day 7 should be reviewed by the study site staff either during the next scheduled 
telephone call or at the next study site visit.  
• Passive and active surveillance of ILI (Phase 2 NH part only; Section  8.1.6 ). 
Participants will record symptoms of ILI that they may experience anytime from 
Day 1 through Day  181/EoS as part of the passive ILI surveillance. For active ILI 
surveillance, participants will be instructed to report whether ILI symptoms ha ve been 
experienced, 3 to 4 times weekly from Day 1 through Day 29 and twice weekly from 
Day 30 through Day  181/EoS, via eDiary or telephone calls. If symptoms occur, 
participants will be directed to return to the study site as soon as possible, but no lat er 
than 72 hours after the onset of symptoms, for medical evaluation and an NP swab. 
Participants will be contacted by the study site, if they have missed reporting in the 
eDiary. If there is no response to an eDiary prompt for 2  consecutive entries, the 
study site staff will contact the participant by telephone ( Section  8.1.6 ). 
• Daily oral body temperature measurement should be performed at approximately the 
same time each day using the thermometer provided by the study site. If body 
temperature is taken more than once in a given day, only the highest temperature 
reading should be recorded.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 93 • Measurements, as applicable, for solicited local ARs  (injection site erythema and 
swelling/induration) will be performed using the ruler provided by the study site.  
• Any medications taken to treat or prevent pain or fever on the day of injection or for 
the next 6  days.  
The eDiary will be the only source docu ment allowed for solicited systemic or local ARs 
(including body temperature measurements). Participants will be instructed to complete eDiary 
entries daily. Quantitative temperature recordings and measurement of any injection site erythema 
or swelling/ind uration reported on the following day may be excluded from the analyses of 
solicited ARs.  
Study site staff will review eDiary data with participants at a visit 7  days after the injection.  
8.1.1.1.  Ancillary Supplies for Participant Use  
Study sites will distribute S ponsor -provided oral thermometers and rulers for use by participants 
in assessing body temperature and injection site reactions, for recording solicited ARs in eDiaries. 
Based on availability, smartphone devices may be provided to those participants who do  not have 
their own device to use for eDiary activities.  
8.1.2.  Safety Telephone Calls  
A safety telephone call is a telephone call made to the participant by trained site personnel. This 
call will follow a script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant safety information. Safety 
telephone calls follow a schedule for each participant, as shown in the SoE (Table  1, Table  2, and 
Table 3). The participant will be interviewed according to the script about occurrence of AEs, 
MAAEs, SAEs, AESIs, AEs leading to withdrawal from study participation, concomitant 
medications associate d with those events, and any nonstudy vaccinations ( Section 8.4.9 ). All 
safety information collected from the telephone contact must be documented  in source documents 
as described by the participant and not documented on the script used for the safety telephone 
contact. An unscheduled follow -up safety call may be triggered if an eDiary record results in 
identification of a relevant safety event.  
8.1.3.  Safety Laboratory Assessments  
In the Phase 1/2 part of the study, planned blood sampling for safety laboratory assessments will 
occur as indicated in the SoE ( Table  1). Tests will include WBC count, hemoglobin, platelets, 
ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine. Laboratory tests will be performed 
by the central laboratory, unless otherwise specified.  
Pregnancy testing (applicable for all parts of the study) include the following:  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 94 • A point -of-care urine pregnancy test will be performed at the Screening Visit and 
before the study vaccination on Day 1. At any time, a pregnancy test either via blood 
or point -of-care urine can be performed, at the discretion of the Investigator.  
• If not documented in a female participant’s medical records, an FSH test may be 
performed at the Screening Visit, as necessary and at the discretion of the 
Investigator, to confirm postmenopausal status.  
No scheduled safety laboratory assessments (except for pregnancy testing) will be conducted in 
the Phase  2 NH or Phase  2 Extension parts of the study.  
8.1.4.  Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, and 
body temperature (preferred route is oral). The participant will be seated for at least 5  minutes 
before all measurements are taken. Vital signs will be measured at the time points indicated in the 
SoE (Table  1, Table  2, and Table 3). On the day of IP administration, vital sign measurements will 
be collected once before injection and approximately 1 hour after injection (before participants are 
discharged from the study site). Vital signs may be collected at other study visits in conjunction 
with a symptom -directed physical examination.  
If any of the vital sign measurements meet the toxicity grading criteria for clinical abnormalities 
of Grade  3 or greater, the abnormal value and grade will be doc umented in the AE section of the 
eCRF (unless there is another known cause of the abnormality that would result in an AE 
classification). The Investigator will continue to monitor the participant with additional 
assessments until the vital sign value has r eached the reference range, returns to the vital sign value 
at baseline, is considered stable, or until the Investigator determines that follow -up is no longer 
medically necessary.  
Febrile participants on the day of IP administration (fever is defined as a  body temperature 
≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F) may be rescheduled within the relevant window periods. Afebrile participants 
with minor illnesses may be injected at the discretion of the Investigator.  
When procedures overlap and are scheduled to occur at the same time  point, the order of 
procedures should be vital sign measurements and then blood collection.  
8.1.5.  Physical Examinations  
A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at scheduled time 
points as indicated in the SoE (Table  1, Table  2, and Table 3). The full examination will include 
assessment of skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, cardiovascular 
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022

Confidential  Page 95 system, abdomen, lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal system and  extremities. Any clinically 
significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as an MAAE.  
Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other time points at the discretion 
of the Investigator. On the day of vaccination, p rior to injection, both arms and associated lymph 
nodes should be examined, and any abnormalities should be documented . 
Body mass index will be calculated at the Screening Visit only.  
8.1.6.  Assessments for Respiratory Viral Infections  
Due to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, participants may get infected with SARS -CoV -2 or 
experience symptoms consistent with ILI during the study.  
Phase 1/2  
All participants will provide NP swab samples before the injection on Day 1 for assessment of 
asymptomatic infection with respir atory pathogens, including influenza virus and SARS -CoV -2, 
as influenza or COVID -19 symptoms may confound reactogenicity assessment ( CDC  2020b ). 
A study site visit or a consultation will be arranged within 24  hours or as soon as  possible to collect 
an NP swab sample if a participant experiences symptoms consistent with the CDC definition of 
ILI (see Section  8.4.6  for definition) and/or COVID -19 during the course of the study. The NP 
swab sample will be tested by multiplex RT -PCR for respiratory pathogens, including influenza 
viruses and SARS -CoV -2. Add itionally, clinical information may be collected to evaluate the 
severity of the clinical case. All findings will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If scheduled, a study site illness visit may include additional assessments such as medical history, 
physical examina tion, and blood sampling for clinical laboratory testing. Radiologic imaging 
studies may be conducted. Blood samples will be collected for potential future immunologic 
assessment of influenza and/or SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
If participants are confirmed to ha ve SARS -CoV -2 infection during the study and are 
asymptomatic, the Investigator will notify the participant's primary care physician and local health 
authority, per local regulations. If the participant had known exposure to COVID -19 (eg, exposure 
to someo ne with a confirmed case of COVID -19) prior to Day 1, it will be captured on the 
COVID -19 exposure form, and the IP administration for that participant will be delayed for at least 
14 days.  
All cases of RT -PCR -confirmed ILI and/or COVID -19 should be captur ed as MAAEs (unless the 
definition for an SAE is met) along with relevant concomitant medications and details about 
severity, seriousness, and outcome.

Confidential  Page 96 Phase 2 Northern Hemisphere  
Participants in the Phase 2 NH part who manifest protocol -defined ILI (see Section  8.4.6  for 
definition ) between Day  1 through Day  29 will be evaluated by real -time RT -PCR testing of an 
NP specimen for influenza (and other respiratory pathogens).  
Both active and passive surveillance for ILI (see Section  8.4.6  for ILI definitions) will be 
conducted between Day 1 through Day  181/EoS. For active surveillance, participants will be 
instructed to report whether ILI symptoms have been experienced, 3 to 4 times weekly from Day  1 
through Day  29, and twice weekly from Day  30 through Day  181/EoS, via eDiary or telephone 
calls.  
If symptoms occur, participants will be directed to return to the study site as soon as possible, but 
no later than 72 hours after the onset of symptoms, for medical evaluation and an NP swab. 
Participants will be conta cted by the study site, if they have missed reporting in the eDiary. If there 
is no response to an eDiary prompt for 2  consecutive entries, the study site staff will contact the 
study participant by telephone. For passive surveillance, participants will be  instructed to report 
symptoms of ILI any time from Day  1 through Day  181/EoS.  
Participants who manifest protocol -defined ILI (see Section  8.4.6  for definition ) will have a study 
site visit or a consultation (unscheduled study visit) arranged within 72 hours after the onset of 
symptoms to collect an NP swab sample if participants experience symptoms consistent with the 
US CDC definition of ILI and/or C OVID -19 during the course of the study.  
Phase 2 Extension  
For the Phase  2 Extension part, a study site visit or a consultation (unscheduled study visit) will 
be arranged within 72  hours after the onset of symptoms to collect an NP swab sample if 
participan ts experience symptoms consistent with the US CDC definition of ILI and/or COVID -19 
during the course of the study.  
8.2. Immunogenicity Assessments  
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments will be collected at the time points indicated in 
the SoE (Table  1, Table  2, and Table 3). The following assessments are planned:  
• Serum antibody level as measured by HAI assay (primary, secondary, and 
exploratory endpoints).  
• Serum neutralizing antibody level as  measured by microneutralization assay or 
similar method (secondary [Phase 1/2 part only] and exploratory endpoints).  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 97 • Cellular immunogenicity, in a subset of participants  (Phase 1/2 cohort only) , as 
assessed by flow cytometry/intracellular cytokine stainin g and/or enzyme -linked 
immune absorbent spot (exploratory endpoint).  
Sample aliquots will be designed to ensure that backup samples are available and that vial volumes 
are likely to be adequate for future testing needs. The actual time and date of each sam ple collected 
will be recorded in the eCRF, and unique sample identification will be utilized to maintain the 
blind at the laboratory at all times and to allow for automated sample tracking and housing. 
Handling and preparation of the samples for analysis,  as well as shipping and storage requirements, 
will be provided in a separate study manual.  
Measurement of antibody levels will be performed in a laboratory designated by the Sponsor.  
According to the ICF ( Section 11.1.6 ), serum from immunogenicity testing may be used for future 
research, which may be performed at the discretion of the Sponsor to further char acterize the 
immune response to influenza viruses, additional assay development, and the immune response 
across influenza viruses.  
The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study, 
including any extra assessments t hat may be required, will not exceed blood limits specified by 
local regulations. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical 
issues with the samples. Further details are provided in both the ICF and Laboratory Reference 
Manual.  
8.3. Efficacy Assessments  
While the study will not be powered for efficacy assessments, ILI will be tracked as an exploratory 
objective in the Phase 1/2, Phase 2 NH, and Phase 2 Extension parts of the study. Active and 
passive surveillance for influenza  will be performed and assessed as part of an exploratory 
objective in the Phase 2  NH part.  
8.4. Safety Definitions and Related Procedures  
8.4.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug/vaccine 
in humans, whe ther or not considered related to the drug/vaccine.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 98 Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition, including an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition, after the IP injection.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after the IP injection even though they may 
have been present before the start of the study.  
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Procedures planned before study entry (eg, hospitalization for preplanned surg ical 
procedure).  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure should be the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
An AR is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine caused the AE 
(Section  8.4.3 ). For the purposes of IND safety reporti ng, “reasonable possibility” means that there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the vaccine and the AE.  
An unsolicited AE is any AE reported by the participant that is not specified as a solicited AR in 
the protocol or is specified as a solicited AR but starts outside the protocol -defined period for 
reporting solicited ARs (ie, 7 days after vaccine administration).  
8.4.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
An AE (including an AR) is considered an SAE if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the Investigator 
during the protocol -defined follow -up period must be reported to the Sponsor, 
whether or not it is considered related t o the IP.  
• Is life -threatening  
An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator or the 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe  form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, inpatient hospitalization indicates the participant was admitted to the 
hospital or emergency ward for at least 1 overnight stay for observati on and/or 
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 99 treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient 
setting. The hospital or emergency ward admission should be considered an SAE 
regardless of whether opinions differ as to the necessity of the admission. 
Compl ications that occur during inpatient hospitalization will be recorded as AEs; 
however, if a complication/AE prolongs hospitalization or otherwise fulfills SAE 
criteria, the complication/AE will be recorded as a separate SAE.  
• Persistent or significant incap acity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal  life functions  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accide ntal trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Medically important event  
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whethe r SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize 
the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to preven t 1 of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered 
serious. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
8.4.3.  Solicited Adverse Reactions  
The term “reactogenicity” refers to the occurrence and intensity of selected signs and symptoms 
(ARs) occurring after the IP injection. The eDiary will solicit daily participant reporting of ARs 
using a structured checklist ( Section  8.1.1 ). Participants will record such occurrences in an eDiary 
on the day of injection and for the 6  days after the day of injection.  
Severity grading of reactogenicity will occur automatically based on participant entries into the 
eDiary according to the grading scales presented i n Table  13, which are modified from the toxicity 
grading scale for healthy adult and adolescent volunteers enrolled in preventive vaccine clinica l 
trials ( DHHS 2007b ). 
If a participant reported a solicited AR during the solicited period and did not record the event in 
the eDiary, the event should be recorded on the Reactogenicity page of the eCRF.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 100 If the event starts du ring the solicited period, but continues beyond 7  days after dosing, the 
participant should notify the site to provide an end date to close out the event on the Reactogenicity 
page of the eCRF.  
If the participant reported an event after the solicited perio d (ie, after Day  7), it should be recorded 
as an AE on the AE page of the eCRF.  
All solicited ARs (local and systemic) will be considered causally related to study vaccination.

Abbreviations: AE = adverse event; eCRF = electronic case report form,  
Note: Events listed above but starting > 7 days post study injection will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. Causality for 
each event will be determined per assessment by the Investigator.  
Any solicited AR that meets any of the following criteria must be entered into the participant’s 
source document and must also be recorded by the study site staff in the solicited AR section of 
the participant’s eCRF:  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that results in a visit to a healthcare practitioner 
(HCP), to be recorded as an MAAE ( Section  8.4.4 ). 
• Solicited local or systemic AR leading to the participant withdrawing from the study 
or the participant being withdrawn from the study by the Investigator (AE leading to 
withdrawal).  
• Solicited local or systemic AR lastin g beyond 7 days after injection.  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that otherwise meets the definition of an SAE.  
8.4.4.  Medically Attended Adverse Events  
An MAAE is an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit to an HCP. This would include visits to a 
study site for un scheduled assessments (eg, abnormal laboratory follow -up, and/or COVID -19 
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 102 [Section  8.1.6 ]) and visits to HCPs external to the study site (eg, urgen t care, primary care 
physician). Investigators will review unsolicited AEs for the occurrence of any MAAEs. 
Unsolicited AEs will be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF.  
All cases of RT -PCR -confirmed ILI and/or confirmed COVID -19 will be recorded as MAAE s. 
8.4.5.  Anaphylaxis  
All suspected cases of anaphylaxis should be recorded as MAAEs and reported as an SAE, based 
on the criteria for a medically important event, unless the event meets other serious criteria. As an 
SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all circumstances 
within 24  hours, per Section  8.4.13 . The Investigator will submit any updated anaphylaxis case 
data to the Spo nsor within 24 hours of it being available. For reporting purposes, a participant who 
displays signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (as described below) should be reported 
as a potential case of anaphylaxis. This is provided as general guidance fo r Investigators and is 
based on the Brighton Collaboration case definition ( Rüggeberg et al 2007 ). 
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitivity reaction with multi -organ system involvement that can 
present as, or rapidly progress t o, a severe life -threatening reaction. It may occur following 
exposure to allergens from a variety of sources.  
Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome characterized by the following:  
• Sudden onset AND  
• Rapid progression of signs and symptoms AND  
• Involves 2 or more organ systems, as follows:  
− Skin/mucosal:  urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, angioedema, generalized 
pruritus with skin rash, generalized prickle sensation, red and itchy eyes.  
− Cardiovascular:  measured hypotension, clinical diagnosis of uncompens ated shock, 
loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, evidence of reduced 
peripheral circulation.  
− Respiratory:  bilateral wheeze (bronchospasm), difficulty breathing, stridor, upper 
airway swelling (lip, tongue, throat, uvula, or larynx), r espiratory distress, persistent 
dry cough, hoarse voice, sensation of throat closure, sneezing, rhinorrhea.  
− Gastrointestinal:  diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.

Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 103 8.4.6.  Influenza -Like Illness  
A protocol -defined ILI is determined by the occurrence of at le ast 1 respiratory illness symptom 
concurrently with at least 1  systemic symptom, or the occurrence of any 2 or more respiratory 
symptoms.  
Respiratory Symptoms  Systemic Symptoms  
1. Sore throat  
2. Cough/rhinorrhea/nasal congestion (≥  1 of 
the 3 symptoms count as 1 respiratory 
symptom)  
3. Sputum production  
4. Wheezing  
5. Difficulty breathing  1. Body temperature >  37.2°C (>  99°F)  
2. Chills  
3. Tiredness  
4. Headache  
5. Myalgia  
6. Nausea/Vomiting  
7. Diarrhea  
A CDC -defined ILI is defined as body temperature ≥  37.8°C (100°F) accompanied by cough 
and/or sore throat.  
An RT -PCR -confirmed ILI is defined as a positive influenza result by RT -PCR done at any setting 
during the study period.  
8.4.7.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern speci fic to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the 
Investigator to the Sponsor are required. Such events may require further investigation to 
characterize and understand them.  
Adverse events of special i nterest for this protocol are listed in Appendix 3 ( Section  11.3). 
All AESIs will be collected through the entire study period and must be reported to the Sponsor or 
designee immediately and in all circumstances within 24  hours of becoming aware of the event via 
the electronic data capture (EDC) system. If a site receives a report of a new AESI from a 
participant or receives updated information on a p reviously reported AESI at a time after the eCRF 
has been taken offline, then the site can report this information on a paper AESI form using the 
SAE Mailbox.  
Myocarditis/Pericarditis  
A case of suspected, probable, or confirmed myocarditis, pericarditis, o r myopericarditis should 
be reported as an AESI, even if it does not meet criteria per the CDC case definition. The event 
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 104 should also be reported as an SAE if it meets seriousness criteria ( Section 8.4.2 ). The CDC case 
definition is provided in Section  11.4 as guidance.  
8.4.8.  Recording and Follow -Up of Pr egnancy  
Female participants who have a positive pregnancy test at screening should not be enrolled; 
participants who have a positive pregnancy test at Day 1 should not receive the IP.  
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the study vaccination on 
Day 1 and until the end of their participation in the study. If a pregnancy is reported, the 
Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24  hours of learning of the pregnancy and should 
follow the procedures outlined in thi s section. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous 
abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
Pregnancies occurring in participants after enrollment must be reported to Sponsor or designee 
within 2 4 hours of the site learning of its occurrence, using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or 
the SAE Fax line ( Section  8.4.13 ). If the participant a grees to submit this information, the 
pregnancy must be followed to determine the outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. This follow -up should occur even if 
intended duration of the safety follow -up for the study has ended. Pregnancy report forms will be 
distributed to the study site to be used for this purpose. The Investigator must immediately (withi n 
24 hours of awareness) report to the Sponsor any pregnancy resulting in an abnormal outcome 
according to the procedures described for SAEs.  
8.4.9.  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are re corded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor.  
Solicited ARs will be collected from Day 1 through 7 days after the vaccine dose. Other 
(unsolicited) AEs will be collected from Day 1 through 28 days after the vaccine dose.  
The MAAEs, SAEs, and AESIs will b e collected from participants as specified in the SoE (Table  1, 
Table  2, and Table 3) until the end of their participation in the study. Any AEs occurring before  
receipt of the IP will be analyzed separately from AEs.  
At every study site visit or telephone contact, participants will be asked a standard question to 
elicit any medically related changes in their well -being (including respiratory viral infection 
sympt oms) according to the scripts provided. Participants will also be asked if they have been 
hospitalized, had any accidents, used any new medications, changed concomitant medication 
regimens (both prescription and over -the-counter medications), or had any no nstudy vaccinations.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 105 In addition to participant observations, physical examination findings and other documents 
relevant to participant safety classified as an AE will be documented in the AE section of the 
eCRF.  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Invest igator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and 
followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is LTFU 
(as defined in Section  7.4). 
8.4.10.  Assessment of Intensity  
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described 
in the definition of an SAE ( Section  8.4.2 ), NOT when it is rated as severe.  
The severity (or intensity) of an AR or AE refers to the ext ent to which it affects the participant’s 
daily activities. The toxicity grading scale for healthy adult and adolescent volunteers enrolled in 
preventive vaccine clinical trials ( DHHS 2007b ) will be used to categorize local and  systemic 
reactogenicity events ( solicited ARs ), clinical laboratory test results, and vital sign measurements 
observed during this study. Specific criteria for local and systemic reactogenicity events are 
presented in Section  8.4.3 . 
The determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs should be made by the Investigator based 
upon medical judgment and the definitions of severity as follows:  
• Mild: These events do not inte rfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate: These events cause some interference with the participant’s daily activities 
and require limited or no medical intervention.  
• Severe: These events prevent the participant’s daily activity and require intensive 
therapeutic intervention.  
Study staff should elicit from the participant the impact of AEs on the participant’s activities of 
daily living to assess severity and document appropriately in the participant’s source 
documentation. Changes in the sev erity of an AE should be documented in the participant’s source 
documentation to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity to be 
performed. An AE characterized as intermittent requires documentation of onset and duration o f 
each episode. An AE that fluctuates in severity during the course of the event is reported once in 
the eCRF at the highest severity observed . 
8.4.11.  Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to the IP is part of the documenta tion process 
but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 106 The Investigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be char acterized using the following 
classification:  
• Not related:  There is not a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. 
Participant did not receive the IP OR the temporal sequence of AE onset relative to 
administration of the IP is not reasonable OR the AE is more likely explained by 
another cause than the IP.  
• Related:  There is a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. There is 
evidence of exposure to the IP. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the 
administration of the IP is  reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by the IP than 
by another cause.  
8.4.12.  Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the study 
regardless of their relationship to the IP or their clinical significance. If there is any doubt as to 
whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.  
All unsolicited AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded in the AE section of 
the eCRF. Information to be collected includes type of event, time of onset, Investigator -specified 
assessment of severity (impact on activities of daily living) and relationship to the IP, time of 
resolution of the event, seriousness, any required treatment or evaluations, and outcome. The 
unsolicited AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to 
concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be 
followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by the I nvestigator to be not clinically 
significant. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all 
unsolicited AEs.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened but does not 
deteriorate sh ould not be reported as an unsolicited AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it should be recorded as an unsolicited AE.  
8.4.13.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
Any AE considered serious by the Investigator or that meets SAE criteria ( Section  8.4.2 ) must be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 24  hours of becoming aware of the SAE) via the EDC 
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 107 system. The Investigator will assess  whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP caused the 
SAE. The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of any SAE 
as outlined in 21  US CFR Parts 312 and 320. The Investigator is responsible for notifying th e 
institutional review board (IRB) directly.  
If the eCRF is unavailable at the time of the SAE, the following contact information is to be used 
for SAE reporting:  
• SAE Mailbox:  
• SAE Hotline (USA):  
• SAE Fax Line (USA):  
Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs are described in Section  8.4.18 . 
The Investigator and any qualified designees are respon sible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE, including SAEs, and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the IP or study procedures, or that caused 
the participant to disc ontinue the  study.  
8.4.14.  Reporting of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The following process for reporting an AESI ensures compliance with 21 CFR 312 and ICH GCP 
guidelines. After learning that a participant has experienced an AESI, the Investigator or designe e 
is responsible for reporting the AESI to the Sponsor, regardless of relationship or expectedness, 
within 24  hours of becoming aware of the event. If the AESI meets the criteria for an SAE, the 
SAE reporting procedure should be followed.  
8.4.15.  Time Period and F requency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse 
Event Information  
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of IP administration but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded in the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section  of the eCRF 
and not in the AE section; however, if the condition worsens at any time during the study, it will 
be recorded and reported as an AE.  
Adverse events may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant.  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint fro m the participant.

Confidential  Page 108 Solicited ARs will be collected from the day of injection through 6  days after the injection. Other 
(unsolicited) AEs will be collected from the day of injection through 2 8 days after the injection.  
Serious AEs will be collected from the start of IP administration until the last day of study 
participation.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via the EDC system. If 
a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a 
previously reported SAE and the  eCRF has been taken offline, then the site can report this 
information on a paper SAE form using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or the SAE Fax line 
(Section  8.4.13 ). 
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE if it 
is determined by the Investigator to be clinically significant (eg, meets any serious criteria). If this 
is the case, it must be reco rded in the source document and as an AE on the appropriate AE form(s). 
The evaluation that produced the value or result should be repeated until that value or result returns 
to normal or is stabilized and the participant’s safety is not at risk.  
Investiga tors are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after EoS. However, if the 
Investigator learns of any SAE (including a death) at any time after a participant has withdrawn 
from or completed the study and the Investigator considers the event to be reaso nably related to 
the IP or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.  
Participants who develop ILI will be followed through 30 days from the onset of ILI even if Day  30 
is beyond Day 181/EoS.  
8.4.16.  Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Electronic diaries have specifically been designed for this study by the Sponsor. The diaries will 
include prelisted AEs (solicited ARs) and intensity scales; they will also include blank space for 
the recording of information on  other AEs (unsolicited AEs) and concomitant 
medications/vaccinations.  
The Investigator is responsible for the documentation of AEs regardless of the vaccination group 
or suspected causal relationship to the IP. For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue an d obtain 
information adequate to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether the AE meets the 
criteria for classification as an SAE, which requires immediate notification to the Sponsor or its 
designated representative.  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.

Confidential  Page 109 8.4.17.  Follow -Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits and contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and followed until resolution, 
stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the particip ant is LTFU, as defined in Section  7.4. 
8.4.18.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the sa fety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRBs, and Investigators.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared  for suspected unexpected serious ARs according to 
local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigators as necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety informati on (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and then file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.5. Safety Monitoring  
The CRO’s medical monitor, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, and the  individual Site Investigators 
will monitor safety throughout the study. The roles of the IST and DSMB are outlined in 
Section  11.1.11 . 
8.6. Treatme nt of Overdose  
Because the IP is to be administered by an HCP, it is unlikely that an overdose will occur. Dose 
deviations will be tracked as protocol deviations ( Section  11.1.8 ). 
8.7. Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 
8.8. Pharmacodynamics  
Pharmacodynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study.

This section summarizes the planned statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. The 
details of statistical analysis will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be 
finalized before the clinical database lo ck for the study. If changes are made to primary and/or key 
secondary objectives or the related statistical methods after the study has begun but prior to any 
data unblinding, then the protocol will be amended (consistent with ICH Guideline E9). Changes 
to other secondary or exploratory analyses made after the protocol has been finalized, along with 
an explanation as to when and why they occurred, will be listed in the SAP or clinical study report 
(CSR) for the study. Ad hoc exploratory analyses, if any, wi ll be clearly identified in the CSR.  
9.1. Blinding and Responsibility for Analyses  
This is an observer -blind study. The Investigator, study staff, study participants, site monitors, and 
Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will be blinded to the IP administered  until the study database 
is locked and unblinded, with the following exceptions:  
• Unblinded personnel (of limited number) will be assigned to vaccine accountability 
procedures and will prepare the IP for all participants. These personnel will have no 
study  functions other than IP management, documentation, accountability, 
preparation, and administration. They will not be involved in participant evaluations 
and will not reveal the identity of the IP to either the participant or the blinded study 
site personn el involved in the conduct of the study unless this information is 
necessary in the case of an emergency.  
• Unblinded medically qualified study site personnel will administer the IP. They will 
not be involved in assessments of any study endpoints.  
• Unblinded site monitors, not involved in other aspects of monitoring, will be assigned 
as the IP accountability monitors. They will have responsibilities to ensure that sites 
are following all proper IP accountability, preparation, and administration procedures.  
• An independent unblinded statistical and programming team will perform the 
preplanned IA ( Section  9.6). Sponsor team members will be prespecified to be 
unblinded to the IA results and will not communicate the results to the blinded 
Investigators, study site staff, clinical monitors, or participants.  
• The DSMB will review the IA data to safeguard the interests of clinical study 
participants and to help ensu re the integrity of the study. The DSMB will review 
unblinded IA results provided by the independent unblinded statistician. The DSMB 
will also review unblinded statistical outputs for ad hoc safety reviews triggered by

Confidential  Page 112 pause rules, should this occur. Section 11.1.11  provides additional information on 
DSMB and safety review.  
The dosing assignment will be concealed by having the unblinded pharmacy pe rsonnel prepare the 
IP in a secure location that is not accessible or visible to other study staff. An opaque sleeve over 
the syringe used for injection will maintain the blind at the time of injection, as the doses containing 
mRNA -1010 will look different  from those of placebo/active comparator. Only delegated 
unblinded study site staff will conduct the injection procedure. Once the injection is completed, 
only the blinded study staff will perform further assessments and interact with the participants. 
Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled at the pharmacy.  
9.1.1.  Breaking the Blind  
Except in the case of medical necessity, a participant’s vaccine assignment should not be unblinded 
without the approval of the Sponsor. If a participant becomes seriously ill or pregnant during the 
study, the blind will be broken only if knowledge of the vaccine assignment will affect that 
participant’s clinical management. In the event of a medical emergency requiring identification of 
individual vaccine assignme nt, the Investigator will make every attempt to contact the CRO’s 
medical monitor, preferably via electronic protocol inquiry platform, to explain the need for 
unblinding within 24 hours of opening the code. The Investigator will be responsible for 
documen ting the time, date, reason for unblinding, and the names of the personnel involved. The 
Investigator (or designee) will have access to unblind participants within interactive response 
technology (IRT). All unblinding instances will be tracked via an audit  trail in IRT and documented 
in the final study report.  
In addition to the aforementioned situations where the blind may be broken, the data will also be 
unblinded to a statistical team at specified time point(s) for analysis as outlined in Section 9.6. 
9.2. Statistical Hypotheses  
No formal hypotheses will be tested.  
9.3. Sample Size Determination  
The sample size for this study is not driven by statistical  assumptions for formal hypothesis testing. 
The number of proposed participants is considered sufficient to provide a descriptive summary of 
the safety and immunogenicity of different dose levels of mRNA -1010.  
Phase 1/2  
Approximately 180 participants will be randomly assigned in this part of the study, with 
approximately 45  participants in each vaccination group. Details regarding the number of 
participants in each vaccination group and the randomization ratio are presented in Section  6.2.1 .

Confidential  Page 113 With 45  participants receiving an investigational vaccine, there is a probability of approximately 
90% to observe at least 1 participant with an AE, if the true inci dence rate of the AE is 5%; if the 
true incidence rate is 10%, then the probability to observe it will be approximately 99%.  
Phase 2 Northern Hemisphere  
Approximately 500 participants will be randomly assigned in a 3:3:3:1 ratio to the mRNA -1010 
25, 50, 10 0 µg groups, or the Active Comparator Group. A total of 450 participants will receive 
the mRNA -1010 vaccine (150 participants at each dose level). A sample size of 150  participants 
at each dose level has at least a 95% probability to observe at least 1 par ticipant with an AE , if the 
true incidence rate is 2%; if the true incidence rate is 3%, then the probably to observe it will be 
99%. 
Phase 2 Extension  
Approximately 200  participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the mRNA -1010 
6.25, 12.5,  25 µg groups, or the Active Comparator Group. A total of 150  participants will receive 
the mRNA -1010 vaccine (50  participants at each dose level). With 50  participants receiving an 
investigational vaccine, there is a probability of approximately 92% to ob serve at least 1 participant 
with an AE, if the true incidence rate of the AE is 5%; if the true incidence rate is 10%, then the 
probability to observe it will be approximately 99%.

9.5.3.  Immunogenicity Analyses  
Immunogenicity analyses in each part of the study will be reported based on the PP Set and 
provided by vaccination group, unless otherwise specified.  
Phase 1/2  
For the immunogenicity endpoints, geometric mean of specific antibody titers with corresponding 
95% CI at each time point and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of specific antibody titers with 
corresponding 95%  CI at each postbaseline time point over preinjection baseline at Day 1 will be 
provided by vaccination group. The 95% CIs will be calculated based on the t -distribution of the 
log 2-transformed values and then back transformed to the original scale. Descriptive summary 
statistics, including median, minimum, and maximum, will also be provided.  
For calculation of geometric mean titers (GMTs), antibody titers reported as below the lower limit 
of quantification (LLOQ) will be replaced by 0.5 × LLOQ. Values that are greater than the upper 
limit of quantification (ULOQ) will be converted to the ULOQ.  
Seroconversion rate from baseline will be provided with a 2 -sided 95% CI using the 
Clopper -Pearson method at each postbaseline time point. Rate of seroconversion is defined as the 
proportion of participants with either a prevaccination HAI titer < 1:10 and a postvaccination HAI 
titer ≥  1:40 or a prevaccination HAI titer ≥ 1:10 and a minimum 4 -fold rise in postvaccination HAI 
antibody titer.

Phase 2 Northern Hemisphere  
Immune responses, as measured by GMT and sero conversion rate in the mRNA -1010 groups 
based on Day 29 HAI titers, will be compared with that of participants receiving active comparator 
for all 4 strains.  
An analysis of covariance model will be carried out with HAI titers at Day 29 as a dependent 
varia ble and a group variable as the fixed variable. The GMT of the mRNA -1010 at Day  29 will 
be estimated by the geometric least square mean (GLSM) from the model. The geometric mean 
ratio (GMTr; ratio of GMT) will be estimated by the ratio of GLSM from the mod el. The 
corresponding 2 -sided 95%  CI will be provided to assess the difference in immune response 
between the mRNA -1010 compared with the active comparator at Day 29.  
The number and percentage of participants with seroconversion due to vaccination will 
be provided with 2 -sided 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson method at Day 29. The 
seroconversion rate difference with 95% CI at Day 29 will be provided.  
In addition, the GMT of HAI titers with corresponding 95% CI will be provided at each time point. 
The 95% CI s will be calculated based on the t -distribution of the log -transformed values and then 
back transformed to the original scale. The GMFR of HAI titers with corresponding 95% CI at 
each postbaseline time point over baseline will be provided. Descriptive sum mary statistics, 
including median, minimum, and maximum, will also be provided.  
For summarizations of GMTs, antibody titers reported as LLOQ will be replaced by 0.5  × LLOQ. 
Values that are greater than ULOQ will be converted to the ULOQ.  
Rate of seroconver sion is defined as  (1) if LLOQ is 1:10 , the proportion of participants with either 
a prevaccination HAI titer < 1:10 and a postvaccination HAI titer ≥ 1:40 or a prevaccination HAI 
titer ≥ 1:10 and a minimum 4 -fold rise in the postvaccination HAI antibody t iter; or (2) if LLOQ 
is greater than 1:10, the proportion of participants with either a prevaccination HAI titer < LLOQ 
and a postvaccination HAI ≥ 4 times of LLOQ, or a prevaccination HAI ≥ LLOQ and a minimum 
4-fold rise in the postvaccination HAI .  
The HAI titers at Day 29, GMTr at Day 29, and the difference in seroconversion rate at Day  29 
may also be performed with the Full Analysis Set as supplementary analyses.  
Phase  2 Extension  
Immune responses, as measured by GMT and seroconversion rate in the mRNA -1010 groups 
based on Day 29 HAI titers, will be compared with that of participants receiving active comparator 
for all 4 strains.

Exploratory analyses not addressed in Section  9.5.3  will be described in the SAP before database 
lock.  
9.5.5.  Subgroup Analyses  
The protocol does not define any formal subgroup analyses, and the study is not adequately 
powered to perform subgroup anal yses.  
9.6. Study Analyses  
A Day 29 IA is planned in this study for the Phase 1/2 , Phase 2 NH , and Phase  2 Extension parts 
separately . The IA for the Phase 1/2 part will be performed after all participants have completed 
the Day  29 Visit. All relevant data to th e IA will be cleaned (ie, data that are as clean as possible).  
For the Phase 2 NH and Phase  2 Extension part s, an IA of safety ( reactogenicity  and 
immunogenicity as applicable) will be performed after participants have completed the Day  29 
Visit  for each  part of the study . All data relevant to the IA through the Day  29 Visit will be cleaned 
(ie, data that are as clean as possible). An interim study report may be generated, in which case a 
formal database lock will be performed to support the interim study  report.  
The IA will be performed by a separate team of unblinded programmers and statisticians. The 
analysis will be presented by vaccination groups. Except for a limited number of Sponsor and CRO 
personnel who will be unblinded to perform the IA, the stu dy site staff, Investigators, study 
monitors, and participants will remain blinded until after the final database lock for final analysis.  
The final analysis of safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity will be performed after all 
participants have comple ted all planned study procedures. The results of this analysis will be 
presented in a final CSR, including individual listings.

• Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines, including the 
Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Med ical 
Sciences International Ethical Guidelines.  
• Applicable ICH GCP guidelines.  
• Applicable laws and regulatory requirements.  
• The protocol, protocol amendments, ICF, IB, and other relevant documents 
(eg, advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB by the Investigator and reviewed 
and approved by the IRB before the study is initiated.  
• Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB approval before implementation of 
changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an 
immediate haza rd to study participants.  
• The Investigator will be responsible for the following:  
− Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB annually or 
more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures 
established by the  IRB.  
− Notifying the IRB of SAEs or other significant safety findings as required by IRB 
procedures.  
− Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to 
requirements of 21 CFR, ICH GCP guidelines, the IRB, and all other applicable 
local regulations.  
11.1.2.  Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational study site can enter a participant into the study, the Sponsor or its 
representatives will visit the study site for the following:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities.  
• Discuss with the Inves tigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives. 
This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between the Sponsor, the 
designated CRO, and the Investigator.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 125 According to ICH GCP guidelines, the Sponsor of the study is responsible for ensuring the proper 
conduct of the study with regard to protocol adherence and validity of data recorded on the eCRFs. 
The study monitor’s duties are to aid the Inve stigator and the Sponsor in the maintenance of 
complete, accurate, legible, well -organized, and easily retrievable data. The study monitor will 
advise the Investigator of the regulatory necessity for study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, 
and inspec tion by providing direct access to the source data and/or documents. In addition, the 
study monitor will explain to and interpret for the Investigator all regulations applicable to the 
clinical evaluation of IP as documented in ICH guidelines.  
It is the st udy monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRFs and source documentation throughout 
the study to protect the rights of the participants; to verify adherence to the protocol; to verify 
completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm ad herence of study conduct 
to any local regulations. Details will be outlined in the clinical monitoring plan. During the study, 
a monitor from the Sponsor or a representative will have regular contacts with the study site, for 
the following purposes:  
• Provid e information and support to the Investigator(s).  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that the data are 
being accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed.  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all origin al records for each 
participant (eg, clinical charts or electronic medical record system).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent . 
• Confirm that AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs, that any 
SAEs have been forwarded to  the SAE Hotline, and that those SAEs that meet criteria 
for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs information 
or advice.  
11.1.3.  Audits and Inspections  
The Sponsor, their  designee(s), the IRB, or regulatory authorities will be allowed to conduct site 
visits to the investigational facilities for the purpose of monitoring or inspecting any aspect of the

at any stage is without any prejudi ce to the participant’s subsequent care.  
The participant must be allowed sufficient time to decide whether they wish to participate.  
The participant must be made aware of and give consent to direct access to his/her source medical 
records by study monitors , auditors, the IRB, and regulatory authorities. The participant should be 
informed that such access will not violate participant confidentiality or any applicable regulations. 
The participant should also be informed that he/she is authorizing such access by signing the ICF.  
A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participant . 
A participant who is rescreened is not required to sign another ICF if the rescreening occurs within 
28 days from the previous ICF signature date (within the initial screening period).  
The ICF will also explain that excess serum from immunogenicity testing may be used for future 
research, which may be performed at the discretion of the Sponsor to further characterize the 
immune response to influenza viruses, for additional assay  development, and to examine the 
immune response across influenza viruses.  
11.1.7.  Protocol Amendments  
No change or amendment to this protocol may be made by the Investigator or the Sponsor after 
the protocol has been agreed to and signed by all parties unless suc h change(s) or amendment(s) 
has (have) been agreed upon by the Investigator or the Sponsor. Any change agreed upon will be 
recorded in writing, and the written amendment will be signed by the Investigator and the Sponsor.

potential be nefit of the study or may affect participant safety, including changes of study 
objectives, study design, participant population, sample sizes, study procedures, or significant 
administrative aspects will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Such am endment will be 
released by the Sponsor, agreed to by the Investigator(s), and approved by the relevant IRB(s) 
prior to implementation. A signed and dated statement that the protocol, any subsequent relevant 
amended documents, and the ICF have been approve d by relevant IRB(s) must be provided to the 
Sponsor before the study is initiated.  
Administrative changes to the protocol are minor corrections and/or clarifications that have no 
effect on the way the study is to be conducted. These administrative changes  will be released by 
the Sponsor and agreed to by the Investigators, and the IRB(s) will be notified.  
11.1.8.  Protocol Deviations  
Noncompliance may be on the part of the participant, the Investigator, or the study site staff. As a 
result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly.  
It is the responsibility of the Site Investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and report 
deviations to the Sponsor or its designee in a timely manner. All deviations must be addr essed in 
study source documents and reported to the study monitor.  Protocol deviations must be sent to the 
reviewing IRB per their policies. The Site Investigator is responsible for knowing and adhering to 
the reviewing IRB requirements.  
11.1.9.  Data Protection  
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. Any participant records or datasets 
that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names or any 
information that would make the participant identifiable will  not be transferred.  
The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be

ModernaTX, Inc.  03 Feb 2022  
Protocol: mRNA -1010 -P101 Amendment  4 mRNA -1010  
 
Confidential  Page 129 Each participant will be asked to complete a form allowing the Investigator to notify the 
participant’s primary HCP of his/her participation in this study.  
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records will be identified in a 
manner desi gned to maintain participant con fidentiality. All records will be kept in a secure 
storage area with limited access. Clinical information will not be released without the written 
permission  of the participant, exce pt as necessary for monitoring and auditing by the Sponsor, 
its designee, the re levant regulatory au thority, or the IRB. 
The Investigator  and all employees and coworkers involved with this study may not disclose or use 
for any  purpose other than performance of the study, any data, record, or other unpublished,  
confidential information disclosed to those individuals for the purpose of the study. Prior written 
agreement from the  Spons or or its designee must be obtained for the disclosure of any confidential 
information to other parties. 
11.1.10.  Sample Retention and Future Biomedical Research  
The Sponsor may store laboratory samples for the time frame specified in the ICF to address study 
objectives or  further scientific questions related to mRNA -1010 or anti -respiratory vir al immune 
response. In addition, identifiable samples can be destroyed at any time at the request of the 
participant. During the study or during the retention period, in addition to the analysis outlined in 
the study endpoints, exploratory analysis may be conducted using other measures of adaptive 
immunity to seasonal influenza to include humoral and cellular immune assay methodologies on 
any remaining blood or serum samples, includin g samples from participants who are screened but 
are not subsequently enrolled. In the Phase 2 NH and Phase  2 Extension parts of the study, these 
analyses will extend the search for other potentially relevant biomarkers to investigate the effect 
of mRNA -1010 as well as to determine how changes in biomarkers may relate to exposure and 
clinical outcomes. A decision to perform such exploratory research may arise from new scientific 
findings related to the vaccine class, as well as reagents for biomarker assay development.  
11.1.11.  Safety Oversight  
Safety monitoring for this study will include the blinded study team members, inclusive of, at a 
minimum, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, CRO’s medical monitor, a blinded IST, and an 
unblinded DSMB. The study team will conduct ongoing blinded safety reviews during the study 
and will be responsible for notifying the IST and DSMB of potential safety signal events or the 
triggering of pause rules.  
The IST will consist of at least 2 Sponsor physicians who will be voting members not directly 
involved in the clinical development of the study. For the initial stage in the Phase 1/2 part of the 
study, the IST will conduct a blinded review of all available safety data after at least 36 participants

Confidential  Page 130 (9 participants per vaccination group; Table  6) have completed their Day  8 Visit. Vaccination of 
the remaining participants in the expansion stage will continue in each vaccination group  if no 
pause rules have been met and the safety and tolerability are acceptable. Prior to the start of the 
Phase  2 NH part of the study, the IST will also conduct a blinded review of available safety data 
from the Phase 1/2 part of the study. Finally, the IST  will also conduct ad  hoc reviews as requested 
by the study medical monitor and the study team.  
An independent unblinded DSMB will be used throughout the conduct of this study. This 
committee will be composed of independent members with relevant therapeuti c and/or 
biostatistical expertise to allow for the ongoing unblinded review of safety data from this study 
population. Safety data will be reviewed according to intervals defined in the DSMB charter and 
will also occur as needed when study stopping or paus ing criteria are met, or as otherwise requested 
by the study team and/or IST.  
Details regarding the IST and DSMB composition, responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of 
data review will be defined in their respective charters.  
11.1.12.  Dissemination of Clinical  Study Data  
The Sponsor shares information about clinical studies and results on publicly accessible websites, 
based on international and local legal and regulatory requirements, and other clinical study 
disclosure commitments established by pharmaceutical  industry associations. These websites 
include clinicaltrials.gov, European Union clinical trial register (eu.ctr), and some national 
registries.  
11.1.13.  Data Quality Assurance and Quality Control

• Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data 
entered into the eCRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and 
verifiable from source docume nts; that the safety and rights of participants are being 
protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently 
approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
• Records and d ocuments, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this 
study must be retained by the Investigator for a period of at least 2 years after the last 
marketing application approval or, if not approved, 2 years following the 
discontinuance of the te st article for investigation. If this requirement differs from any 
local regulations, the local regulations will take precedence unless the local retention 
policy is less than 2 years. No records may be destroyed during the retention period 
without the wri tten approval of the Sponsor. No records may be transferred to another 
location or party without written notification to the Sponsor.  
Quality assurance includes all the planned and systematic actions that are established to ensure 
that the clinical study i s performed, and the data are generated, documented (recorded), and 
reported according to ICH GCP and local/regional regulatory standards.  
A QA representative from the Sponsor or qualified designee , who is independent of and separated 
from routine monitori ng, may periodically arrange inspections/audits of the clinical study by 
reviewing the data obtained and procedural aspects. These inspections may include onsite 
inspections/audits and source data checks. Direct access to source documents is required for t he 
purpose of these periodic inspections/audits.  
11.1.14.  Data Collection and Management  
This study will be conducted in compliance with ICH GCP guidelines. This study will also be 
conducted in accordance with the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki.

eCRFs. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all sections of each eCRF are completed 
promptly and correctly and that entries can be verified agai nst any source data.  
Study monitors will perform source document verification to identify inconsistencies between the 
eCRFs and source documents. Discrepancies will be resolved in accordance with the principles of 
GCP. Detailed study monitoring procedures are provided in the clinical monitoring plan.  
Adverse events will be coded with MedDRA. Concomitant medications will be coded using 
WHODrug Global.  
11.1.15.  Source Documents  
Source documents are original documents or certified copies and include, but are not limite d to, 
eDiaries, medical and hospital records, screening logs, ICFs, telephone contact logs, and 
worksheets. Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are fi led at the Investigator’s site.  
Data reported on the case report form or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source 
documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. 
The Investigator may need to reques t previous medical records or transfer records, depending on 
the study. Also, current medical records must be available.  
The Sponsor or its designee requires that the Investigator prepare and maintain adequate and 
accurate records for each participant treated with the IP. Source documents such as any hospital, 
study site, or office charts and the signed ICFs are to be included in the Investigator’s files with 
the participant’s study records.  
11.1.16.  Retention of Records  
The Principal Investigator must maintain all documentation relating to the study for a period of at 
least 2 years after the last marketing application approval or, if not approved, 2 years following 
the discontinuance of the test article for investigation. If this requirement differs from any loc al 
regulations, the local regulations will take precedence unless the local retention policy is less than 
2 years.  
If it becomes necessary for the Sponsor or the regulatory authority to review any documentation 
relating to the study, the Investigator must permit access to such records. No records will be 
destroyed without the written consent of the Sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the 
Sponsor to inform the Investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.

Definitions: Woman of Childbearing Potential  
Females of childbearing potential are those who are considered fertile following menarche and 
until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (as follows). If fertility is unclear (eg, 
amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be confirmed before study 
vaccination, additional evaluation shou ld be considered.  
Females in the following categories are not considered females of childbearing potential:  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal  surgically sterile female with 1 of the following:  
a. Documented complete hysterectomy  
b. Documented surgical sterilization  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Müllerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), Investigator’s discretion should be 
applied when determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the  site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12  months without an alternative 
medical cause. The following age -specific requirements apply:  
− Females < 50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been 
amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal 
treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and FSH levels in the 
postm enopausal range for the institution.  
− Females ≥ 50 years of age would be considered postmenopausal if they have been 
amenorrheic for 12 months or more, had radiation -induced menopause with last 
menses >  1 year ago, or had chemotherapy -induced menopause with  last menses 
> 1 year ago.  
• A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormone replacement therapy (HRT).  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of 
the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to

Confidential  Page 135 continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.  
Contraception Guidance:  
Adequa te female contraception is defined as consistent and correct use of an FDA -approved 
contraceptive method in accordance with the product label. The following are examples:  
• Barrier method (such as condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap) used in conjunction 
with spermicide.  
• Intrauterine device.  
• Prescription hormonal contraceptive taken or administered via oral (pill), transdermal 
(patch), subdermal, or IM route.  
• Sterilization of a female participant’s monogamous male partner prior to entry into 
the study.  
Note th at periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

The document history table for this protocol and the Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes 
table for the current Amendment  4 is located direc tly before Section  1. 
Description of Amendments 1 , 2, and 3  are presented in this appendix.  
Amendment 1,  22 Jul 2021  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
The main purpose of this amendment is to incorporate a new part (Phase 2 Northern Hemisphere 
[NH]) into the study. By incorporating the Phase 2 NH part, the study intends to increase the size 
of the safety database for each dose level of the mRNA -1010 vacc ine tested in the originally 
planned (ie, Phase 1/2 part) study. In addition, the Phase  2 NH part of the study will include a 
composition change of mRNA -1010 (strain update for the 2021 -2022 NH season), as well as the 
inclusion of a licensed active compara tor. 
The summary of changes table provided here describes the major changes made in Amendment  1 
relative to the original protocol, including the sections modified and the corresponding rationales. 
As applicable, the synopsis of Amendment  1 has been modifie d to correspond to changes in the 
body of the protocol.  
Summary of Major Changes From Original Protocol to Protocol Amendment 1:  
Section # and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
Section 1.2 (Schema) and 
Section 1.3 (Schedule of 
Events)  • In the SoE for the Phase 1/2 part, the 
row specifying the assessment 
“Recording of SAEs and concomitant 
medications relevant to or for the 
treatment of the SAE” has been 
updated to include AESIs.  
• In the SoE for the Phase 1/2 part, the 
row specifying “study completion ” 
has been updated to change the 
wording to “Phase 1/2 completion” in 
line with the nomenclature used to 
identify the 2 study parts.  
• Added an instruction in footnote 4 
regarding vital sign measurements in 
the Phase 1/2 part SoE that the 
participants will b e seated for at least 
5 minutes before all measurements are 
taken.  • AESIs have been added to the 
Phase  1/2 part SoE as 1 of the 
safety assessments to be 
performed.  
• In the Phase 1/2 part SoE, added 
an instruction in footnote 4 for 
vital sign measurements to take 
measurements only after the 
participants have been rested in a 
seating position for at least 
5 minutes; number of 
participants in footnote 7 
regarding assessment of cellular 
immunogenicity samples has 
been updated; and added 
clarification in footnote  8 for NP 
swab collection that the NP swab 
samples may be collected at 
home if needed in lieu of a study 
site visit.

Confidential  Page 140 Section # and Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
• In the Phase 1/2 part SoE, footnote  7 
has been updated to specify that 
cellular immunogenicity samples will 
be collected from approximately 
40 participants per vaccination group 
instead of 25 participants per 
vaccination group as stated in the 
original protocol.  
• Added in footnote 8 regarding NP 
swab specimen in the Phase 1/2 part 
that the swabs may be collected as 
part of a home visit in lieu of a study 
site visit.  
• Added study design for the  Phase 2 
NH part. Added SoE planned for the 
Phase 2 NH part.  • To provide the time points for 
the evaluation of assessments 
planned for the Phase 2 NH part.  
Section 2.2.1 (mRNA -1010), 
Section 2.3.1 (Known 
Potential Benefits), and 
Section 2.3.3 (Overall 
Benefit/Risk Conclusion)  • Text has been updated to include 
information on the Phase 2 NH part of 
the study.  • Addition of a Phase 2 NH part to 
the originally planned study does 
not affect the potential benefits 
or risks associated with study 
participation for participants.  
Section 3 (Objectives and 
Endpoints)  • New section (Section  3.2: Phase 2 
NH) has been created to provide the 
objectives and endpoints of the newly 
added Phase 2 NH part of the study.  
• The following  exploratory objective 
for the Phase 1/2 part of the study “To 
assess the occurrence of clinical 
influenza in study participants and 
characterize their immune response to 
infection and viral isolates” has been 
revised to “To assess the occurrence 
of ILI in  study participants and 
characterize their immune response to 
infection and viral isolates.” 
Corresponding endpoint description 
has also been updated wherein 
laboratory -confirmed clinical 
influenza was updated to 
“RT-PCR -confirmed ILI.”  
• The primary safety endpoint of 
reporting of any SAEs and MAAEs 
from Day 1 through Day 181/EoS for 
the Phase 1/2 part has been updated to 
include AESIs as well.  • Provided the objectives and 
endpoints of the Phase 2 NH part 
of the study.

Phase 2 NH part of the study.”  • Addition of the Phase 2 NH part 
resulted in updating the EoS 
definition as the study can be 
considered ended (ie, complete) 
only when the last participant’s 
last visit in the Phase 2 NH p art 
is completed.  
Section 5 (Study Population)  • Added inclusion and exclusion criteria 
for the Phase 2 NH part in 
Section  5.2.1 and Section  5.2.2,

Synopsis: Overall Study 
Design; Section 4.1. (General 
Design); Section 4.3. (Choice 
of Vaccine Dose); Section 6.1. 
(Investigational Products 
Administered);  Section 6.2.2. 
(Phase 2 Northern 
Hemisphere); Section 6.3.1. 
(Preparation of Investigational 
Product); Section 9.3. (Sample 
Size Determination)  • Updated the Phase 2 NH part of the 
study to test 3 dose levels of 
mRNA -1010 (25, 50, and 100 µg total 
mRNA)  • Based on interim analysis results 
of the Phase 1/2 study, the 
200 μg dose of mRNA -1010 did 
not meet the Sponsor's desired 
reactogenicity profile. The 
Sponsor intends to test a lower 
dose level of 25 µg in lieu of 
200 µg, keeping the previous 
dose levels of 50  and 100 µg 
unchanged.

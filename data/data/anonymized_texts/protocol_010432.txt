The safet y analyses will be based on the “ Safet y” population, unless otherwise specified.
8.1. Overview of Planned A dverse Events Analy ses
Adverse Events will becoded using Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA) central coding dictionary andsummarized by  cohort . 
Counting of AEs will be based on the number of subjects –not the number of AEs. For 
example, if a subject experiences the same AE (i.e. same preferred term) more than once, 
they are counted only once under the count for the preferred term. If a subject 
experience smore than one AE in a particular system organ class ( SOC ), they  will onl y be 
included once in the count for the SOC, but will appear in the count for each appropriate 
preferred term within the SOC. Therefore, the sum of the 
numbers of subjects with each 
preferred term event within a SOC may exceed the total number of subjects with at least 
one event.

These data will be indicated by the use of a “blank” in subject listing 
displays. Unless all data for a specific visit are missing in which case the 
data is excluded from the table. 
Answers such as “Not applicable” and “Not evaluable” are not considered to be 
missing data and should be displayed as such.
Outliers Any subjects excluded from the summaries and/or statistical analyses will be 
documented along with the reason for exclusion in the clinical study report.
10.6.2.1 Handling of Missing Dates
Element Reporting Detail
General Partial dates will be displayed as captured in subject listing displays.
Adverse 
EventsThe eCRF allows for the possibility of partial dates (i.e., only month and year) to 
be recorded for AE start and end dates; that is, the day of the month may be 
missing. In such a case, th e following conventions will be applied for calculating 
the time to onset and the duration of the event:
Missing Start Day: First of the month will be used unless this is before the 
start date of investigational product; in this case the study treatment s tart 
date will be used (and hence the event is considered On -treatment as per 
CONFIDENTIA L
200231
41Element Reporting Detail
Appendix 3: Treatment States and Phases).
Missing Stop Day : Last day of the month will be used, unless this is after the 
stop date of study treatment; in this case the study treatment stop date will 
be used.
Completely missing start or end dates will remain missing, with no imputation 
applied. Consequently, time to onset and duration of such events will be 
missing.
AEs with entirely missing or unknown start dates will be assumed to be on -
treatment for reporting. 
AEs with missing end dates are not anticipated to affect reporting. 
10.6.2.2 Handling of Partial Dates
Element Reporting Detail
Concomitant 
MedicationsPartial dates for any concomitant med ications recorded in the CRF will be 
imputed using the following convention:
If the partial date is a start date, a '01' will be used for the day and 'Jan' will 
be used for the month
If the partial date is a stop date, a '28/29/30/31' will be used for the day 
(dependent on the month and year) and 'Dec' will be used for the month.
The recorded partial date will be displayed in listings.
Adverse 
EventsAny partial dates for adverse events will be raised to data management. If the 
full date cannot be ascertai ned, the following assumptions will be made for 
calculating the time to onset and the duration of the event :
If the partial date is a start date, a '01' will be used for the day and 'Jan' will 
be used for the month , unless this is before the start date of investigational 
product; in this case the study treatment start date will be used (and hence 
the event is considered on -treatment as per Appendix 3 : Treatment States).
If the partial date is a stop date, a '28/29/30/31 ' will be used for the day 
(dependent on the month and year) and 'Dec' will be used for the month , 
unless this is after the stop date of study treatment; in this case the study 
treatment stop date will be used.
The recorded partial date will be displayed i n listings.

4210.6.2.3 Handling of PK Concentration Data
Element Reporting Detail
GeneralThe PK population will be used for the concentration listing, summaries and 
plotting of the individual concentration-time profiles.
PK assay results from samples collected from a subject with vomiting occurring 
within 2 times the median Tmax will not be considered as evaluable .
For missing and NQ values, r efer to GUI_51487 .

Endpoint(s) PK End points AUC (0-t), AUC ( 0-∞), Cmax , and t½
Analysis ANOVA (primary) and ANCOVA (sensitivity)
Assumptions:
For the Mixed Model, model assumptions will be checked , andappropriate adjustments may 
be applied based on the data.
Distri butional assumptions underlying the model used for analysis will be examined by 
obtaining a normal probability plot of the residuals and a plot of the residuals versus the fitted 
values (i.e. checking the normality assumption and constant variance assumption of the 
model respectively) to gain confidence that the model assumptions are reasonable. 
If there are any departures from the distributional assumptions, alternative transformations, 
such as data squared or square root of data , will be explored. 
Non-parametric analyses willbe conducted if the normality assumption does not hold.

228. SAFETY ANAL YSES
The safet y analyses will be based on the “ Safet y” population, unless otherwise specified.
8.1. Overview of Planned A dverse Events Analy ses
Adverse Events will be coded using Medical D ictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA) central coding dictionary andsummarized by  cohort . 
Counting of AEs will be based on the number of subjects 
–not the number of AEs. For 
example, if a subject experiences the same AE (i.e. same preferred term) more than once, 
they are counted onl y once under the count for the preferred term. If a subject 
experience smore than one AE in a particular system organ class ( SOC ), they  will only  be 
included once in the count for the SOC, but will appear in the count fo r each appropriate 
preferred term within the SOC. Therefore, the sum of the numbers of subjects with each 
preferred term event within a SOC may exceed the total number of subjects with at least 
one event.

GeneralA completed subject is one who has completed all phases of the study 
including the follow- up visit. 
Withdrawn subjects may be replaced in the study. 
All subjects who withdraw prematurely from the study will be documented and 
the reason for their withdrawal recorded in the final Clinical Pharmacology 
Study Report (CPSR).  
All available data collected up until the point of withdrawal, and the follow -up 
visits will be used in the analyses and will be listed and all available planned 
data will be included in the summaries according to the populations defined in 
Section 4unless otherwise specified .
10.6.2. Handling of Missing Data
Element Reporting Detail
General Missing data occurs when any requested data is not provided, leading to blank 
fields on the collection instrument:
These data will be indicated by the use of a “blank” in subject listing 
displays. Un less all data for a specific visit are missing in which case the 
data is excluded from the table. 
Answers such as “Not applicable” and “Not evaluable” are not considered to be 
missing data and should be displayed as such.
Outliers Any subjects excluded f rom the summaries and/or statistical analyses will be 
documented along with the reason for exclusion in the clinical study report.
10.6.2.1. Handling of Missing Dates
Element Reporting Detail
General Partial dates will be displayed as captured in subject listing displays.
Adverse 
EventsThe eCRF allows for the possibility of partial dates (i.e., only month and year) to 
be recorded for AE start and end dates; that is, the day of the month may be 
missing. In such a case, the following conventions will be applied fo r calculating 
the time to onset and the duration of the event:
Missing Start Day: First of the month will be used unless this is before the 
start date of investigational product; in this case the study treatment start 
date will be used (and hence the even t is considered On -treatment as per 
CONFIDENTIA L
200231
38Element Reporting Detail
Appendix 3: Treatment States ).
Missing Stop Day : Last day of the month will be used, unless this is after the 
stop date of study treatment; in this case the study treatment stop date will 
be used.
Completely missing start or end dates will remain missing, with no imputation 
applied. Consequently, time to onset and duration of such events will be 
missing.
AEs with entirely missing or unknown start dates will be assumed to be on -
treatme nt for reporting. 
AEs with missing end dates are not anticipated to affect reporting. 
10.6.2.2. Handling of Partial Dates
Element Reporting Detail
Concomitant 
MedicationsPartial dates for any concomitant medications recorded in the CRF will be 
imputed using th e following convention:
If the partial date is a start date, a '01' will be used for the day and 'Jan' will 
be used for the month
If the partial date is a stop date, a '28/29/30/31' will be used for the day 
(dependent on the month and year) and 'Dec' will be used for the month.
The recorded partial date will be displayed in listings.
Adverse 
EventsAny partial dates for adverse events will be raised to data management. If the 
full date cannot be ascertained, the following assumptions will be made for 
calcu lating the time to onset and the duration of the event :
If the partial date is a start date, a '01' will be used for the day and 'Jan' will 
be used for the month , unless this is before the start date of investigational 
product; in this case the study treat ment start date will be used (and hence 
the event is considered on -treatment as per Appendix 3 : Treatment States).
If the partial date is a stop date, a '28/29/30/31' will be used for the day 
(dependent on the month and year) and 'Dec' will be used for the month , 
unless this is after the stop date of study treatment; in this case the study 
treatment stop date will be used.
The recorded partial date will be displayed in listings.

Analysis ANOVA (primary) and ANCOVA (sensitivity)
Assumptions:
For the Mixed Model, model assumptions will be checked , andappropriate adjustments may 
be applied based on the data.
Distributional assumptions underlying the model used for analysis will be examined by 
obtaining a normal probability plot of the residuals and a plot of the residuals versus the fitted 
values (i.e. checking the normality assumption and constant variance assumption of the 
model respectively) t o gain confidence that the model assumptions are reasonable. 
If there are any departures from the distributional assumptions, alternative transformations, 
such as data squared or square root of data , will be explored. 
Non-parametric analyses willbe cond ucted if the normality assumption does not hold.

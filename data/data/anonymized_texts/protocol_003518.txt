 CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT HISTORY  
Amendment 6  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to revise and add objectives and endpoints , as well as 
to define the statistical testing hierarchy for  the primary and key secondary endpoints.    
Description of Change  Brief Rationale  Section(s) Changed  
Objectives, Endpoints, and Planned Statistical Analysis   
The following modifications 
were  made to the planned 
statistical analysis : 
 
• Revised the primary objective 
and endpoint  for cohort A  The revision of the primary objective and 
endpoint for cohort A  is informed by the 
administrative assessment  of 409 cohort A 
seronegative subjects, where there was a 100% 
reduction in sym ptomatic events  (broad -term)  
in the REGN10933+REGN10987 treated 
subjects  as compared to the placebo treated 
subjects  with 8/223 (3.6%) placebo treated 
subjects developing symptomatic infection 
versus 0/186 (0%) REGN10933+REGN10987 
treated subjects; OR 0.00 (0.00, 0.69) p<0.01 . 
The single primary objective is now to evaluate 
the efficacy of REGN10933+REGN10987 
compared to placebo in preventing 
symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection (broad -
term) confirmed by RT -qPCR  Clinical Study Protocol

• Added a primary objective 
and endpoint for cohort B  
 Because cohort B is a separate population from 
cohort A, where cohort B subjects are infected  
at baseline  (SARS -CoV -2 RT-qPCR positive ), 
a new primary objective and endpoint was 
added  to evaluate whether 
REGN10933+REGN10987 may be efficacious 
as preemptive therapy to prevent symptoms in 
those who are already infected , therefore the 
objective is  to evaluate the efficacy of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 compared to 
placebo in preventing COVID -19 symptoms 
(broad -term) in asymptomatic subjects that are 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive and

subjects, such that revised key secondary 
endpoints now include the evaluation of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 as compared to 
placebo to reduce high viral load, defined as  
viral load >4 (log 10 copies/mL) , duration of

cohort B  The statistical testing hierarchy was determined  
by considering which endpoints would  be most 
relevant and important to understand the 
efficacy of  REGN10933+REGN10987   to 
prevent symptomatic infection and 
transmission  potential, including the prevention 
of infections with high viral loads , longer 
duration of high viral loads , and whether 
REGN10933+REGN10987 can be considered 
for treatment of the symp tomatic infected 
household member to prevent infection of the 
uninfected household member.  Section 11.4.4.  Control of

 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 5  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to describe the verification of the sample size 
assumptions used to design the study.   
Description of Change  Brief Rationale  Section(s)  Changed  
• Added an administrative 
assessment for assumption 
verification and sample size 
estimation for the study  
• Sample size increase d to 
3500  subjects to ensure that 
the formal analysis of the 
phase 3 study has an 
adequate sample size . The initial sample  size assumptions used for 
the study design were based on COVID -19 
household contact infection rates observed 
in the literature available during study 
planning.  Currently, the range of reported 
infection rates, including onset of infection 
and symptomatic  infection, is more variable 
in the literature than originally understood.  
Some early study data will be used, 
therefore, to verify the assumptions and 
estimated sample size by assessing infection 
rates in the population in this study.  Clinical Study Prot ocol Synopsis:

 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 4  
The primary purposes of this amendment are 1) to change from 2 primary endpoints to 1 primary 
endpoint, 2) to increase the sample size, 3) to allow for the inclusion of pediatric subjects aged 
<12 years, 4) to allow for the inclusion of women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and 5) to add 
an exploratory objective and endpoint to assess whether the treatment of index cases with 
REGN10933+REGN10987 in the R10933 -10987 -COV -2067 study has an impact on rates of 
infectivity i n household contacts in this study.  The endpoint and sample size changes are based 
on blinded review of the data with regard to SARS -CoV -2 infection events and baseline 
seropositivity prevalence in cohort A. The inclusion of pediatric subjects younger tha n 12 years 
and pregnant or breastfeeding women is considered relevant to the populations at risk for infection 
with SARS -CoV -2. 
Description of Change  Brief Rationale  Section(s) Changed  
• Study now has 1 primary 
efficacy endpoint: 
proportion of SARS -CoV -
2 infection during the 
efficacy assessment period 
(EAP). The proportion of  
“strict -term” symptomatic 
SARS -CoV -2 infection 
during the EAP has been 
moved to a secondary 
endpoint.   A blinded analysis of approximately 25% of 
enrolled subjects was performed, 
demonstrating that lower than expected 
symptomatic infection events were 
observed in Cohort A: adult and adolescent 
Subjects (≥12 years) who are SARS -CoV -2 
RT-qPCR Negative  at Baseline.  If 
2 primary endpoints were to be retained, the 
study is considered infe asible as the sample 
size would need to increase several fold to 
have enough symptomatic events in cohort 
A to be powered sufficiently.  The single 
primary endpoint of the prevention of 
laboratory confirmed SARS -CoV -2 
infection is considered highly clinica lly 
important because infection is the necessary 
antecedent event for illness.  Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis:

women.  Inclusion of pediatric subjects, 
pregnant women, and breastfeeding women 
is supported by ongoing blinded review of 
the safety profile in adult and adolescent 
subjects, which is demonstrating that 
REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment is 
sufficiently well -tolerated.  In addition, 
there is no human fetal tissue cross -
reactivity of REGN10933 and REGN10987 
to suggest a risk to the fetus. The safety 
profile in pediatric subjects less than 12 
years and pregnant and breastfeeding 
women is expected to be similar to that 
observed in adults and adolescents.  
 
Because pregnant women are allow ed in the 
study, contraception for women of 
childbearing potential (WOCBP) is no 
longer required as an exclusion criterion.  
However, WOCBP will undergo pregnancy 
testing prior to dosing and at the end of 
study.  Women who are pregnant or who 
become pregna nt during the study will be 
followed for the outcome of their 
pregnancy.  The inclusion of pregnant 
women who are identified at study entry as 
well as women who become pregnant 
during the study will provide important 
safety and efficacy data in this popula tion at 
increased risk of severe COVID -19. 
 
Because pregnant women are allowed in the 
study, contraception for men enrolled in the 
study is no longer required as an exclusion 
criterion.   Information regarding 
pregnancies occurring in the female 
partners o f male study subjects will not be 
solicited as the risk of exposure is 
negligible in this scenario  
 
The stratification is to ensure relative 
balance in treatment allocation among 
different pediatric weight groups for PK 
analysis.  Section 1.5 A Randomized, Placebo -

Description of Change  Brief Rationale  Section(s) Changed  
• Adolescent subjects aged 
12 years to less than 18 
years are added to the 
study  
 
 
• Provided a rationale for 
dose selection for 
adolescent subjects (≥40 
kg) 
 
 
 
 
• Revised the description of 
women of childbearing 
potential (WOCBP) to 
include ‘girls at or beyond 
menarche (≥12 to <18 
years of age)’  
 
• Added description of the 
informed consent process Adolescent subjects ≥12 to <18 years of 
age (weight ≥40 kg) are added to the 
study because they are a population at 
risk of SARS -CoV -2 infection in a 
household .   
 
Inclusion of adolescent subjects is 
supported by ongoing blin ded review of 
the safety profile, which is 
demonstrating that 
REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment is 
well-tolerated in more than 1000 adult 
subjects who have received drug.  
 
Defined the age range for adolescent 
female subjects to be considered

The rate of symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 
infections among adolescent subjects 
may differ from adults. Since adolescent 
subjects are being added after the start 
of the study, greater flexibility in the

is needed to ensure that the attack rate

 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 2  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to remove the requirement for subjects to have at least 
48 hours of sustained exposure to the index case. The 48 -hour exposure requirement is considered 
to be too restrictive and not necessary since the subject is expected to be living in the same 
household with the index case. Additionally, the definition of ‘ho usehold’ was updated to clarify 
the specific characteristics of a household; the guidance for the conduct of the local diagnostic 
assay testing at baseline was revised; and the analysis of cohort B was revised to include all 
subjects at baseline (ie, subje cts who are seropositive or seronegative).   
• Revised the description o f 
the automated reminders to 
being optional if not 
technically feasible 
(language barriers, no 
mobile phone, etc)   
 
 
 
• Modify the analysis for 
continuous endpoints from 
GEE model to 
ANOVA/ANCOVA 
model.   
The use of automated reminders was 
made optional in case of 
technical/operational difficulties/delays 
in implementation.  
 
 
 
 
 
For continuous endpoints the analysis 
population consists of those subjects 
who have at least 1 positive RT -qPCR 
during EAP instead of all subjects in 
full analysis set (FAS) (ie, smaller 
sample size). Thus, the ANOVA model 
will be used and for change and percent 
change from baseline endpoints  the 
relevant baseline values will be 
included as covariate in the model (ie, 
ANCOVA model).

 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 1  
The purpose of this amendment is to change the collection of respiratory samples for SARS -CoV -2 
reverse -transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT -qPCR) from nasal swabs and 
saliva samples to nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples due to analysis of data from baseline samples 
from the REGN10933 +REGN10987 treatment studies, where study patients were sampled by NP 
swabs, nasal swabs, and saliva for side -by-side comparison.  NP swabs had markedly better 
sensitivity to detect SARS -CoV -2 than nasal swabs and saliva samples.  Additionally, the 
require ment for local serology testing at baseline was removed because it is anticipated that most 
subjects will be negative and local serology testing is not feasible at many sites. In addition, this 
amendment includes updates to address health authority feedbac k and collaborator comments.  
Description of Change  Brief Rationale  Section(s) Changed  
• Changed collection from nasal 
swabs and saliva samples to 
nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs for 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test  
• Removed collection of nasal 
swab and saliva samples for 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test  
• Removed endpoints based on 
analysis of saliva samples for 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test  
• Clarified that molecular 
diagnostic RT -PCR tests, 
qualitative and quantitative, 
will be unblinded to site 
personnel and the Sponsor  Based on review of  blinded 
RT-PCR data from 
REGN10933 -10987 treatment 
studies, use of NP swab 
samples had better sensitivity 
to detect RT -PCR positivity 
than nasal swab and saliva 
samples.  
 
 
 
This change is to ensure proper 
medical care and isolation of 
positive subjects and to ensure 
appropriate quality control of 
NP samples.  Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis: Study

• Removed collection of local 
serology (onsite) at baseline  The purpose of including local 
serology testing as a 
stratification factor for 
randomization was to improve 
the relative balance of 
enrollment of seronegative and 
seropositive subjects in each of 
the study arms.  However, due 
to clinical laboratory 
restric tions, local testing using 
the lateral flow immunoassay 
is not feasible at most sites. 
Additionally, the majority of 
subjects are expected to be 
seronegative. Because serology 
testing will be performed by 
the central lab, subgroup 
analyses will be performe d 
using baseline central lab 
serology data and this analysis 
will not be affected by the 
elimination of local serology 
testing.   Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis: Study

Title  A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study Assessing 
the Efficacy and Safety of Anti -Spike SARS -CoV -2 Monoclonal Antibodies in 
Preventing SARS -CoV -2 Infection in Household Contacts of Individuals 
Infected with SARS -CoV -2 
Site Location(s)  
 Principal Investigator  Multiple sites in the United S tates (US) and other countries  
TBD  
Objectives  The primary efficacy objective for cohort A ( subjects who are negative for 
SARS -CoV -2 infection at baseline ) is to evaluate the efficacy of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 (also referred to as casirivimab+imdevimab) 
compared to placebo in preventing symptomatic  SARS -CoV -2 infection 
(broad -term) that is confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction  (RT-qPCR , the central laboratory testing in this study ).   
The primary efficacy objective for cohort B ( subjects who are positive for 
SARS -CoV -2 infection but asymptomatic at baseline ) is to evaluate the efficacy 
of REGN10933+REGN10987 compared to placebo  in preventing COVID -19 
symptoms (broad -term).  
Symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infections will be defined by strict and broad 
definitions, as well as by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) case definition.  
A strict definition includes : fever  PLUS ≥1 respiratory symptoms (sore throat, 
cough, shortness of breath), OR 2 respiratory symptoms, OR 1  respiratory 
symptom PLUS ≥2 non -respiratory symptoms (chills, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, headache, conjunctivitis, myalgia, arthralgia, loss of taste or smell, 
fatigue or general malaise).   
A broad definition includes:  the signs/symptoms in the strict definition and 
additional symptoms (23 terms: Feverish, Sore throat, Cough, Shortness of 
breath/difficulty breathing [nasal flaring*], Chills, Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, 
Headache, Red or watery eyes, Body aches such as muscle pain or joint pain, 
Loss of taste/smell, Fatigue [fatigue or general malaise or lethargy*], Loss of 
appetite or poor eating/feeding, Confusion, Dizziness, Pressure/tightness in 
chest, Chest pain, Stomach  ache (abdominal pain*), Rash, Sneezing, Runny 
nose, Sputum/phlegm [*Signs and symptoms observed in pediatric subjects]).  
The CDC definition is:  at least 2 of the following symptoms: fever (measured 
or subjective), chills, rigors, myalgia, headache, sore throat, nausea or vomiting, 
diarrhea, fatigue, congestion or runny nose OR Any 1 of the following 
symptoms: cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, new olfactory 
disorder, new taste disorder OR Severe respiratory illness with at least 1 of the 
following, clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS).  
There are 4 defined cohorts in this study based on the subjects’ age and 
SARS -CoV -2 infection status at baseline, as measured by central lab 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR:  
1. Cohort A: adult and adolescent subjects (≥12 years) who are 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR negative at baseline  
2. Cohort A1: pediatric subjects (<12 years) who are SARS -CoV -2 
RT--qPCR negative at baseline  
3. Cohort B: adult and adolescent subjects (≥12 year s) who are 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive at baseline

Study Design  This is a phas e 3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study in adults, 
adolescents, and children with household contact exposure to individuals with 
SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
All subjects in the study will be household contacts with close exposure to the 
first hous ehold member known to be infected with SARS -CoV -2 (index case) 
but who are themselves asymptomatic (having no active respiratory or 
non-respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID -19) but may be either 
positive or negative for SARS -CoV -2 during screening, a s assessed by central 
laboratory RT -qPCR performed at baseline. The index case will have a 
diagnosis of SARS -CoV -2 infection using a diagnostic test, eg, RT -PCR, 
antigen test, or other test format (approved or with Emergency Use 
Authorization [EUA] issued by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] 
or by the equivalent local health authority).  
Randomization will be performed by individual study subjects, not by 
households.  
Approximately 3500 adult and adolescent (≥12 years) + 250  pediatric subjects 
(<12 years) will be enrolled.  
Screening/Baseline (day 1)  
After subjects provide informed consent, they will be assessed for study 
eligibility.  The screening visit and randomization visit should occur on the 
same day.  If needed, a remote visit may occur to sig n the ICF and collect 
medical history and concomitant medication use, on the day prior to, but within 
24 hours of study drug administration, so that the in -person screening and 
randomization visit may be abbreviated, due to COVID -19 considerations. 
Study d rug administration must occur within 96 hours of collection of the index 
cases’ positive SARS -CoV -2 diagnostic test sample.  On day 1, prior to 
randomization, a local diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2 from appropriate 
samples will be performed. The results o f this assay will be used as a 
                                        VV-RIM-00142963-1.0 Approved - 25 Mar 2021 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  stratification factor for randomization to treatment groups (placebo or 
REGN10933+REGN10987).  The requirement for a local diagnostic assay for 
SARS -CoV -2 is waived when the results are not expected to be available in a 
timel y manner for randomization.  Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sample 
(swabbing through both nostrils in adults/adolescents and through one nostril in 
pediatrics <12 years) for central lab testing of SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR and 
blood sample for central lab serology will  also be collected and sent to central 
lab. On day  1, after completing baseline assessments, sample collection, and 
randomization, all subjects will receive a single dose of study drug.  
Randomization will be performed on an individual subject basis. In ad dition to 
a randomization number, all subjects randomized will be given a household 
identification number in the case that multiple members of the same household 
are enrolled and receive study drug.  This ensures that correlation among 
subjects within the same household may be considered in the statistical analysis.  
Randomization will be performed by site and stratified for assignment of 
treatment group by test results (positive, negative, or undetermined) of a local 
diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2 (eg, mol ecular assay such as RT -PCR assay 
for SARS -CoV -2 or a SARS -CoV -2 antigen test) from appropriate samples, eg, 
nasopharyngeal (NP), oropharyngeal (OP), nasal, or saliva, and age group 
(≥12  to <18 years, ≥18 to <50 years, or ≥50 years).  For pediatric subject s 
(<12  years), the weight group (≥20 kg, ≥10 to <20 kg, and <10 kg) will be used 
as an additional stratification factor. The local diagnostic assay for 
SARS -CoV -2 must be considered acceptable for clinical use by local standards. 
If the test has not been a pproved or received EUA issued by the US FDA or by 
the equivalent local health authority, then the Sponsor should be consulted.  
Cohort allocation will be based on central lab baseline SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR 
results for data analysis: cohort A or cohort A1 (neg ative) and cohort B or 
cohort B1 (positive). Statistical analyses will be conducted separately in each 
cohort which will be based on central lab determination of viral positivity and 
serological status.  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio  to 1 of 2 treatment groups 
(placebo or REGN10933+REGN10987 [1200 mg (600 mg of each mAb SC)]).  
This study was preceded by safety review of data from other studies:  a safety 
sentinel group of 30 patients with COVID -19 dosed with 
REGN10933+REGN10987 2400 m g IV, REGN10933+REGN10987 8000  mg 
IV or placebo in the leading phase 1 studies of REGN10933+REGN10987 in 
the treatment of COVID -19 patients. Randomization in this study did not begin 
until the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) for the treatment

 CONFIDENTIAL  Sentinel Group (day 1 to day 4)  
Enrollment in this study was carried out in 2 phases:  
Sentinel group of approximately 30 adult subjects, irrespective of allocation to 
cohort A or cohort B.  
1. Subjects were monitored for safety on -site for a minimum of 4 hours after 
administration of the first dose of study drug and then daily via visits to th e 
study site or phone calls for the first 4 days (96 hours).  Because 
REGN10933+REGN10987 had already cleared an adult safety sentinel 
cohort at higher doses administered IV in previous studies, the sentinel 
group in this study focused on safety evaluation  for injection site reactions 
and hypersensitivity reactions, and data were reviewed before progressing 
with enrollment of additional study subjects. The blinded safety data review 
was led by a designated member of the Regeneron clinical team (generally 
either the medical monitor or the clinical trial manager) and at a minimum 
the data review team included the Regeneron Medical Monitor, Study 
Biostatistician, Global Safety Lead or designee, and the Senior Vice 
President of Early Clinical Development & Exper imental Sciences.  
2. Following a conclusion of the blinded safety data review that the study 
could proceed, the study resumed enrollment.  
Pediatric Sentinel Subjects and Staggered Enrollment/Dosing:  
Approximately 250 pediatric subjects across all weight -tiered dose ranges will 
be enrolled.  However, since the enrollment of pediatric subjects (<12  years) 
will end once enrollment of adult and adolescent subjects is complete, the 
number of pediatric subj ects may be adjusted.    
Enrollment of pediatric subjects in this study will be carried out in 2 phases each 
for safety assessment and for confirmation of appropriate level of drug exposure 
for each weight group.  
Pediatric Subjects Safety Sentinel Group  
1. Sentinel group will comprise 12 pediatric subjects (by subject number 
assigned by IWRS; irrespective of allocation to cohort A1 or cohort 
B1) in 3 weight groups (≥20 kg; 10 kg to <20 kg; <10 kg).  Each weight 
group will have 4 subjects randomized 1:1  to 1 of  2 treatment groups 
(placebo or REGN10933+REGN10987) and study drug administered 
first.  After all 4 subjects in a weight group complete the sentinel 
review, enrollment of additional subjects in that weight group will 
proceed.  Pediatric subjects will be m onitored for safety on -site for a 
minimum of 2 hours after administration of study drug and then daily 
via visits to the study site or phone calls for the first 4 days (96 hours). 
Because REGN10933+REGN10987 has already cleared an adult 
safety sentinel coh ort at higher doses administered IV in previous 
studies and the adult safety sentinel in this study, the pediatric sentinel 
group in this study is focused on safety evaluation for injection site 
reactions and hypersensitivity reactions.  Data will be revie wed before 
progressing with enrollment of additional pediatric subjects. The 
blinded safety data review will be led by a designated member of the 
Regeneron clinical team (generally either the medical monitor or the 
clinical trial manager) and at a minimum the data review team will 
include the Regeneron Medical Monitor, Study Biostatistician, Global 
Safety Lead or designee, and the Senior Vice President of Early 
Clinical Development & Experimental Sciences.  
2. Following a conclusion of the blinded safety data r eview that the study 
may proceed for a weight group, the enrollment of pediatric subjects 
in that weight group will resume.  However, close monitoring by the

 CONFIDENTIAL  Safety Review Committee will continue on a periodic cumulative 
aggregate basis, including stratifi cation to facilitate early and periodic 
review of data for adolescent subjects (≥12 years to <18 years)  and 
pediatric subjects (<12 years) in each of the weight groups.   
Confirmation of Drug Exposure for Pediatric Subjects Weight Groups  
1. All pediatric subjects (subset 4 and subset 5) will have samples 
collected (Schedules A, B, C, and D) in the EAP and Follow -Up 
periods for drug concentration measurement as well as ADA 
assessment and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, blood 
chemistry).  The drug con centration data  from approximately the first 
20 subjects per weight group (<10 kg, 10 to 20 kg, ≥20 kg) will be 
evaluated to confirm that the REGN10933 and REGN10987 dose for 
the weight group is providing the expected exposure.   
2. Based on simulations u sing a population PK model using data from 
adult patients with COVID -19, the proposed doses for the pediatric 
subjects (see Table below) is expected to match the exposure in adult 
subjects at SC dose of 1200 mg (600 mg per mAb) in this study.  Once 
the exp osure for a dose is confirmed in a weight group, enrollment 
beyond 25 subjects for this weight group can continue.  Based on the 
results of the drug concentration analyses from up to 20 pediatric 
subjects receiving active drug in the weight groups, the dos e for 
participating pediatric subjects may be adjusted in 1 or more of the 
weight -tiered group(s) to ensure drug exposure comparable to adult 
subjects in this study.  If the dose for a particular weight group needs 
to be adjusted, the new dose for that wei ght group will used for 
approximately a subsequent 20 subjects for that weight group.  These 
subjects who received the new dose will have drug concentrations 
analyzed to confirm that it is providing the expected exposure.  When 
the new dose is started, the  subjects will resume dosing according to 
the next sample collection schedule since the last subject received 
study drug.  
Efficacy Assessment Period (day 1 to day 29)   
Efficacy, safety, sample collections, and other study assessments will be 
performed at s pecified time points throughout the efficacy assessment period 
(EAP).  If subjects are able to travel and can do so while maintaining social 
distancing guidelines, subsequent site visits will be conducted; alternatively, 
telemedicine visits, phone calls, m obile units or home health nurses may be 
utilized.  Throughout the study, biological samples will be obtained by 
adequately trained and delegated study personnel at study locations where 
appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) are available to be u sed.  
Subjects will be instructed to contact the study site staff for any new or changing 
symptoms or signs possibly related to COVID -19, including fever. The 
investigator should recommend that subjects (themselves or by their 
parent/guardian) measure thei r temperature daily during the EAP, 
approximately at the same time, and also every time when the subject feels 
feverish, chills, or sick.  Adult subjects may receive automated reminders (eg, 
text messages to mobile phones; implemented as soon as technologi cally 
feasible and when subjects confirm to opt in) in between the weekly visits to 
prompt them to contact the study site staff as needed.  
At each weekly visit, NP swab sample will be collected for SARS -CoV -2 
RT-qPCR to be tested at a central lab.  The inv estigator or designee will contact 
each subject weekly (site visit or telemedicine) to assess the subject’s general 
health, and to document all AEs in general, and any signs and symptoms 
associated with SARS -CoV -2 infection since the last contact.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Any subj ect who develops fever, an acute respiratory illness, symptoms related 
to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children ([MIS -C] [pediatric subjects 
<18 years only]), or other symptoms that they feel could be related to COVID -
19 should alert the study staf f immediately.  If the subject experiences a true 
medical emergency, they should visit their local hospital ED or call the local 
emergency telephone number (eg, 911 in North America) and contact the 
clinical site personnel later.  Subjects’ symptoms must b e evaluated by the 
investigator or designee, which can occur through site visit, mobile unit, home 
visit, telemedicine, etc. If the investigator or designee suspects SARS -CoV -2 
infection, a NP swab sample should be collected and sent for central lab testin g. 
The subject may also be asked to provide a blood sample if it corresponds to a 
scheduled visit (according to the Schedule of Events).  
Subjects with laboratory confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection during the EAP 
should be informed as soon as possible and should undergo medical isolation to 
prevent contact with others to reduce the risk of further transmission. Since 
these subjects will likely be isolated, the study visits, assessments and sample 
collections may occur through a variety of methods.  
All subje cts who have a confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection will continue to be 
tested (sample collection weekly) until 2 consecutive confirmed negative 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test results are achieved ≥24 hours apart .  This testing 
may continue through the EAP and into the  Follow -up period.  For subjects who 
have a confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection, the investigator will assess AEs 
weekly or more frequently than weekly, depending on the clinical status of the 
subject, as assessed by the investigator or designee (these more fre quent AE 
assessments will be reported as unscheduled visits).  The investigator will also 
collect information for any SARS -CoV -2 infection -related medically attended 
visits to the ED, UCC, or hospitalization starting from the timepoint of SARS -
CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive result.  
Subjects presenting with acute illness should be medically managed according 
to local standard of care as per the discretion of the treating physician.  
If a subject is hospitalized for suspected SARS -CoV -2 infection, every effort 
should be made by the site personnel to collect, as soon as possible, an NP swab 
sample for central lab SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR testing.  In subjects where it is 
not possible to have samples collected for assessment in the central laboratory, 
study site personnel will  attempt to obtain and record information about any 
positive SARS -CoV -2 assays conducted in local laboratories associated with 
other medical facilities.  
Follow -up Period (day 30 to day 225)  
Subjects who remain SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR negative throughout the EAP  
will complete the end of the EAP and enter the Follow -up Period to be followed 
for 7 months.  
Subjects who become SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive during the EAP will 
continue to have weekly NP swab samples for SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR testing 
until 2 confirmed negat ive SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test results are achieved at 
least 24  hours apart, even after they complete the EAP and enter the study 
Follow -up Period to be followed for 7 months.  In such situations, these visits 
for sample collection should be characterized as unscheduled visits.  
At each scheduled visit, the investigator or designee will contact each subject 
(site visit or telemedicine) to assess and document the subject’s general health, 
AEs in general and signs and symptoms associated with SARS -CoV -2 infection  
since the last contact, as described for the EAP.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Procedures and Assessments  Screening/Baseline Procedures:  
The following procedures will be performed for the purpose of determining 
study eligibility or characterizing the baseline population: demographics (eg, 
age, sex, race, weight, height, etc), medical history, local diagnostic assay for 
SARS -CoV -2, query for risk for SARS -CoV -2 infection, and household 
assessment in which subjects will be asked to provide general information about 
the household members.  
The investigator or sub -investigator will verify that the subject tests negative or 
positive by a local diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2 (eg, molecular assay such 
as RT -PCR assay for SARS -CoV -2 or a SARS -CoV -2 antigen test using an 
appropriate sample such as NP, nasal, OP, or saliva). The local diagnostic assay 
for SARS -CoV -2 must be considered acceptable for clinical use by local 
standards. If the test has not been approved or received EUA issued by the US 
FDA or by the equivalent local health authority, t hen the Sponsor should be 
consulted.  The use of a RT -PCR assay is highly recommended.  
The local diagnostic test result, specimen type (eg, nasal swab), assay type, and 
date of test will be recorded in the eCRF.  The sample type collected is 
dependent on local lab requirements.  
Efficacy Procedures:  
Nasopharyngeal Swab SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR Test (Central Lab) :  
Nasopharyngeal swab sample will be collected from subjects to determine 
presence or absence of SARS -CoV -2 virus and to determine the relative 
quantific ation in viral load.  
COVID -19 Symptomology (Broad Term, Strict Term, CDC definition) :  
During each scheduled or unscheduled visit/contact, the investigator or sub -
investigator, or designee (ie, nurse practitioner in countries where allowed by 
local law) wi ll query the subject and/or subject’s parent or guardian about 
adverse events the subject is experiencing or has experienced since the last 
visit/contact (eg, within the prior week if it is a weekly scheduled visit) and ask 
about all of the signs and sympt oms associated with these adverse events 
including the start date, end date and severity of each. The investigator should 
avoid querying the subject and/or subject’s parent or guardian by running a 
check -list of signs and symptoms, but rather allow the sub ject and/or subject’s 
parent or guardian to spontaneously report everything that they presented.  
All signs and symptoms related to the AEs, along with the corresponding start 
date, end date and severity should be documented in the subject’s medical 
record s (source document). As signs and symptoms may appear and resolve on 
different days and may precede or occur after the collection of NP swab sample 
for the SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test, it is important that this detailed 
information be captured in the source do cument.  
Independent of the results (positive or negative) of the SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR 
tests performed on samples collected from study subjects during the weekly or 
unscheduled visits, all adverse events must be documented in the AE CRF. 
Signs and symptoms re lated to the adverse events reported in the AE CRF and 
confirmed to be temporally related to a positive SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test 
collected from the subject’s NP swab sample will be reported on a separate CRF 
(individual sign or symptom with start date and e nd date, and associated 
severity).

Medically Attended Visits :  Subjects and/or their parent/guardian (as 
appropriate) who become SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive will be queried on 
any SARS -CoV -2 infection -related medically attended visits to the ED, UCC, 
or hospitalization.  The assessment of medically attended visits to ED, UCC or 
hospitalization will be performed  from the time  the subject first becomes 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive or from the time they develop symptoms 
suspected to be COV ID-19 (later confirmed by RT -qPCR positive results) until 
the subject has had 2 negative tests or COVID -19 related symptoms have 
resolved (whichever lasts longer), or of until the end of study visit.  
Absenteeism Assessment:   Subjects and/or their parent/gu ardian who are or 
become SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR positive during the EAP will be queried on any 
SARS -CoV -2 infection -related absenteeism. Data include absenteeism (where 
applicable) defined as number of days missed for daily responsibilities, 
including work (emp loyed adults) or school (students), daycare, or family 
obligations/responsibilities (childcare or eldercare) due to COVID -19. 
Safety Procedures:  
Targeted Physical Examination and Vital Signs :  The targeted physical 
examination and vital signs include measu rements of body temperature, blood 
pressure (measured after the subject has been resting quietly for at least 
5 minutes and may be obtained from a seated or supine position), pulse rate, 
and respiratory rate, and examination of the oropharynx, skin, heart,  lungs and 
any other system(s) depending on any complaints or concerns expressed by the 
subjects.  
Laboratory Testing :  samples for blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis 
(only for adolescent/adult subjects) will be collected and analyzed.  For all 
wom en of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed 
onsite and any positive urine pregnancy test will be confirmed with a serum 
pregnancy test at the central laboratory.

assess the impact of baseline humoral immunity/antibody response to 
SARS -CoV -2 on REGN10933+REGN10987 efficacy to prevent SARS -CoV -2 
infection, serum anti-SARS -CoV -2 will be measured at baseline, including but 
not limited to those which detect antibodies against the S protein and/or the 
N protein and/or neutralization assays. Samples will be collected from adult and 
pediatric subjects (<18 years).

and >10 kg) subjects may participate in an optional genomics sub -study 
(separate informed consent required).  Blood sample for RNA and DNA will be 
collected for this substudy.  
Statistical Plan  Justification of Sample Size  
An administrative assessment for assumption verification and sample size 
estimation for cohort A will be conducted using unblinded descriptive analys es 
without performing any formal statistical hypothesis testing.  Analyses will be 
conducted in the group o f cohort A subjects randomized from study initiation 
through the date of randomization that are associated with 30 RT -PCR events 
amongst cohort A seronegative subjects during the EAP  (approximately 600 
subjects overall regardless of baseline serology statu s[eg, seronegative , 
seropositive , or other (eg , borderline or undetermined, etc) ]).  The subjects 
evaluated in this descriptive analysis will not be included for the final efficacy  
analyses , howe ver, these subjects will be included in the safety analyses .  To 
maintain operational efficiencies and because of the progressive rollout of 
SARS -CoV -2 vaccination which may change the dynamics of virus 
transmission/infection in the near future, enrollment into the study will not be 
paused while the administrative  assessment  is performed and it is estimated that 
the total enrollment may reach approximately 3500 subjects.   The following 
justification of sample size in cohort A with the assumption of reduction of 
symptomatic infection is based on the results from the  administrative 
assessment described below. For the purpose of the study analysis, cohort A 
and cohort B are independent with separate type I error control for each cohort.  
Cohort A:  Adult and Adolescent Subjects (≥12years) Who Are SARS -CoV-2 
RT-qPCR Negat ive 
In cohort A, subjects are randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to 
REGN10933+REGN10987 or placebo.  The primary hypothesis is the reduction 
in the proportion of symptomatic RT -qPCR  (broad -term)  confirmed SARS -
CoV -2 infections  in seronegative subjects .  To calculate the sample size 
required to achieve at least 90% power for seronegative subjects in cohort A, it 
is assumed that the statistical hypothes is will be tested in a 2 -sided test.  Based 
on the administrative assessment results among 409 seronegat ive subjects in 
cohort A, a 50% reduction of infection s (symptomatic or asymptomatic ) 
compared to the placebo group and a 100% reduction of symptomatic infection s 
compared to placebo group were observed. Due to the small sample size in the 
                                        VV-RIM-00142963-1.0 Approved - 25 Mar 2021 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  administrative a ssessment, it was  assume d, for the purpose of assessing study 
power,  that an approximately 50% reduction or greater in symptomatic 
infection s compared to the placebo group will be expected for the final primary 
efficacy analysis.  
In this household study design,  the number of subjects per household, the 
correlation between subjects and symptomatic infection rates within a 
household are unknown .  To detect a relative risk of 0.5 (ie, 50% reduction of 
the assumed 10% attack rate in the placebo arm),  equivale nt to an odds ratio of 
0.47,  power was also calculated compared to the boundary p -value of 0.0 5 based 
on 2000 simulations in 1248 subjects from 430 households (ie , assuming an 
average household size of 2.9 seronegative subjects  by varying degrees of 
correl ation within household.  In all cases, the power of the study is >90% using 
a generalized linear model with the generalized estimation equation (GEE) 
approach and assuming a compound symmetry covariance matrix.  
At least  1980 subjects will need to be enrolled in cohort A to have a  minimum 
of 1248  seronegative subjects, assuming that 10% of subjects drop out, 30% of 
subjects are seropositive at baseline.  
Cohort A1: Pediatric Subjects  (<12 years) with  SARS -CoV-2 RT -qPCR 
Negative  
Approximately up to a total of 250 pediatric subjects (<12 years) will be 
enrolled in this study. Of the 250 subjects, 90% (225/250) are expected to be 
enrolled in this cohort (ie, central lab RT -qPCR negative at baseline) for 
evaluating the drug con centration and exposure, and safety. The actual number 
of subjects in this cohort will depend on the actual percentage of subjects with 
a baseline negative RT -qPCR enrolled. No statistical hypothesis tests will be 
performed.  
Cohort B: SARS -CoV-2 RT -qPCR Po sitive  
The primary endpoint in asymptomatic, seronegative subjects in cohort B is the 
proportion of subjects who subsequently develop signs and symptoms (broad 
term) within 14  days of a positive RT -qPCR test result at baseline or during the 
EAP.  
The sample  size of cohort B is based on the frequency of finding positive 
subjects while enrolling cohort A and assumes that approximately 10% of 
subjects in a household are already positive for SARS -CoV -2 by RT -qPCR at 
baseline.  A mong a pproximately 3500 adult and adolescent subjects that are 
anticipated to be  enrolled in cohort A or cohort B, the number of subjects 
expected in cohort B is approximately 220  or greater , including 200 
seronegative subjects. Assuming th at 50% of infected pla cebo subjects at 
baseline will develop symptoms, 200 seronegative subjects in cohort B will 
provide >90% power to detect a relative risk of 0.5, using a 2 -sided Fisher’s 
exact test at an alpha level of 0.05.  
Cohort B1: Pediatric Subjects  (<12 years) with SARS -CoV-2 RT -qPCR 
Positive  
Approximately up to a total of 250 pediatric subjects (<12 years) will be 
enrolled in this study.  Of 250 subjects, 10% (25/250) are expected to be 
enrolled in this cohort (ie, central lab RT -qPCR positive at baseline) for 
evalu ating the drug concentration and exposure, and safety. The actual number 
of subjects in this cohort will depend on the actual percentage of subjects with 
a baseline positive RT -qPCR enrolled. No statistical hypothesis tests will be 
performed.

confirmed negative for SARS -CoV -2 (per central lab PCR test) and who test 
negative for antibodies for SARS -CoV -2 (per central lab serology testing) at 
baseline.   
Subjects included in the administrative assessment analysis are excluded from

laboratory confirmed negative for SARS -CoV -2 (per central lab PCR test) and 
who test negative for antibodies for SARS -CoV -2 (per central lab serology 
testing) at baseline.   
Subjects will be analyzed based on the randomized treatment assignment. The

The seronegative modified full analysis set for cohort B ( seronegative  mFAS -B) 
includes all randomized subjects aged 12  years and older who have laboratory 
confirmed positive tests at baseline for SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR and negative 
SARS -CoV -2 serology (both based on central lab testing) and are asymptomatic 
at basel ine.  Subjects will be analyzed based on the randomized treatment 
assignment. The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for cohort B will be 
analyzed using the seronegative mFAS -B unless specified otherwise.  
Seronegative Modified Full Analysis Set (Ser onegative mFAS -B1) – 
Cohort  B1 
The seronegative modified full analysis set for cohort B1 ( seronegative

Subjects will be analyzed based on the randomized treatment assignment. The 
efficacy endpoint s for cohort B1 will be analyzed using the seronegative 
mFAS -B1 unless specified otherwise.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis (Cohort A)  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed in the seronegative mFAS-A 
population. In order to account for the correlation among subjects within a 
household and control the associated type 1 error inflation, a generalized linear 
model will be used to estimate the odds ratio between the treatment groups by 
using the GEE approach.  This model estimates a single within -household 
correlation coefficient. The model will include the fixed category effects of 
treatment group (placebo versus REGN10933+REGN10987), region  (US vs ex -
US), and age (≥12 to <50, ≥50 years). The model will use a compound 
symmetry covariance matrix and estimate  the odds ratio between the treatment 
groups and corresponding 95% CI and p -value.  If the GEE model fails to 
converge due to most households containing only a single study subject in

Subjects with COVID -19 symptoms that are missing a central lab determined 
RT-qPCR test during the EAP (eg. are too sick to go to the study site) but have 
a positive SARS -COV -2 test from a local lab (eg. in the hospital) will be 
considered as having a symptomatic infection if any of the symptoms occurred 
within 14 days of the positive SARS -COV -2 test.   
Additional sensitivity analyses for missing data are described in the pro tocol .

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Emergence of SARS -CoV -2 and COVID -19 
Coronaviruses  are a family of enveloped, single -stranded RNA viruses. In recent decades, two 
highly pathogenic strains of coronavirus were identified in humans: severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus (SARS -CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
(MERS-CoV). These viruses were found to cause severe, and sometimes fatal, respiratory illness 
(Cui, 2019 ) (Fehr, 2015 ). 
In December 2019, a pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in clusters of patients in 
Wuhan  City, China. A novel enveloped RNA betacorona virus – severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) – was identified in these patients, and the viral infection was later 
designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) by the World Health Organization (WHO, 
2020b ) (Zou, 2020 ).  As of June 2020, more than 7.6 million confirmed cases of COVID -19 have 
been reported globally (WHO, 2020a ). This rapidly -spreading, worldwide outbreak prompted the 
WHO to declare COVID -19 a pandemic and public health emergency of international concern on 
11 March 2020.  
1.2. Populations at Increased Risk of SARS -CoV -2 Infection Among 
Household Contacts of a Person I nfected with SARS -CoV -2 
Efforts to control the pandemic have resulted in widespread shelter -in-place orders.   Transmission 
of SARS -CoV -2 occurs primarily through person -to-person contact and respiratory droplet 
transmission (Lai, 2020 ).  Household contacts of a person infected with SARS -CoV -2 are at a high 
risk for acquiring infection, with transmission rates ranging from approximately 10% to 15%.  One 
US study reported a household attack rate of 29%, 42% among children (<18 years) of the 
SARS -CoV -2-infected patient, suggesting that children and adolescents are especially vulnerable 
to household transmission of SARS -CoV -2 (Lewis, 2020 ).  Pregnant women, in particular, are at 
increased risk for developing severe COVID -19 and have been shown to have a higher rate of 
hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation, and ICU admission than non -pregnant w omen 
(Ellington, 2020 ) (Knight, 2020 )(Woodworth, 2020 ).  Neonatal transmission of SARS -CoV -2 has 
also been reported ( Vivanti, 2020 ).  Therefore, pregn ant women should be considered for inclusion 
in COVID -19 prophylaxis efforts. Although it has been reported that the majority of individuals 
who acquire infection from household contacts develop symptoms of COVID -19 (Burke, 2020 ) 
(Jing, 2020 ), (Bi, 2020 ) (Li, 2020b ), in a cruise ship setting, the majority of persons who are 
asymptomatic at the tim e of testing remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection 
(ie, until reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR) results are negative (Sakurai, 
2020 ).  Prophylaxis is urgently needed to reduce transmission rates and/or reduce the occurrence 
of symptomatic disease.  Ideally, prophylaxis would need to be given as soon as possible  after a 
known exposure, as the duration of time between symptomatic infection in the source individual 
and the development of symptoms in newly infected individual is thought to be approximately 5 
days, with a possible range of 2  to14 days (Lauer, 2020 ) (Li, 2020a ).  Animal models suggest that 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR in nasopharyngeal (NP) samples become positive within a few days after 
infection (Rockx, 2020 ).  An ideal agent for prophylaxis should be fast acting and highly effective 
and should protect against m ultiple viral variants.  A monoclonal antibody (mAb) combination 
therapy, with two different monoclonal antibodies that bind distinct regions of the portion of the 
                                        VV-RIM-00142963-1.0 Approved - 25 Mar 2021 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  SARS -CoV -2 spike  (S) protein that bind to and facilitate entry into host cells, has been dev eloped 
in order to achieve these goals.  A mAb combination against SARS -CoV -2 for post -exposure 
prophylaxis that can either prevent the development of disease or reduce viral acquisition or viral 
load could be key to reducing transmission of the virus and limiting symptoms and adverse 
outcomes following infection.  
1.3. The Role of Spike Protein in SARS -CoV -2 Pathogenesis  
Coronaviruses consist of an RNA genome packaged in nucleocapsid (N) protein surrounded by an 
outer envelope. The envelope is comprised of membr ane (M) protein and envelope (E) protein, 
which are involved in virus assembly, and spike (S) protein, which mediates entry into host cells. 
S proteins form large trimeric projections, providing the hallmark crown -like appearance of 
coronaviruses. S protei n trimers bind to a host receptor and, after priming by cellular proteases, 
mediate host –virus membrane fusion (Li, 2016 ). The S protein appears to be central to viral 
infectivity by SARS -CoV -2. SARS -CoV -2 S protein binds the host protein angiotensin -conv erting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2) with high affinity, and in cell assays and animal models can utilize ACE2 as a 
functional receptor for host cell entry (Ou, 2020 ) (Hoffmann, 2020 ) (Walls, 2020 ).  
Blockade of host cell entry through the use of neutralizing antibodies against S protein is a viable 
mechanistic strategy shown to reduce viral infectivity of SARS -CoV and MERS -CoV (Jiang, 
2020 ). In light of the likely pivotal role of spike protein in the pathogenesis of SARS -CoV -2, a 
number of efforts are underway to develop antibodies and vaccines that target the S protein of this 
novel coronavirus.  
1.4. REGN10933+REGN10987: Fully Human Monoclonal Antibodies 
that Target SARS -CoV -2 S Protein  
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Regeneron) is currently developing fully human, neutralizing 
mAbs directed against the S protein of SARS -CoV -2, for the treatment and prevention of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection. REGN10933 and REGN10987 are fully human, IgG1 mAbs that bind to 
distinct regions of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS -CoV -2 S protein and block 
interaction w ith ACE2. REGN10933 and REGN10987 (also referred to as 
casirivimab+imdevimab) exhibit potent neutralization and can bind simultaneously to the S protein 
RBD. When co -administered as combination therapy, REGN10933+REGN10987 prophylaxis is 
anticipated to neu tralize SARS -CoV -2 with a reduced likelihood of viral escape due to genetic 
mutations. In vitro experiments designed to specifically test for viral escape under selective 
pressure have shown that the combination of REGN10933+REGN10987 was resistant to esca pe 
while some single anti -Spike protein monoclonal antibodies were vulnerable to escape. 
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy thus represents a promising prophylaxis strategy 
to reduce SARS -CoV -2 infection upon exposure to SARS -CoV -2.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1.5. A Randomized, Plac ebo-Controlled Study of Anti -Spike Protein 
Monoclonal Antibodies as Post -Exposure Prophylaxis and 
Pre-emptive Therapy in Household Contacts   
Many therapeutic agents have been studied in the context of other coronaviruses (SARS -CoV and 
MERS -CoV), including  corticosteroids, type 1 interferons, convalescent plasma, ribavirin, 
lopinavir/ritonavir, proteases, and agents targeting viral entry proteins, with generally inconsistent 
findings of efficacy (Sanders, 2020 ). Several of these therapies, as well as a number of other 
potential treatments and vaccines, are currently under investigation for the treatment of 
SARS -CoV -2.  There is currently only 1 approved treatment for COVID -19, remdesivir, approved 
for use in patients 12 years of age and older requiring hospitalization or other co mparable acute 
care setting.  Additionally, there are currently only 3 therapies for which the FDA has issued an  
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA): convalescent plasma for use in hospitalized patients, 
bamlanivimab (a monoclonal antibody against SARS -COV -2) for use in outpatients 12 years of 
age and older and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID -19 and/or hospitalization, 
and REGN10933+REGN10987 for  use in outpatients 12 years of age and older with confirmed 
mild to moderate COVID -19 who are  also at high risk for progressing to severe COVID -19 and/or 
hospitalization. Currently, however, there is no approved prophylaxis for COVID -19 nor for 
patients that are infected with SARS -CoV -2 but are asymptomatic. Given the speed at which this 
outbreak has spread and how it has impacted almost every community globally, there is an urgent 
need to develop safe and efficacious interventions to slow the spread of the SARS -CoV -2 virus 
and decrease adverse outcomes associated with symptomatic disease.  
This is a pivotal phase 3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study in adult subjects and 
pediatric subjects (<18 years of age) with household contact exposure to individuals with 
SARS -CoV -2 infection in geographic areas with an active COVID -19 outbreak. This study is 
designed to assess the efficacy and safety of co -administered REGN10933+REGN10987 
combination therapy (“REGN10933+REGN10987”) to reduce the proportion of SARS -CoV -2 
infections and prevent the development of COVID -19 disease (symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 
infection), after household exposure to individuals with SARS -CoV -2 infection. Safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of REGN10933+REGN10987 will also 
be evaluated.

program can be found i n the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).

 CONFIDENTIAL  2. STUDY OBJECTIVES   
All subjects in the study will be household contacts of the first known household member to be 
infected with SARS -CoV -2 infection (index case) but who are themselves asymptomatic (having 
no active respi ratory or non -respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID -19) at the time of 
screening.  
For analysis of endpoints, there are 4 defined cohorts based on the subjects’ SARS -CoV -2 
infection status at baseline, as measured by central lab SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR (qua ntitative 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction)  and on the subject’s age :  
1. Cohort A: adult and adolescent subjects (≥12 years) who are SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR 
negative at baseline  
2. Cohort A1: pediatric subjects (<12 years) who are SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR n egative at 
baseline  
3. Cohort B: adult and adolescent subjects (≥12 years) who are SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR 
positive at baseline  
4. Cohort B1: pediatric subjects (<12 years) who are SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive at 
baseline  
Results of the local diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2 from appropriate samples (eg NP, 
oropharyngeal [OP], or nasal or saliva) at baseline will be used as stratification factors for 
randomization and treatment group allocation, but not for the designation of cohorts for data 
analysis.  
Cohorts are d escribed in Section  3.2.3  and are  defined in Section  6.1.6 . Study objectives and 
endpoints are specified based on their SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR results at baseline: cohort A and 
cohort A1 (negative results) or cohort B and cohort B1 (positive results).   
The “strict -term” , “broad -term” , and CDC definition s for signs/symptoms of SARS -CoV -2 
infection are presented in Section  9.2.2.2 .

 CONFIDENTIAL  3. Be well -tolerated.  
Cohort B:  SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR Positive at Baseline  
Preemptive therapy with SC administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 will:  
1. Prevent the development of symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection in household contacts 
who already have a positive SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test at baseline  
2. Be well -tolerated.  
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Study Design   
This randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, phase 3 study will assess t he safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of REGN10933+REGN10987 in adult subjects and pediatric subjects 
(<18  years of age) who are household contacts of the first known household member infected with 
SARS -CoV -2 (index case). Collection of clinical and virolo gic data using a standardized timeline 
will provide valuable information on the clinical course of SARS -CoV -2 infection and the impact 
of these mAbs to prevent infection and symptomatic disease associated with SARS -CoV -2.  The 
multicenter conduct of this s tudy will enable generalizable evidence of the safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of investigational mAbs.  Specifically, this study is intended to demonstrate the efficacy 
of REGN10933+REGN10987 to prevent SARS -CoV -2 infection (with or without symptoms) i n 
uninfected subjects or prevent symptomatic disease (eg, preemptive therapy) in subjects already 
infected (ie, SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive) at baseline. The double -blind design serves to 
reduce potential bias introduced by knowing the study drug assignmen t. The comparator arm in 
this study will be placebo as no approved preventative treatments are currently available. The 
placebo arm will also provide an estimate of the background incidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection 
and disease, as well as of adverse event ( AE) rates for both efficacy and safety analyses.  
Additionally, all subjects’ SARS -CoV -2 serology status, including baseline, will also remain 
blinded to study site personnel during the study to avoid potential bias introduced when evaluating 
and assessing  subjects who are seropositive and to mitigate the possibility of less risk averse 
behaviors in which subjects might engage.  The study size and duration were driven by current 
epidemiological assumptions about study population and are detailed in Section  11.2.   
This study was preceded by safety review of data from other studies:  a safety sentinel group of 
30 adult patients with COVID -19 dosed with REG N10933+REGN10987 2400 mg IV, 
REGN10933+REGN10987 8000 mg IV or placebo in the leading phase 1 studies of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 in the treatment of COVID -19 patients. Randomization in this study 
began when the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) for the treatment studies 
provided a "study may proceed" conclusion from the IV dosing sentinel group (Section  3.2.4 ). 
All subjects in the study will be ho usehold contacts of the first known household member to be 
infected with SARS -CoV -2 (index case) but who are themselves asymptomatic  (having no active 
respiratory or non -respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID -19) at the time of screening.  
Randomization will be performed on an individual subject basis rather than by household, however 
all subjects randomized will be given a househo ld identification number in the case that multiple 
members of the same household are enrolled and receive study drug.  This ensures that correlation 
among subjects within the same household may be considered in the statistical analysis. Some of

 CONFIDENTIAL  the househo ld members of the study subjects in this study may receive EUA approved monoclonal 
antibody treatment for COVID -19 or may be participating in a separate treatment study assessing 
the efficacy of REGN10933+ REGN10987 in outpatients with  COVID -19 (study 
R1093 3-10987 -COV -2067).  Therefore, EUA monoclonal antibody treatment of household 
members, as well as information from R10933 -10987 -COV -2067 and R10933 -10987 -COV -2069 
studies will be linked , where applicable,  to assess the impact of monoclonal antibody treatme nt of 
the COVID -19 infected household members  on infectivity of study subjects .  
The study will consist of a screening/baseline period that will occur on the same day, due to the 
short window (96 hours) between the collection of the index cases’ positive S ARS -COV -2 
diagnostic test sample and randomization of the study subject(s). This same day screening/baseline 
period is expected to decrease the burden of study visits on the subject and might help to increase 
subject engagement. For the same reason, only a  subset of subjects (by subject ordinal number as 
first subjects are randomized using the interactive web response system [IWRS]) will undergo PK 
and intensive safety laboratory testing throughout the study (approximately 30 subjects for dense 
PK sampling,  approximately 400 subjects for sparse PK sampling, and intensive safety laboratory 
assessments).  The number of subjects selected for PK sampling and for intensive safety lab 
assessments are considered sufficient to provide an adequate evaluation of the d ifferent 
parameters.  
At the screening/baseline visit, subjects will have a local, diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2 from 
appropriate samples. The results of this local test will be used as a stratification factor for 
randomization for assigning subjects into  1 of 2 treatment groups. In the event that local testing 
result is not anticipated to be available in the time required during screening, subjects may be 
randomized (local test will be specified as "undetermined" in IRT).  Subjects will also have NP 
swab samples collected at baseline for central lab SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR tests. The results of the 
central lab RT -qPCR (the results of which may not be available on the same day due to time for 
shipping) will be used for cohort allocation into cohort A and cohort A1 (negative) or cohort B 
and cohort B1 (positive) for data analysis.  
Within this study, a sentinel safety group that consisted of the first 30 adult subjects who completed 
day 4 safety assessments was assessed. Subjects were observed at the study site for  4 hours after 
the single -dose SC study drug administration and were specifically monitored for acute 
hypersensitivity reactions or injection site reactions, which constitute the primary potential risks 
with SC injection of a fully human monoclonal antibod y against an exogenous target. Subjects 
were then assessed daily for the first 4 days after study drug administration for evaluation of 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESI). 
Blinded safety data was reviewe d before progressing with enrollment of additional study subjects. 
This close observation of the first 30  subjects was considered sufficient to assess safety and allow 
further enrollment of study subjects as the risk for AEs or AESIs is highest during the first days 
following study drug administration.  This sentinel safety monitoring was considered adequate 
because REGN10933+REGN10987 was already cleared by a sentinel safety group who received 
higher doses (2400 mg and 8000 mg) administered IV.  
The Blinded  Safety Data for the R10933 -10987 -COV -2069/COVID -19 Prevention Network 
(CoVPN) 3502 study was reviewed and the monitoring team met via teleconference on 
04 Aug 2020 to discuss the sentinel data.

 CONFIDENTIAL  After review of the totality of evidence the Blinded Safety D ata Review team found no reasons to 
recommend alteration or termination of the study. Study R10933 -10987 -COV -2069/CoVPN 3502 
can continue enrolment as planned per protocol.  
Available clinical safety data (including adverse experiences, AESIs, injection sit e reactions and 
hypersensitivity reactions, vital signs, and safety labs) from the first 30 subjects who received a 
single dose of 600mg REGN10933+600mg REGN10987 SC or matching placebo SC and who 
completed safety assessment visits through day 4 were revie wed. Also, laboratory results available 
to date were reviewed including samples collected through day 2 for 27 subjects, and samples 
collected through day 4 for 18 subjects.  Neither SAEs, nor AESIs were reported among the 
30 subjects. No reported injectio n site reactions or hypersensitivity reactions occurred among the 
30 subjects. There were 12 TEAEs reported in 7 subjects, all grade ≤2.  No TEAEs were deemed 
related to study drug.  There were no patterns of clinically concerning changes in vital signs or  
safety laboratory parameters among 600mg REGN10933+600mg REGN10987/placebo treated 
subjects.  In summary, treatment with 600mg REGN10933+600mg REGN10987/placebo when 
administered as a single SC dose was sufficiently well tolerated to warrant continued enr olment as 
planned per protocol.  
Inclusion of Subjects Under 18 years of Age and Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women  
Adolescent subjects (12 to <18 years) enrollment was initiated in this study because this population 
is vulnerable to infection with SARS -CoV -2 in the household (Lewis, 2020 ), and 
REGN10933+REGN10987 appears well tolerated in adults, with over 1000 adult subjects having 
already received REGN10933+REGN10987, either in the treatment studies (single dose of 
2400  mg intr avenous (IV) or 8000 mg IV [R10933 -10987 -COV -2066, 
R10933 -10987 -COV -2067]), or the prophylaxis study (1200 mg subcutaneous (SC) as a single 
dose [R10933 -10987 -COV -2069]), or the healthy subject safety study (1200 mg SC as multiple 
doses every 4 weeks (Q4W)  for 6 doses [R10933 -10987 -COV -2093]).  Upon review of  safety data 
from approximately the first 20 adolescent subjects (≥12 to <18 years of age) enrolled , pediatric 
subjects aged birth to <12 years of age will also be enrolled.  The pediatric subjects will  be 
analyzed as separate cohorts (cohort A1 and cohort B1) to assess the safety, PK, immunogenicity, 
and efficacy of REGN10933+REGN10987.  
Pregnant women and breastfeeding women are being included in this study because pregnant 
women are at increased risk of developing severe COVID -19 (Ellington, 2020 ) (Knight, 
2020 )(Woodworth, 2020 ).  The risks of REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment for pregnancy and 
a developing fetus are unknown.  Because REGN10933+REGN10987 mAb s are directed against 
an exogenous antigen, administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 is not anticipated to affect 
endogenous pathways .  Addition of pregnant women to the study is also supported by the results 
of nonclinical studies that show no changes to re productive organs in nonhuman primates and an 
absence of human tissue cross reactivity with REGN10933 or REGN10987 in human or monkey 
tissues evaluated (see the IB).  Because pregnant women are allowed in the study, contraception 
for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is no longer required as an exclusion criterion; 
however, all WOCBP will undergo pregnancy testing prior to dosing and at the end of study.  
Women who are pregnant or who become pregnant during the study will be followed for the 
outcome o f their pregnancy.  Also, because pregnant women are allowed in the study, 
contraception for men is no longer required as an exclusion criterion.  We will not solicit 
information regarding pregnancies occurring in the female partners of male study subjects  as the

 CONFIDENTIAL  risk of exposure is negligible in this scenario.  The safety profile in pediatric subjects <12 years 
and pregnant and breastfeeding women is expected to be similar to that observed in adults and 
adolescents.  Safety data is reviewed in a continuous  manner by the sponsor (blinded data) and by 
the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) (unblinded data).   
The study has a 28 -day efficacy assessment period (EAP) after the single dose of active study drug 
or placebo administered SC to capture all infect ions as detected by SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR 
positivity (both asymptomatic and symptomatic), symptomatic infection (ie, those individuals that 
experience symptoms consistent with SARS -CoV -2 infection and progression of COVID -19 
disease).  A 28 -day assessment per iod is expected to be sufficient to accrue an adequate number 
of primary endpoint events within the planned sample size.  The incubation period of SARS -CoV -2 
after exposure is approximately 2 to 14 days (Li, 2020a ) (Lauer, 2020 ).  The duration of mild to 
moderate symptoms, includ ing time to hospitalization, is approximately 11.5±5.7 days (Lechien, 
2020 ).  Following the 28 -day EAP, subjects will undergo a 7 -month follow -up period to assess for 
TEAEs, PK, and anti -drug antibodies (ADA) and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs).  This duration 
is based on a half -life of 21 -days for a typical mAb.  This follow -up period is expected to allow an 
assessment of safety after discontinuing treatment.  The length of the follow -up period may be 
modified based on the observed PK and ongoing nonclinical data as it becomes available. The 
occurrence and severity of any suspecte d COVID -19 related AEs (including SAEs) that occur as 
drug concentrations wane will be monitored, and subjects who received active drug or placebo will 
be assessed for any signal of ADE.  
3.2.2.  Subject Population  
The study population will consist of approximate ly 3500 adult and adolescent subjects and 
approximately 250 pediatric subjects <12 years old, with household contact exposure to individual 
with a confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection.  In this study, the household contact must share the same 
residence and have a close exposure to the first individual in the household with a known 
SARS -CoV -2 infection (index case).  In the case where more than 1 index case is the first known 
SARS -CoV -2 infected individual in the household (eg, 2 people are tested at the same time ), this 
is allowed, and 1 index case should be chosen, at the discretion of the investigator, to be labeled 
“index case” in the household CRF. The study was originally planned to enroll 2000 adult and 
adolescent subjects.  However, a blinded analysis of ap proximately 25% of enrolled subjects in 
this study was performed, demonstrating that higher than expected seropositivity was observed in 
cohort A.  Therefore amendment 4 for the protocol increased the sample size for the study to 
account for the higher tha n expected seropositivity in cohort A.  Amendment 5 for the protocol 
increased the sample size further to accommodate the administrative assessment of assumption 
verification and sample size estimation.  
A household is defined as a group of people who live together at the same residence and share 
multiple living spaces (eg, living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom). In case there is uncertainty 
that the characteristics of the residence meets the definition of a ‘household’, the investigator and 
the Regeneron Medical Monitor should discuss prior to randomization.  
To be included in the study, subjects must be randomized within 96 hours of collection of the index 
cases’ positive SARS -COV -2 diagnostic test sample. Household contacts of individuals infected 
with SARS -CoV -2 are at a high risk for acquiring infection, wi th transmission rates ranging from 
approximately 10% to 15% in these settings (Burke, 2020 ) (Jing, 2020 ) (Li, 2020b ). Therefore,

 CONFIDENTIAL  approximately 15% of subjects were expected to develop symptomatic disease in follow -up after 
a household contact transmission event (Li, 2020b ). A minority of subjects were expected to be 
seropositive at baseline, as seropositivity in the general population, outside of hard -hit areas like 
New York City, was expected to be less than 10% (Burke, 2020 ). Upon blinded review of 
approximately the first 25% of subjects enrolled into this study, baseline seropositivity rates in 
cohort A subjects were approximately 3 times higher than anticipated and a minority of cohort A 
subjects who became infected during the 28 day efficacy as sessment period were symptomatic.  
Subjects with positive rapid SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR at the time of randomization, who are either 
seronegative or seropositive at baseline will also be included in the study, but only subjects who 
are both seronegative and nega tive for SARS -CoV -2 infection by central lab RT -qPCR at baseline 
will be included in the primary efficacy analysis.  
3.2.3.  Enrollment by Baseline SARS -CoV -2 Infection  
This study will include asymptomatic subjects regardless of baseline SARS -CoV -2 infection statu s 
or serologic status. Including all -comers into the study will  provide important information on 
infection prevention through prophylaxis as well as the impact of pre -emptive therapy in infected 
but asymptomatic individuals.  Since the primary efficacy objective in cohort  A is focused on the 
prevention of symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection  (broad -term) , the primary population of 
interest are subjects that are seronegative and SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR negative at baseline.  It was 
estim ated that approximately 10% of the study population for cohort A would be seropositive at 
baseline.  However, blinded data review of approximately the first 25 % of subjects enrolled shows 
that approximately 30% of subjects in cohort A are seropositive at b aseline. Therefore, the majority 
of subjects enrolled are expected to be allocated to the primary study population of interest, 
seronegative and SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR negative at baseline (ie, cohort A).  
On day 1 and prior to randomization, subjects will have  a local diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2 
from an appropriate sample.  Samples will also be collected for central lab SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR 
and serology tests.  The results of the local lab tests will be available the same day and will be used 
as stratificatio n for randomization to allow administration of study drug.  In the event that local 
testing results are not anticipated to be available in the time required during screening, subjects 
may be randomized.  
For data analysis, adult and adolescent subjects will  be divided into 2 independent study cohorts: 
cohort A or cohort B. This allocation will be based on a central lab SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test 
result performed during the screening/baseline visit. While stratification and randomization will 
be based on local t est results, data analyses will be based on the central lab results of baseline 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR results from NP swab sample and the serological status.  
The analysis of the adult and adolescent subject populations that are not part of the primary study 
population of interest (ie, those subjects in cohort A who are seropositive at baseline) will not 
contribute to a primary study objective or endpoint. These individuals will be analyzed separately 
either through secondary or exploratory objectives and endpo ints.  
Adult and adolescent subjects in cohort B (ie,  asymptomatic subjects who are SARS -CoV -2 
RT-qPCR positive at baseline, irrespective of the serology status being positive or negative) will 
be analyzed separately from cohort A  with a primary study obje ctive and endpoint , secondary and 
exploratory objectives and endpoints .  The primary efficacy objective in cohort B is focused on 
the prevention of COVID -19 symptoms (broad -term) in the subjects who are seronegative but

 CONFIDENTIAL  SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive at baseline .  The analysis of the adult and adolescent subject 
populations that are not part of the primary study population of interest (ie, those subjects in cohort 
B who are seropositive at baseline) will not contribute to a primary study objective or endp oint. 
These individuals will be analyzed separately either through secondary or exploratory objectives 
and endpoints.    
Pediatric subjects (<12 years) will be divided into 2 independent study cohorts, cohort A1 or cohort 
B1. This allocation will be based o n a central lab SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test result performed 
during the screening/baseline visit.  
To mitigate enrollment of a high percentage of subjects that are either seropositive or 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive at baseline, those with a known prior history of a positive 
SARS -CoV -2 RT  PCR test, a positive serology test, or COVID -19 will be excluded.  
All subjects’ SARS -CoV -2 qualitative diagnostic and RT -qPCR test results will be unblinded 
during the study. This will ensure SARS -CoV -2 infected individuals take  the appropriate 
precautions necessary to prevent spread of disease. However, all subjects’ SARS -CoV -2 serology 
results will remain blinded to study site personnel during the study to avoid potential bias 
introduced when evaluating and assessing subjects w ho are seropositive and to avoid encouraging 
higher risk behaviors through disclosure of seropositivity.  
3.2.4.  Sentinel Safety Group and Subsequent Safety Reviews  
Driven by the medical urgency of the COVID -19 pandemic, the process described below is 
designed to  maximize efficient enrollment of eligible subjects while optimizing the safety of the 
first SC administration of REGN10933+REGN10987.  Clinical safety and tolerability data from 
the pooled sentinel cohorts from treatment studies (R10933 -10987 -COV -2066 and  
R10933 -10987 -COV -2067) in COVID -19 patients receiving IV administration of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 were available prior to first SC dosing in this study.  
A safety review of data from an adult sentinel safety group was conducted by the unblinded 
IDMC/DSMB as a  precondition for further enrollment across the REGN10933+REGN10987 
clinical development program. The sentinel group consisted of 30  subjects pooled across the 
2 treatment studies of REGN10933+REGN10987 administered as a single IV dose in patients with 
COV ID-19 (R10933 -10987 -COV -2066 and R10933 -10987 -COV -2067). Patients in this sentinel 
group were randomized to receive a single IV dose of REGN10933+REGN10987 (at 1200 mg per 
mAb, at  4000 mg per mAb), or placebo. The IDMC/DSMB approved the continuation of the  
treatment studies and the initiation of the prophylaxis study. Additionally, a blinded Sponsor 
analysis of the adult treatment study data showed that REGN10933+REGN10987 was sufficiently 
well-tolerated to warrant continued enrollment as planned per protoc ol, with no hypersensitivity 
reactions or infusion -related reactions reported. Vital signs, and laboratory assessments did not 
identify any safety signals.  
The description of the sentinel groups, safety monitoring of sentinel subjects (adult and pediatric 
[<12 years]), and data review for this study is provided in Section  6.1.1  and Section  6.1.2 . 
A blinded Sponsor analysis of the sentinel data for adult subjects in this study 
(R10933 -10987 -COV -2069) showed that REGN10933+REGN10987 was well -tolerated, with no 
hypersensitivity reactions  or injection site reactions reported. The continuous review of blinded

 CONFIDENTIAL  safety data for the study, eg, AEs, vital signs, and laboratory assessments, have not identified any 
safety signals.  
3.2.5.  Primary Objective  
The primary objective s of this study are : 
• Cohort  A:  To evaluate the efficacy of REGN10933+REGN10987 compared to 
placebo in preventing symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection (broad -term) confirmed 
by RT -qPCR  in asymptomatic subjects at risk who are  seronegative at baseline.  
• Cohort B:  To evaluate the efficac y of REGN10933+REGN10987 compared to 
placebo in preventing COVID -19 symptoms (broad -term)  in asymptomatic subjects 
that are SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive and seronegative at baseline.  
The FDA Guidance on COVID -19 recommends that in prevention trials, the pri mary endpoint 
should be the occurrence of laboratory -confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection, with or without 
symptoms. A descriptive administ rative  analysis of seronegative subjects in cohort A (n=409) 
demonstrated a 100% reduction in broad -term symptomatic PCR -positive infection with  8/223 
(3.6%) placebo treated subjects developing symptomatic infection v ersus 0/186 (0%) 
REGN10933+REGN10987 treated subjects; OR 0.00 (0.00, 0.69) p<0.01. The revised primary 
objectives and endpoints  for cohort A are informed by  these results . Thus, t hese revisions  are 
applied to objectives and endpoints for cohort B  as well . The final primary objectives  and 
endpoints f or the completed study  will be assessed in the final study population  enrolled, excluding 
those that were already unblinded and assessed in the descriptive  administrative  analysis  
(Section  11.4.9 ). Protocol amendment 6 specifies a single primary objective and endpoint  for each 
cohort which consists of the prevention of laboratory confirmed symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 
infection ( broad term) (Section  2.1.1.1  and Section  4.1.1 ).  
Clinica l efficacy : The ability of REGN10933+REGN10987 administration to prevent  
symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection (broad -term) will be evaluated through weekly inquiry by 
the investigator to assess if subjects experienced or are experiencing commonly reported clinical 
signs/symptoms related to COVID -19. A broad definition of signs/symptoms associated with 
COVID -19 (see Section  9.2.2.2  for full definition) will be utilized for the primary endpoint.  
Commonly reported symptoms of COVID -19 include fever, cough and myalgia s. However, 
SARS -CoV -2 infection has been assoc iated with a wide variety of sympto ms (eg, loss of taste and 
smell). In order to ensure all symp tomatic SARS -CoV -2 infections are captured during the study , 
a broad term definition of any one of 23 symptoms will be reported by the investigator in 
association with a laboratory confirmed SAR S-CoV -2 infection  (see Section  9.2.2.2 ).  
3.2.6.  Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives  and endpoints are informed by results of the descriptive administrative  
analysis and include the  assess ment of  laboratory  confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection  with or 
without symptoms  (strict term and CDC definition as described below) ,  the magnitude and 
duration of laboratory confirmed infection ,  and the impact of treating a COVID -19 infected 
household member with REGN10933+REGN10987 on the incidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
Clinical efficacy:  While the primary objective captures symptomatic infections defined by a 
broad-term, secondary objectives include both a  more strict definition of signs/symptoms

 CONFIDENTIAL  associated with COVID -19 and the CDC def inition (see Section  9.2.2.2  for full definitions) . Other 
secondary objectives will assess important clinical outcome measures including healthcare 
utilization (seeking an emergency room or urgent care facility, hospitalization, length of hospital 
stay, etc), the duration of disease in subjects who develop symptomatic infection, and the impact 
of index case treatment with REGN10933+REGN10987 on infection  events in the study subject 
in this study. Similar objectives will be applied to subjects who are SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR positive 
and/or seropositive at baseline (CDC, 2020b ).   
Virologic efficacy : The primary mechanism of action of REGN10933+REGN10987 is blockade 
of the S protein RBD interaction with ACE2, leading to inhibition of SARS -CoV -2 host cell 
infection. The ability of REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment to prevent SARS -CoV -2 infection 
will be e valuated by SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test results from weekly NP swab samples. Weekly 
sample collection is considered an adequate collection frequency to ensure early detection of viral 
load (SARS -COV -2 RT -qPCR positivity) in infected individuals; this is based on the average 
duration of viral positivity from NP swabs that ranges from 7 to 28 days (He, 2020 ) (Wölfel, 2020 ). 
All subjects will have SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR testing by NP sample. Nasopharyngea l swab testing 
has been shown to have good sensitivity and specificity for detecting SARS -CoV -2 RNA (Zou, 
2020 ) (Pere, 2020 ).  The administrative assessment of seronegative subjects (n=409) in cohort A 
demonstrated that the r isk of becoming infected (ie, becoming SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR positive) 
was reduced as early as the first week of study (10.3% in subjects in the placebo group versus 
5.4% in subjects in the REGN10933+REGN10987 group at day 8). The protection continued 
through the following weeks.  Both the magnitude and duration of infection were reduced by 
REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment. Infections occurring in subjects in the placebo group had, 
on average, more than 100 -fold higher peak viral load.  Infections in subjects in the 
REGN10933+REGN10987 group lasted no more than 1 week, while approximately 40% of 
infections in subjects in the placebo group lasted 3  to 4 weeks. No infected subjects  in the 
REGN10933+REGN10987 group had high viral loads (>104 copies/mL) compared to 62%  of the 
infected subjects in the placebo group (13/21 placebo v ersus 0/9 REGN10933+REGN10987)  
(CDC, 2020b) . (CDC, 2020b ) 
3.2.7.  Rationale for  Dose Selection  
This study will assess a single SC dose of REGN10933+REGN10987 as combination therapy in a 
1:1 ratio. The 1:1 ratio for REGN10933+REGN10987 is thought to be appropriate as these are 
noncompeting mAbs targeting non -overlapping epitopes of t he RBD of the S protein of 
SARS -CoV -2, with similar in vitro binding and neutralization properties (for more information, 
refer to the IB). The study will evaluate REGN10933+REGN10987 as combination therapy at a 
1200 mg (600 mg of each mAb) SC dose.  
Angio tensin converting enzyme subtype 2 expression has been reported in the lungs, particularly 
in type -2 alveolar epithelial cells and bronchial airway epithelium (Wu, 2020 ) (Xu, 2020 ) (Zhao, 
2020 ). The strategy taken for dose selection in this study was to identify a target concentration in 
lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF) that approximates the effective concentration required for 99% 
neutralization (EC 99) of SARS -CoV -2 in vitro and to then identify a dose that will meet or exceed 
this concentration in lung ELF. The EC 99 against SARS -CoV -2 in vitro is 0.14  µg/mL for 
REGN10933 and 0.80 µg/mL for REGN10987.

Clinical Study Protocol   R10933 -10987 -COV -2069 Amendment 6 
 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 68 
 CONFIDENTIAL  An average lung ELF -to-serum mean C max ratio of ~0.15 has been reported for other exogenous 
IgG1 mAbs for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus lung infections (Magyarics, 2019 ). It is 
assumed that the lung ELF -to-serum C max ratio is 0.15 for REGN10933 and REGN10987. Dividing 
the target lung ELF concentrat ion by this ratio, the associated serum concentration for these targets 
is therefore estimated to be ~at least 5 µg/mL for the combination of REGN10987+REGN10933.  
Taking into account uncertainties regarding mAb penetration into lung ELF, prediction of huma n 
PK, and effects of disease on PK, 20 µg/mL was selected as a target concentration in serum for 
subjects using the 600 mg SC per mAb REGN10933+REGN10987 combination dose. The goal 
for this REGN10933+REGN10987 combination dose is for ≥95% of subjects to ex ceed the target 
serum concentration for 28 days after dosing. To estimate the clinical SC dose required to achieve 
this goal, a population PK model developed for a typical Regeneron mAb administered SC was 
used to simulate mean and 5th percentile serum con centrations for a virtual population of 
2000  subjects (mean (SD) [min, max] body weight of 85 (17) [40, 150] kg) for various SC doses.  
For a single 600 mg per mAb SC dose, ≥95% of adult subjects are predicted to exceed the target 
serum concentration by app roximately 1 day after the first dose and remain above the target serum 
concentration for the remainder of the 28 -day treatment period, for each mAb.  
As the lower end of the proposed body weight range for adolescent subjects ≥12 years of age 
(40 kg) falls within the range of expected body weights for adult subjects, similar exposures are 
expected between these 2 populations for a single 1200 mg (600 mg of each mAb) SC dose of 
REGN10933+REGN10987.  
Similar to adults, the goal for dose selection in the pediatr ic population is for ≥95% of pediatric 
subjects within each weight -tiered group to exceed the 20 µg/mL target concentration in serum per 
mAb for 28 days after dosing. An additional consideration was to select doses for pediatric subjects 
that would achieve  exposures within the range of those shown to be generally safe and well 
tolerated in adults.  
The same 2 -compartment population PK model with linear clearance developed for adults was 
used to simulate concentrations in serum over time for various doses in each pediatric 
weight -tiered group using allometrically scaled estimates of clearance and volume of distribution 
(gestational -age corrected allometrically scaled estimates were used for subjects <10 kg) (Robbie, 
2012 ). The doses selected are predicted to result in ≥95% of subjects within each weight tier 
exceeding  the 20 µg/mL target concentration in serum per mAb for 28 days after dosing ( Table  1). 
Compared to predicted 95th percentiles of C max and AUC 0-28 for REG N10933 and REGN10987 in 
adults after a single SC dose of 1200 mg (600 mg per mAb), the 95th percentiles of predicted C max 
and AUC 0-28 across the different pediatric weight -tiered groups ranged from 18% to 88% higher 
than in adults, but lower than observed mean C max and AUC 0-28 values for the lowest single IV 
dose (2.4 g) with an acceptable safety profile in adults with COVID -19.  For children <  10 kg, SC 
administration is not deemed feasible, and it is assumed that the concentration -time profile of 
REGN1093 3 and REGN10987 will be similar for intramuscular (IM) and SC administration.

A 4-week GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted and assessed once weekly 
dosing of up to 150/150 mg/kg per mAb administered once weekly (for combination) to support 
safety of the anti -SARS -CoV -2 spike mAbs.  Throughout the 4 -week dosing p eriod the 
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination was well tolerated at all dose levels, with no drug -related or 
adverse effects evident  (for more information, refer to the IB).  
3.3. Risk -Benefit  
This study represents the initial prophylaxis study planned to evaluate REGN10933+REGN10987 
as a SC injection in humans. Therefore, the potential clinical benefits and risks associated with the 
study drugs are yet to be determined. Several preclinical pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic, and 
toxicology studies are ongoing and/or pl anned, and findings from these studies will be 
appropriately communicated. While preclinical data are available (discussed below), the 
anticipated risks are based primarily on prior Sponsor experience with s imilar fully human 
monoclonal antibody developmen t programs against exogenous targets and the potential risks 
associated with subcutaneous injection of fully human monoclonal antibodies in general.  
The positive efficacy results observed for REGN10933+REGN10987 administered IV to 
symptomatic patients with  COVID -19 in R10933 -10987 -COV -2067 study are balanced by an 
acceptable safety profile.  Nonclinical toxicology studies in nonhuman primates showed that 
REGN10933+REGN10987 was well -tolerated without adverse findings.  Moreover, review of 
available clinical  data from the 3 ongoing clinical studies (R10933 -10987 -COV -2066, 
R10933 -10987 -COV -2067, R10933+REGN10987 -HV-2093) show that there are currently no 
identified risks with REGN10933+REGN10987. There are several potential risks, which are 
described below.  
A 4-week GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys is currently ongoing and assessing 
once -weekly IV and SC dosing of REGN10933+REGN10987 at up to 150 mg/kg per antibody. 
Findings from the completed 4 -week dosing period of the toxicology study identified no  clinically 
relevant risks or test article -related adverse effects and no changes to reproductive organs in 
nonhuman primates. Separately, findings from 2 tissue cross reactivity studies was notable for by 
the absence of any tissue cross reactivity with ei ther REGN10933 or REGN10987 in any of the 
human or monkey tissues or human fetal tissues evaluated.  Reproductive and developmental 
toxicology studies have not been conducted; therefore, the effects of REGN10933, REGN10987, 
and REGN10933+REGN10987 combinat ion therapy on the fetus and reproductive organs in males 
and females are unknown.  
REGN10933 and REGN10987 target the SARS -CoV -2 S protein, an exogenous protein. The 
Sponsor has significant experience with prior development programs for fully human mAbs 
against exogenous targets, including atoltivimab, odesivimab, and maftivimab (Ebola), 
REGN3048 and REGN3051 (MERS -CoV), REGN5713, REGN5714 and REGN5715 (Bet v 1

 CONFIDENTIAL  birch tree allergen), and REGN1908 and REGN1909 (Fel d 1 cat dander allergen). No significant 
safety findings were observed in any of the associated toxicology studies conducted and the mAbs 
demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in the clinical studies.  
Important Potential Risks:   The important potential risks are those typically associated with a 
mAb administered by SC route: injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, 
immunogenicity, and potential embryo -fetal toxicity (see the IB). REGN10933 and REGN10987 
are fully human IgG1 mAbs, and correspondingly the risk of injection site reacti ons, 
hypersensitivity reactions, or immunogenicity is expected to be low.  However, given the limited 
experience with these mAbs and the evolving understanding of SARS -CoV -2 infections, all 
TEAEs will be collected during the study to adequately characteriz e the safety profile of 
REGN10933+REGN10987.  Clinical safety and tolerability data from the pooled sentinel cohorts 
from treatment studies (R10933 -10987 -COV -2066 and R10933 -10987 -COV -2067) in COVID -19 
patients receiving IV administration of REGN10933+REGN 10987 were available prior to first SC 
dosing in this study.  These data showed that a single IV dose of REGN10933+REGN10987 or 
placebo (at 1200 mg per mAb, at 4000 mg per mAb) was well -tolerated, with no hypersensitivity 
reactions or infusion -related reac tions reported. Vital signs and laboratory assessments did not 
identify any safety signals (Section  3.2.4 ).  Protein therapeutics carry the potential risk of an 
immunogenic response in the form of ADA and NAb development following administration, with 
possible consequences on safety and efficacy. Therefore, blood samples for immunogenicity 
assessment will be co llected during the studies.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have not been conducted; therefore, the 
effects of REGN10933, REGN10987, and REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy on the 
fetus and reproductive organs in males and females ar e unknown. Human immunoglobulin G1 
(IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier and are present in breast milk; therefore, 
the REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy have the potential to be transferred from the 
mother to the developing fetu s or a breastfed child. Given the high affinity and specificity of 
REGN10933 and REGN10987, off -target pharmacological effects are not anticipated in either the 
mother, the fetus, or breastfed child and no off -target binding of REGN10933 or REGN10987 was 
observed in any of the human or monkey tissues evaluated ex vivo in tissue cross -reactivity studies.  
However, it is unknown whether the potential transfer of the combination of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 therapy provides any treatment benefit or risk to the develo ping fetus 
or breastfed child.  
There is currently limited clinical experience in the use of REGN10933, REGN10987, and 
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy in female subjects who are pregnant or 
breastfeeding. The combination of REGN10933+REGN10987 thera py should be used during 
pregnancy or breastfeeding only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother 
and the fetus or breastfed child considering all associated health factors. If a female subject is 
pregnant or were to become preg nant while receiving REGN10933+REGN10987 combination, 
the pregnancy should be followed until outcome and any safety issue observed get reported.  
Other Theoretical Considerations: Antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE) has also been 
observed for some therape utics targeting exogenous viral proteins. For antibody therapies, ADE is 
thought to occur when binding of antibody to the target viral protein enhances FcγR -mediated host 
cell entry of the virus (Iwasaki, 2020 ). This could potentially lead to worsening of disease and, in 
the case of SARS, acute lung injury (Liu, 2019 ).  REGN10933 and REGN10987 retain the Fc

 CONFIDENTIAL  region, as this may play a role in protecting against viral infection (Yasui, 2014 ). However, there 
is no strong evidence of ADE in other coronavirus models (Kam, 2007 ) (Liu, 2019 ) (Luo, 2018 ) 
(Wang, 2016 ) (Weingartl, 2004 ). To date, Fc -containing mAbs developed by the Sponsor for Ebola 
virus, and MERS -CoV have demonstrated specificity to their exogenous targets with no significant 
unexpected safety findings in preclinical or clinical studies.  All subjects will be monitored for 
TEAEs during the drug elimination period.  Theoretical risks of administration of the 
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination include interference with the subject’s endogenous 
immune response  to either SARS -CoV -2 infection or vaccination against SARS -CoV -2.   
With respect to efficacy, the currently available in vitro data (see the IB) show that 
REGN10933+REGN10987 is anticipated to be pharmacologically active at the planned dose, with 
expected  neutralization and effector functions against the SARS -CoV -2 S protein. Additionally, 
the only control measures that are currently available against this virus is practicing rigorous 
infection control. There is no therapeutic option for the prevention of SARS -CoV -2 infection and 
there is an urgent need for a preventative treatment given the wide reaching, devastating effects of 
this global outbreak (Woodworth, 2020 ).   
Emerging data suggest that the pediatric population is equally vulnerable to SARS -COV -2 
infection and may contribute significantly to transmission (Szablewski, 2020 ) (Lewis, 2020 ) 
(Viner, 2020 )and that pregnant women are at increased risk for developing severe COVID -19 and 
have been shown to have a higher rate of hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation, and ICU 
admission than non -pregnant women (Ellington, 2020 ) (Knight, 2020 )(Woodworth, 2020 ).  
Neonatal transmission of SARS -CoV -2 has also been reported (Vivanti, 2020 ). Therefore, all 
adults and children should be considered for inclusion in COVID -19 prophy laxis efforts.  
In summary, based on prior experience with other fully human mAbs against exogenous targets, 
the available clinical and nonclinical data for REGN10933+REGN10987 to date, and the unmet 
need for a preventative therapy in advance of an approve d vaccine, it is the opinion of the Sponsor 
that the overall risk -benefit balance for REGN10933+REGN10987 is acceptable to allow 
evaluation of this mAb combination in all populations, including adults, pregnant and 
breastfeeding women, and children who are  household contacts of an infected individual and 
therefore at high risk for SARS -CoV -2 infection.

6. STUDY DESIGN  
6.1. Study Description and Duration  
This is a phase 3 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study in adults, adolescents, and 
children with household contact exposure to individuals with SARS -CoV -2 infection. This study 
is designed to assess the efficacy of the administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 to reduce the 
incidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection and prevent the development of disease (symptomatic 
SARS -CoV -2 infection) after household exposure to individuals with SAR S-CoV -2 infection.  
Safety, tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity of REGN10933+REGN10987 will also be evaluated.  
Eligible subjects are those who are asymptomatic and household contacts with close exposure with 
the first household member with known SARS -CoV -2 infection (index case) but may be either 
positive or negative for SARS -CoV -2 during screening, as assessed by central laboratory 
RT-qPCR performed at baseline.  The index case will have a diagnosis of SARS -CoV -2 infection 
using a diagnostic test, eg, RT -PCR, antigen test, or other test format (approved or with EUA 
issued by the US FDA or by equivalent local health authority). Randomization will be performed 
by individual study subjects, not by households.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Approximately 3500 adult and adolescent subjects a nd approximately 250 pediatric subjects 
<12 years old will be enrolled.  Randomization will be performed by site and stratified for 
assignment of treatment group by test result of a local diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2 from 
appropriate samples and age gro up (<12 years, ≥12 years to <18 years, ≥18 to <50 years, or 
≥50 years) (Section  8.4).  For pediatric subjects (<12 years), the weight group (≥20 kg, ≥ 10 kg to 
<20 kg, and <10 kg) will be used as an additional stratification factor. Cohort allocation will be 
based on central lab baseline SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR for data analysis: cohort A or cohort A1 
(negative) and cohort B or cohort B1 (positive) (defined i n Section  6.1.6 ).  For adult and adolescent 
subjects, approximately 3150  subjects are planned to be enrolled in cohort A and 350 subjects in 
cohort  B.  A t least 1248 cohort A subjects are expected to be seronegative and available for primary 
and secondary endpoint analysis  (Section  11.2.1 ), excluding those cohort A subjects that were 
included in the administrative assessment . The subjects that are included the planned  analys es are 
described in Section  11.4.9 . For pediatric subjects (<12 years), approximately 225  subjects are 
planned to be enrolled in cohort A1 and  25 subjects in cohort B1. Statistical analyses will be 
conducted separately in each cohort.  For the purpose of the study analysis, cohorts A, A1, B, and 
B1 are independent.  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups (placebo or 
REGN10933+REGN10987) (Section  8.1). 
Adult subjects were enrolled into the first 2 subgroups and then adolescents were added to 
subgroup 3, as subgroups 1 and 2 had completed enrollment at the time the protocol was amended  
to add adolescents.  Subjects are assigned a subject number by IWRS (irrespective of allocation to 
cohort A or cohort B) ( Table  4): 
1. Sentinel group (subs et 1; first 30 adult subjects; completed) had samples collected in the 
EAP and Follow -Up periods for clinical laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry, 
urinalysis), drug concentration measurement (dense, PK), and immunogenicity analysis 
(ADA).  
2. Safety group (subset 2; 31st to 400th adult subject; completed) had samples collected in the 
EAP and Follow -Up periods for clinical laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry, 
urinalysis), drug concentration measurement (sparse, PK), and ADA.  
3. All other subjects (subset 3; 401st to last subject) will have samples collected at baseline 
and end of EAP for clinical laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis) and 
ADA.  
Pediatric subjects (<12 years) will be enrolled into 2 subgroups by subject n umber assigned by 
IWRS (irrespective of allocation to cohort A1 or cohort B1) ( Table  6).   
1. Pediatric subject sentinel group (subset 4; first 12 subjects (6 active, 6 placebo); 4 per 
weight group (≥20 kg, ≥10 kg to <20 kg, and <10 kg) completed) will have samples 
collected (Schedule A) in the EAP and Follow -Up periods for clinical laboratory tests 
(hematology, blood chemistry), drug concentration measuremen t, and ADA.  
2. All pediatric subjects (subset 4 and subset 5) will have samples collected (Schedules A, B, 
C, and D) in the EAP and Follow -Up periods for clinical laboratory tests (hematology, 
blood chemistry), drug concentration measurement, and ADA.

6.1.1.  Sentinel Subjects and Staggered Enrollment/Dosing:  
Enrollment into this study was gated by IDMC review of a sentinel group of 30 adult patients with 
COVID -19 dosed w ith REGN10933+REGN10987 2400 mg IV, REGN10933+REGN10987 
8000  mg IV or placebo in leading phase 1 studies of REGN10933+REGN10987 (Section  3.2.4 ). 
Enrollment in this study was carried out in 2 phases:  
1. Sentinel group comprised ~30 adult subjects (by subject number assigned by IWRS; 
irrespective of allocation to cohort A or cohort B):  S ubjects were monitored for safety 
on-site for a minimum of 4 hours after administration of the first dose of study drug and 
then daily via visits to the study site or phone calls for the first 4 days (96  hours). Because 
REGN10933+REGN10987 will already hav e cleared an adult safety sentinel cohort at 
higher doses administered IV in previous studies (Section  3.2.4 ), the sentinel group in this 
study focused  on safety evaluation for injection site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions 
and data were reviewed before progressing with enrollment of additional study subjects. 
The blinded safety data review was be led by a designated member of the Regeneron 
                                        VV-RIM-00142963-1.0 Approved - 25 Mar 2021 GMT-5:00

minimum the data review team included the Regeneron Medical Monitor, Study 
Biostatistician, Global Safety Lead or designee, and the Senior Vice President of Early 
Clini cal Development & Experimental Sciences.  
2. Following a conclusion of the blinded safety data review that the study could proceed, the 
study resumed enrollment.  
In case of any safety concerns, the IDMC/DMSB may be consulted and requested to provide 
recommenda tions.  
6.1.2.  Pediatric Subjects (<12 years)  
Approximately 250 pediatric subjects (<12 years) across all weight -tiered dose ranges will be 
enrolled.  However, since the enrollment of pediatric subjects (<12 years) will end once enrollment 
of adult and adolescen t subjects is complete, the number of pediatric subjects may be adjusted.  
Enrollment of pediatric subjects in this study will be carried out in 2 steps, one for safety and 
another for confirmation of drug exposure for each weight group.  
Pediatric Subject s Safety Sentinel Group  
1. Sentinel group (subset 4) will comprise 12 pediatric subjects (by subject number assigned 
by IWRS; irrespective of allocation to cohort A1 or cohort B1) in 3 weight groups (≥20  kg; 
10 kg to <20 kg; <10 kg).  Each weight group will h ave 4 subjects randomized 1:1 to 1 of 
2 treatment groups (placebo or REGN10933+REGN10987) and study drug administered 
first.  After all 4  subjects in a weight group complete the sentinel review, enrollment of 
additional subjects in that weight group will p roceed.  Pediatric subjects (<12 years) will 
be monitored for safety on -site for a minimum of 2  hours after administration of the first 
dose of study drug and then daily via visits to the study site or phone calls for the first 
4 days (96  hours). Because R EGN10933+REGN10987 will already have cleared an adult 
safety sentinel cohort at higher doses administered IV in previous studies (Section  3.2.4 ), 
and the adult safety sentinel as well as the first 20 adolescent subjects (≥12 to <18 years) 
in this study, the pediatric (<12  years) sentinel group in this study is focused on safety 
evaluation for injection site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions and d ata will be 
reviewed before progressing with enrollment of additional pediatric subjects. The blinded 
safety data review will be led by a designated member of the Regeneron clinical team 
(generally either the medical monitor or the clinical trial manager) and at a minimum the 
data review team will include the Regeneron Medical Monitor, Study Biostatistician, 
Global Safety Lead or designee, and the Senior Vice President of Early Clinical 
Development & Experimental Sciences.  
2. Following a conclusion of the blin ded safety data review that the study may proceed for a 
weight group, the enrollment of pediatric subjects in that weight group will resume; 
however, close monitoring by the Safety Review Committee will continue on a periodic 
cumulative aggregate basis, in cluding stratification to facilitate early and periodic review 
of data for adolescent subjects (≥12 years to <18 years) and pediatric subjects (<12 years) 
in each of the weight groups.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. All pediatric subjects (subset 4 and subset 5) will have samples collected (Schedules A, B, 
C, and D) in the EAP and Follow -Up periods for drug concentration measurement as well 
as ADA assessment and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry).  Th e drug 
concentration data from approximately the first 20 subjects per weight group (<10 kg, 10  to 
20 kg, ≥20 kg) will be evaluated to confirm that the REGN10933 and REGN10987 dose 
for the weight group is providing the expected exposure.   
2. Based on simulations using a population PK model using data from adult patients with 
COVID -19, the proposed doses for the pediatric subjects ( Table  2) is expected  to match 
the exposure in adult subjects at SC dose of 1200 mg (600 mg per mAb) in this study.  
Once the exposure for a dose is confirmed in a weight group, enrollment beyond 25 subjects 
for this weight group can continue.  Based on the results of the drug  concentration analyses 
from up to 20 pediatric subjects receiving active drug in the weight groups, the dose for 
participating pediatric subjects may be adjusted in 1 or more of the weight group(s) to 
ensure drug exposure comparable to adult subjects in t his study. If the dose for a particular 
weight group needs to be adjusted, the new dose for that weight group will used for 
approximately a subsequent 20 subjects for that weight group.  These subjects who 
received the new dose will have drug concentration s analyzed to confirm that it is providing 
the expected exposure.  When the new dose is started, the subjects will resume dosing 
according to the next sample collection schedule since the last subject received study drug.  
6.1.3.  Screening/Baseline  
After subjects provide informed consent, they will be assessed for study eligibility.  The screening 
visit and randomization visit should occur on the same day.  If needed, a remote visit may occur 
to sign the ICF and collect medical history and concomitant medication us e, on the day prior to, 
but within 24 hours of study drug administration, so that the in person screening and randomization 
visit may be abbreviated, due to COVID -19 considerations. Study drug administration must occur 
within 96 hours of the sample collect ion of the index cases’ positive SARS -CoV -2 diagnostic test 
sample.  Subjects will be provided with contact information for the clinical study site and will be 
given written and verbal instructions to call site personnel with  any changes in their health st atus. 
On day 1, prior to randomization, a local diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2 (SARS -CoV -2 antigen 
or RT -PCR) from appropriate samples will be performed (details in Section  9.2.1.2 ).  The result 
of this assay will be used as a stratification factor for randomization to treatment groups (placebo 
or REGN10933+REGN10987) ( Section  8.4).  The requirement for a local diagnostic assay for 
SARS -CoV -2 is waived when the results are not expected to be available in a timely manner for 
randomization.  Nasopharyngeal swab sample (sw abbing through both nostrils) for central lab 
testing of SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR and blood sample for central lab serology will be collected and 
sent to central lab.  After completing baseline assessments and sample collection, all subjects will 
receive a singl e-dose of study drug (see details of study drug administration in Section  8.1).  The 
central lab results of baseline SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR will be used to allocate subjects into cohort 
A (negative result) or cohort  B (positive result).  
Subjects will be monitored for vital signs and TEAEs after study drug administration as follows:  
• Adult subjects in the sentinel group (subset 1; completed)  were monitored i n the 
clinic for at least 4  hours after study drug administration on day 1 and then daily by 
phone call or site visit until day 4 (96 hours).

 CONFIDENTIAL  • Adult subjects in the safety group (subset 2; completed)  were monitored in the clinic 
every hour for 2 hours after  study drug administration and by a phone call on day 4.  
• All other adult and adolescent subjects (subset 3)  will be monitored in the clinic for 
1 hour after study drug administration.  
• Pediatric subjects (<12 years) in the sentinel group (subset 4)  will be monitored in 
the clinic for at least 2  hours after study drug administration on day 1 and then daily by 
phone call or site visit until day 4 (approximately 96 hours).  
• All other pediatric subjects (<12 years) (subset 5)  will be monitored in the clinic for 
1 hour after study drug administration.  
All subjects will be advised to call the site if signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity occur.  During 
post-dose monitoring, Grade 3 or greater injection site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions that 
occur after stud y drug administration will be captured as an AESI to allow for expedited reporting 
to the sponsor (see AE grading system in Section  10.2.4  and list of AESIs in Section  10.1.3 ).  
6.1.4.  Efficacy Assessment Period  
Efficacy, safety, sample collections, and other study assessments will be performed at specified 
time points throughout the EAP according to the Schedule  of Events specified in Section  9.1. On 
day 1/baseline with study drug administratio n, sample collection must occur prior to study drug 
administration.  
If subjects are able to travel and can do so while maintaining social distancing guidelines, 
subsequent site visits will be conducted; alternatively, telemedicine visits, phone calls, mobi le 
units or home health nurses may be utilized.  Throughout the study, biological samples will be 
obtained by adequately trained and delegated study personnel at study locations where appropriate 
personal protective equipment (PPE) are available to be used . 
At each weekly visit, assessments and procedures will be performed ( Table  3 and Table  4). 
Subjects will be instructed to contact the study site staff for any new or changing symptoms or 
signs possibly related to COVID -19, including fever .  The investigator should recommend that 
subjects (themselves or  by their parent/guardian) measure their temperature daily during EAP, 
approximately  at the same time , and also every time when the subject feels feverish, chills, or sick  
(Section  10.1.1 ).  Adult subjects may receive automated reminders (eg, text messages to mobile 
phones; implemented as soon as technologically feasible and when subjects confirm to opt in ) in 
between the weekly visits to prompt them to contact the study site staff as needed.  The NP swab 
sample will be collected for SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR to be tested at the central lab.  The 
investigator or designee will contact each subject weekly (site visi t or telemedicine) to assess the 
subjects general health, and to document AEs in general and any signs and symptoms associated 
with SARS -CoV -2 infection since the last contact (see details of the procedure in Section  9.2.2.2 ). 
Any subject who develops fever, an acute respiratory illness, symptoms related to multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome in children ([ MIS-C] [pediatric subjects <18 years only ]), or ot her 
symptoms that they may feel could be related to COVID -19 should alert the study staff 
immediately.  If the subject experiences a true medical emergency, they should visit their local 
hospital ED or call the local emergency telephone number (eg, 911 in North America) and contact 
the clinical site personnel later.  Subjects’ symptoms must be evaluated by the investigator or 
                                        VV-RIM-00142963-1.0 Approved - 25 Mar 2021 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  designee, which can occur through site visit, mobile unit, home visit, telemedicine, etc. If 
investigator or designee suspects SARS -CoV-2 infection, a NP swab sample should be collected 
and sent for central lab testing. The subject may also be asked to provide blood samples if it 
corresponds to a scheduled visit, according to the Schedule of Events (specified in Section  9.1). 
Subjects with laboratory confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection should be informed as soon as possible 
and should undergo medical isolation to prevent contact with othe rs to reduce the risk of further 
transmission. Since these subjects will likely be isolated, the study visits, assessments and sample 
collections may occur through a variety of methods.  For subjects who have a confirmed 
SARS -CoV -2 infection, the investiga tor will assess AEs weekly or more frequently than weekly, 
depending on the clinical status of the subject, as assessed by the investigator or designee (these 
more frequent AE assessments will be reported as unscheduled visits).  The investigator will also  
collect information for any SARS -CoV -2 infection -related medically attended visits to the ED, 
UCC, or hospitalization starting from the timepoint of SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive result (see 
detail in Section  9.2.2.3 ). 
For subjects who are positive for SARS -CoV -2 at any time during the EAP, including those 
positive at baseline, subsequent assessments/sample collections in the EAP should follow that 
speci fied in Table  3 until 2 consecutive confirmed negative SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test results 
are achieved ≥24 hours apart.  A PK sample and an ADA sample will be collected (1) as soon as 
possible or within 7 days  of receiving first positive SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR result for cohort A 
subjects and (2) as soon as possible or within 7 days of first new positive SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR 
resul t after achieving 2 consecutive negative results for all subjects.  
Subjects presenting with acute illness should be medically managed according to local standard of 
care as per the discretion of the treating physician.  
If a subject is hospitalized for susp ected COVID -19, every effort should be made by the site 
personnel to collect, as soon as possible, a NP swab sample for central lab SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR 
testing. In subjects where it is not possible to have samples collected for assessment in the central 
laboratory, study site personnel will attempt to obtain and record information about all 
SARS -CoV -2 assays conducted in other medical facilities, including result(s), name of the assay(s) 
and whether the laboratory(ies) conducting the assays is a CLIA (Clinic al Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments) certified (or equivalent) laboratory. The laboratory report for a 
positive SARS -CoV -2 test result , including the name of the test as well as information about 
laboratory certification , should be collected and stored as  source documentation at the site. The 
positive SARS -CoV -2 assay result will be recorded in concomitant procedures  related to the 
COVID -19 AE . Details on any symptoms and medically attended visits will also be collected. 
After discharge, as described above , all subjects with a positive SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR will 
continue to follow the weekly planned study visits until 2 confirmed negative SARS -CoV -2 
RT-qPCR test results are achieved at least 24 hours apart.   
6.1.5.  Follow -up Period  
Subjects who remain SARS -CoV -2 RT-qPCR negative throughout the EAP will complete the end 
of the EAP and enter the Follow -up Period  to be followed for 7 months ( Table  3, Table  4). 
Subjects who become SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive during the EAP will continue t o have 
weekly NP swab samples for SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR tests until 2 confirmed negative

 CONFIDENTIAL  SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test results are achieved at least 24  hours apart, even after they complete 
the EAP and enter the study Follow -up Period to be followed for 7 months.  In such situations, 
these visits for sample collection in the Follow -up Period should be characterized as unscheduled 
visits.  A PK sample and an ADA sample will be collected (1) as soon as possible or within 7 days  
of receiving first positive SARS -CoV -2 RT-qPCR result for cohort A subjects and (2) as soon as 
possible or within 7 days of first new positive SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR result after achieving 
2 consecutive negative results for all subjects.  
At each scheduled visit, the investigator or designee will con tact each subject (site visit or 
telemedicine) to assess and document the subject’s general health, AEs in general and signs and 
symptoms associated with SARS -CoV -2 infection, including fever, since the last contact, as 
described for the EAP (Section  6.1.4 ).  For subjects who have a confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection, 
the investigator will assess AEs weekly or more frequently than weekly, depending on the cl inical 
status of the subject, as assessed by the investigator or designee (these more frequent AE 
assessments will be reported as unscheduled visits).  The investigator will also collect information 
for any SARS -CoV -2 infection -related medically attended v isits to the ED, UCC, or 
hospitalization starting from the timepoint of SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive result (see details 
in Section  9.2.2.3 ). 
Any subjec t who, between the study visits, develops fever, an acute respiratory illness, symptoms 
related to MIS -C (pediatric subjects <18 years only), or other symptoms that they may feel could 
be related to COVID -19 should alert the study staff immediately. If the  subject experiences a true 
medical emergency, they should visit their local hospital ED or call the local emergency telephone 
number (eg, 911 in North America) and contact the clinical site personnel later.  The subjects’ 
symptoms must be evaluated by the  investigator or designee, which can occur through site visit, 
mobile unit, home visit, telemedicine, etc. If the investigator or designee deems the subject’s 
signs/symptoms require the collection of biological samples for central lab testing to assess or 
confirm SARS -CoV -2 infection, the subject will be advised to provide NP sample. The subject 
may also be asked to provide blood samples if it corresponds to a scheduled visit, according to the 
Schedule of Events (specified in Section  9.1). If a subject is hospitalized for suspected COVID -19, 
every effort should be made by the site personnel to collect, as soon as possible, a NP swab sample 
for central lab SARS -CoV -2 RT-qPCR  testing. In subjects where it is not possible to have samples 
collected for assessment in the central laboratory, stu dy site personnel will attempt to obtain and 
record information about all SARSCoV -2 assays conducted in other medical facilities, including 
result(s), name of the assay(s) and whether the laboratory(ies ) conducting the assays is a CLIA 
certified (or equiva lent) laboratory.  The laboratory report for  a positive SARSCoV -2 test result , 
inclu ding the name of the test as well as information about laboratory certification , should be 
collected and stored  as source documentation at the site. The positive SARS  CoV -2 assay result 
will be recorded as concomitant procedures  related to the COVID -19 AE . Details on any symptoms 
and medically attended visits will also be collected.  
6.1.6.  Description of Study Cohorts

6.1.7.  Study S topping Rules  
6.1.7.1.  Study Stopping Criteria  
The IDMC, which may also be referred to Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), will 
monitor unblinded data on a regular basis to assess the risk/benefit profile of 
REGN10987+REGN10933. If at any time the IDMC has sig nificant concerns regarding a 
meaningful imbalance in TEAEs or treatment -emergent SAEs, including in relation to safety data 
by pediatric groups, the IDMC may make a recommendation to the Sponsor to halt the study or 
make recommendations for other changes in the study conduct. This will prompt a review by the 
Sponsor who will decide to implement, modify, or reject the recommendation. Applicable 
regulatory procedures will be adhered to as required by local laws in relation to any decisions 
related to a chang e in study conduct, temporary halt, study termination, or study restart.   
Pre-specified stopping rules for early termination (ET) of the study for efficacy will be documented 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) and IDMC Charter.  
6.1.8.  End of Study Definition  
The end of study is defined as the date the last subject completes the last study visit, withdraws 
from the study, or is lost to follow -up (ie, the study subject can no longer be contacted by the 
investigator).

There is no interim  analysis  planned  after the administrative assessment.    
6.3. Study Committees  
6.3.1.  Independent Data Monitoring Committee/Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
The terms IDMC and DSMB employed during the conduct of this study refers to the safety 
committee that will per form safety monitoring for this study and the terms are interchangeable in 
this protocol.  
The IDMC/ DSMB,  will be utilized to evaluate the safety of REGN10933+REGN10987 on a 
regular basis. The IDMC/DSMB is important for this prophylaxis study, given the li mited amount 
of safety data currently available, and because the study will enroll a large number of adults. The 
IDMC/DSMB may also be asked to perform a formal interim evaluation of efficacy (Section  11.5) 
and/or sample size re -estimation to be conducted when 25% of the originally planned number of 
subject complete the EAP (Section  11.2.1 ). The details of such evaluation will be described in the 
IDMC/DSMB Charter.  
6.3.2.  Safety Review Committee for REGN 2069/ CoVPN 3502  
The Safety Review Committee (SRC) for REGN 2069/CoVPN 3502 will i nclude Regeneron 
members (Medical/Study Director(s), Global Patient Safety, and Biostatistics and Data 
Management), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) members (Medical 
Officers), and CoVPN members (Protocol Chairs, and the CoVPN Physician.  The CoVPN is 
supported by NIAID. The SRC for 2069/CoVPN 3502 will be utilized to evaluate the safety of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 on a regular basis.  Safety monitoring will be performed for blinded 
data on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs and AESIs) and on a periodic cumulative 
aggregate basis, including stratification to facilitate early and periodic review of data for 
adolescent subjects (≥12 years to <18 years), pediatric subjects (<12 years), and pregnant and 
breastfeeding subjects .  The details of the safety monitoring will be described in the SRC for 
2069/CoVPN 3502 safety monitoring collaborative plan.

 CONFIDENTIAL  7.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A subject or pediatric subject’s parent/guardian has the right to withdraw from the study at any 
time, for any reason, and without repercussion.  
The investigator and/or Sponsor have the right to withdraw a subject from the study if it is no 
longer in the interest of the subject to continue in the study, or if the subject’s continuation in the 
study places the scientific outcome of the  study at risk (eg, if a subject does not or cannot follow 
study procedures).  An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; 
therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided.  
Subjects who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete the ET visit, as 
described in Section  9.1.5 . 
7.4. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects prematurely discontinued from study will not be replaced.  
8. STUDY TREATMENTS  
8.1. Investigational and Reference Treatments  
The following drug product will be provided. Instructions on dose preparation are provided in the 
pharmacy manual.  
REGN10933 and REGN10987, to be co -administered:  
• REGN109 33:  Supplied as a 120 mg/mL solution for SC or IM injection  
• REGN10987:  Supplied as a 120 mg/mL solution for SC or IM injection  
Matching placebo:   
• Supplied as matching solution for SC or IM injection.  
All adult or adolescent subjects will receive 4 SC injections of study drug on day 1, each injection 
containing 2.5 mL of active study drug or placebo.  The REGN10987 and REGN10933 dose is 
1200 mg (600 mg of each mAb) SC single dose on day 1.  
Pediatric subjects (<12 years of age) will receive between 1 to 4 SC or IM injections of study drug, 
active or placebo, depending on the weight -tiered dose group on day 1 ( Table  2). Subjects <5 kg 
should not receive an  injection with more than 1 mL, subjects between 5 and 10 kg should not 
receive an injection with more than 1.25 mL.  Subjects <10 kg may receive IM injection(s)at the 
discretion of the investigator, as children less than 10 kg have smaller amounts of subc utaneous 
tissue and IM injection may be better tolerated than SC.  In addition, in children <10 kg, the 
combined volume containing both mAbs may be administered in a single syringe.   The total 
volume of study drug per syringe and the number of injections w ill be recorded in the CRF. For 
subjects who weigh ≥10  kg, study drug may be administered SC using an infusion pump, 
containing the combined volume containing both mAbs, which may improve tolerability of 
administration as only 1  injection may be required.

1.  Investigators have the option to use an infusion pump for SC administration of study drug containing the 
combined volume with both mAbs.  
2.  If the Investigators prefers not to exceed 1 mL per syringe, then study drug may be administered using 2 syringes 
for each mAb (ie, 4 injections), one with 0.8 mL and another with 0.9 mL for each mAb. If the Investigator prefers 
to use only 2 syringes (ie, 2 injections), the 1.7 mL administered in each syringe will contain a different mAb.   
3.  Investigators have the option to administer the dose in a single syringe containing the combined volume with 
both mAbs.  
4.  If the Investigator prefers not to e xceed 1 mL per syringe, then study drug may be administered using 1 syringe 
for each mAb.  If the Investigator prefers to use 1 syringe, the1.2 mL administered in 1 syringe should be 
combined volume of 0.6 mL of each mAb.  
For study drug administration whic h requires multiple SC injections, it is recommended to use 
different quadrants of the abdomen (avoiding navel and waist areas) and upper thighs.  During the 
dose administration, each injection must be given in a different anatomical location (eg, 1 inject ion 
administered in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, another in the left lower quadrant of the 
abdomen, etc).  For pediatric subjects (<12 years) only, a numbing cream may be used at the 
planned site(s) of injection.  Adolescent (≥12 years) and adu lt subjects should not use numbing 
cream at the sites of injection as this will interfere with the safety assessment, ie, evaluation of 
injection site reactions.   
A pharmacist or qualified personnel at the site, not otherwise associated with the conduct of the 
study, will prepare the drug for SC administration or IM administration. The prepared syringe must 
be provided in identical form for active and placebo treatments, so that they remain 
indistinguishable to both study personnel and subject. Details fo r study drug administration are 
provided in the pharmacy manual.  
8.2. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
8.2.1.  Dose Modification  
This is a single dose study; dose modification is not allowed.

 CONFIDENTIAL  8.3. Management of Acute Reactions  
8.3.1.  Acute Injection Reactions  
8.3.1.1.  Systemic Injection Reactions  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of systemic reactions must be available 
for immediate use.  All injection reactions must be reported as AEs (as defined in Section  10.2.1 ) 
and graded using the grading scales as instructed in Section  10.2.4 . 
Acute systemic reactions following  injection of study drug (subcutaneous [SC])  should be treated 
using clinical judgment to determine the appropriate response according to typical clinical practice.  
8.3.1.2.  Local Injection Site Reactions  
Local injection site reactions must be reported as AEs and graded according to Section  10.2.4 . 
8.4. Method of Treatment Assignment  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive REGN10987+REGN10933 or placebo 
according to a central randomization sch eme provided by an interactive web response system 
(IWRS) to the designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee).  Randomization will be 
performed by individual study subjects, not by households.  In addition to a randomization number, 
all subjects ran domized will be given a household identification number in the case that multiple 
members of the same household are enrolled and receive study drug.  This ensures that any 
correlation among subjects within the same household may be considered in the statis tical analysis.  
The REGN10987 and REGN10933 dose for adult, adolescent, and pediatric subjects is described 
in Section  8.1. 
Randomization will be performed by site and stratified as follows:  
• Local diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2 from appropriate samples (positive, negative, 
or undetermined)  
• Age and/or weight:  
− <12 years and <10 kg,  
− <12 years and ≥10 kg to <20 kg,  
− <12 years and ≥20 kg  
− ≥12 years and <18 years  
− ≥18 years and <50 years  
− ≥50 years  
Note that the cohorts used in the analysis are defined by the baseline central lab SARS -CoV -2 
RT-qPCR results, not by the local diagnostic assay.

 CONFIDENTIAL  8.5. Blinding  
Study subjects, the principal investigators, and study s ite personnel will remain blinded to all 
randomization assignments throughout the study.  The Regeneron Medical/Study Director, Study 
Monitor, and any other Regeneron and contract research organization (CRO) personnel who are 
in regular contact with the st udy site s will remain blinded to all subject randomization assignments.  
No interim analyses  were conducted (Section  11.5) and an unblinded administrative assessment of 
study assumptions  (Section  11.2) was conducted . No study personnel involved in the day -to-day 
conduct of the study will ha ve access to any subject -level unblinded data before the final database 
is locked for this study .  
Anti-drug antibody, drug concentration results, and central  lab serology results will not be 
communicated to the sites. The Sponsor’s blinded study team will  not have access to post -baseline 
results associated with subject identification until after the database is locked for the respective 
study part.  
8.6. Emergency Unblinding  
Unblinding of treatment assignment for a subject may be necessary due to a medical emer gency 
or any other significant medical event and when a treatment decision is contingent on knowing the 
subject’s treatment assignment.  
• If unblinding is required:  
− Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment.  
− Only the af fected subjects will be unblinded.  
− The designated study pharmacist(s)/designee at the study site will provide the 
treatment assignment to the investigator.  If there is no study pharmacist, the 
investigator for the site will unblind the subject. Unblinding  is performed using the 
IVRS/IWRS which will notify Regeneron.  
• The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee as soon as possible after 
unblinding the subject  for safety or other important medical decisions, however, 
unblinding performed for the purpose of COVID -19 vaccine decision making does

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.1.1.  Schedule of Events Table 3 (Cohorts A and B [Adult / Adolescent Subjects], 
RT-qPCR -Negative and Positive) Footnotes  
1. The screening v isit and baseline visit should both occur on the same day. If needed, a 
remote visit may occur to sign the ICF and collect medical history and concomitant 
medication use, on the day prior to, but within 24 hours of study drug administration, so 
that the in -person screening and randomization visit may be abbreviated, due to COVID -19 
considerations. Study drug administration must occur within 96 hours of collection of the 
index cases’ positive SARS -CoV -2 diagnostic test sample.  
2. The sentinel group (see Section  6.1.1 ) had additional safety monitoring on day 1 and 
through day 4.  
Vital signs: On day 1, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and 
respiratory rate) will be measured at predose, approximately every 30 minutes during the 
first 2 hours after dose, at hour 3, and at hour 4 before dismissal.  
Adverse Events (injection site reactions and hypersensitivity):  after the administration 
of the first dose of study drug, subjects will be monitored on site for a minimum of 4  hours 
and then by daily visits to the study site or phone calls for the first 4 days (96  hours), 
particularly focusing on the assessment of injection site reactions and hyper sensitivity after 
study drug administration.  
3. Subjects who have a positive RT -PCR result during screening, or who have a positive 
RT-qPCR result any time after screening, will have the additional assessments done as 
indicated ( RT-qPCR positive subjects only ). A PK sample and an ADA sample will be 
collected (1) as soon as possible or within 7  days of receiving first positive SARS -CoV -2 
RT-qPCR result for cohort A subjects and (2) as soon as possible or within 7 days of first 
new positive SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR re sult after achieving 2 consecutive negative results 
for all subjects.  
For subjects who become RT -qPCR positive after screening, the visit schedule will proceed 
as follows: (a) If the positive RT -qPCR result is from a scheduled visit for sample 
collection, the next weekly visit will occur as planned.  (b) If the positive RT -qPCR result 
is from an unscheduled sample collection (eg, between scheduled visits) but within the 
window (±3 days) of the next weekly visit, this visit will be recorded as the scheduled next 
weekly visit.  (c) If the positive RT -qPCR result is from an unscheduled sample collection 
(eg, between scheduled visits) and not within the window (±3 days) of the next weekly 
visit, this visit will be recorded as an unscheduled visit, and the next w eekly visit will occur 
as planned.  
4. Unscheduled visits: If, at any time after randomization until end of study , a subject 
develops fever, an acute respiratory illness or other symptoms they may feel could be 
related  to COVID -19 or is hospitalized for suspected COVID -19, the subject or 
parent/guardian (adolescent  pediatric subject) should alert the investigator or designee 
immediately who will assess the subject’s symptoms and condition (can be performed by 
phone contact, telemedi cine, online meeting, home health care, etc ) to decide if the subject 
should have an unscheduled visit  for collection of NP swab sample for RT -qPCR testing.  
The subject or parent/guardian (adolescent  pediatric subject) may also be asked to provide 
                                        VV-RIM-00142963-1.0 Approved - 25 Mar 2021 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  blood s amples if it corresponds to a scheduled visit, according to  the Schedule of Events 
(specified in Section  9.1).  The investigator or designee should que ry the subject about AEs 
in general and AEs consistent of COVID -19 and record the information on CRF (see 
detailed description of the procedure in Section  9.2.2.2 ). 
(a) If the positive RT -qPCR result is from a scheduled visit for sample collection, the next 
weekly visit will occur as planned.  (b) If the positive RT -qPCR result is from an 
unscheduled sample collection (eg, between scheduled visits) but w ithin the window 
(±3 days) of the next weekly visit, this visit will be recorded as the scheduled next weekly 
visit.  (c) If the positive RT -qPCR result is from an unscheduled sample collection 
(eg, between scheduled visits) and not within the window (±3 d ays) of the next weekly 
visit, this visit will be recorded as an unscheduled visit, and the next weekly visit will occur 
as planned.  
5. Visit may occur by phone or electronic means  
6. Separate consent (adult subject or parent/guardian of adolescent pediatric sub ject)/pediatric 
assent is required for participation in the optional genomic sub -study and collection of 
blood samples for DNA and RNA. The sample for RNA, should be collected on day 
1/baseline (pre -dose). Genomic DNA should be collected on day  1/baseline.  If not 
collected at baseline, the sample for genomic DNA may be collected at any visit.  
7. Sample for diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2 (local lab) (see Section  9.2.1.2 ) and 
RT-qPCR (NP swab; central lab) should be collected before administration of study drug. 
Samples for RT -qPCR (NP swab) will be collected by swabbing through both nostrils 
(see Section  9.2.2.1 ). The remnant samples may additionally be used for exploratory viral 
RNA sequencing and viral infectivity analyses.  The requirement for a local diagnostic 
assay for SARS -CoV -2 may be waived if the results are not expected to be available in a 
timely manner for randomization.  
8. Study drug should be administered after all biological samples at screening/baseline have 
been collected.  
9. Subjects who are RT -qPCR positive at the end of the EAP will contin ue to have samples 
collected weekly (NP swab; central lab) for RT -qPCR.  Subjects will continue 
assessments/sample collections until 2 negative RT -qPCR test results have been obtained 
≥24 hours apart (all samples must be negative).  Subjects who are RT -qPCR negative at 
the end of the EAP will have samples collected only if they become symptomatic with 
COVID -19 in the follow -up period.  If a subject is hospitalized for suspected COVID -19, 
every effort should be made by the site personnel to collect, as soon a s possible, a NP swab 
sample for central lab SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR testing. In subjects where it is not possible 
to have samples collected for assessment in the central laboratory, study site personnel will 
attempt to obtain and record information about all SARS -CoV -2 tests conducted in local 
laboratories associated with other medical facilities , including result(s), name of the 
assay(s)  and whether the laboratory(ies) conducting the assays is a CLIA certified (or 
equivalent) laboratory . The positive test res ult should be recorded as concomitant 
procedures.

 CONFIDENTIAL  10. For subjects who are not in the sentinel group (subset 1; completed), vital signs will be 
monitored on site as follows: Safety group (subset 2; completed): at baseline predose and 
then every hour for 2 hours after study drug administration and a phone call on day 4 to 
assess AEs, specifically injection site reactions and hypersensitivity; all other subjects 
(subset 3): at baseline and 1  hour after study drug administration.  All subjects will be 
advised to call the site if signs/symptoms of injection site or hypersensitivity reactions 
occur.  If the subject experiences a true medical emergency, they should visit their local 
hospital ED and contact the site personnel later.  
11. The investigator may perform a t argeted physical exam, request an exam and/or vital signs 
at any time.  These assessments can be performed using a clinic visit or a remote visit with 
the investigator or sub -investigator, or designee (ie, nurse practitioner in countries where 
allowed by l ocal law).  
12. For all women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and girls at or beyond menarche, except 
subjects with a confirmed pregnancy .  If the local urine pregnancy test is positive, the site 
must perform a serum pregnancy test for confirmation.  
13. Samples for drug concentration and, immunogenicity, and laboratory testing will be 
collected based on the subject subset designation as indicated in Table  4 
14. The serology test results will not be communicated to the sites. The sponsor’s blinded study 
team will not have access to post -baseline results associated with subject identification 
until after the database is locked . 
15. During each scheduled or unscheduled visi t/contact, the investigator or designee will query 
subject about AEs in general (see Section  10.1.1) and evaluate if the AEs are associated 
with SARS -CoV -2 infection, including fever (see Section  9.2.2.2 ).  The investigator should 
recommend that subjects (themselves or by their parent/guardian) measure their 
temperature daily during EAP, approximately at the same time, and also every time when 
the subject feels feverish, chills, or sick.  Subjects with symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 
infection should be queried on their symptoms weekly until symptoms resolve, even during 
follow -up period, then follow the regular schedule.  
16. The information for the household assessment, including household members wh o receiv e 
an EUA approved monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID -19 or household members 
participating in the R10933 -10987 -COV -2067 study, should preferably be collected at the 
baseline visit. There will be a follow -up assessment at day 29.  
17. All subjects will have a weekly NP swab sample collected during the EAP.  Only subjects 
who are RT -qPCR positive will continue to have weekly NP swab samples collected during 
the follow -up period until 2 consecutive negative (≥24 hr) RT -qPCR results or the end of 
study  visit.  
18. Only for RT -qPCR positive subjects (cohort A and cohort B): Complete assessments from 
the time the subject first becomes RT -qPCR positive or from the time they develop 
symptoms suspected to be COVID -19 (later confirmed by RT -qPCR positive results)  until 
the subject has had 2 negative tests or COVID -19 related symptoms have resolved 
(whichever lasts longer), or until the end of study visit.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.1.3.  Schedule of Events Table 5 Cohorts A1 and B1 (Pediatric Subjects [ <12 years], 
RT-qPCR -Negative and Positive) Footnotes  
1. The screening visit and baseline visit should both occur on the same day. If needed, a 
remote visit may occur to sign the  ICF and collect medical history and concomitant 
medication use, on the day prior to, but within 24 hours of study drug administration, so 
that the in -person screening and randomization visit may be abbreviated, due to COVID -19 
considerations. Study drug a dministration must occur within 96 hours of collection of the 
index cases’ positive SARS -CoV -2 diagnostic test sample.  
2. The pediatric sentinel group (subset 4) (see Section  6.1.2 ) will have additional safety 
monitoring on day 1 and through day 4.  
Vital signs: On day 1, vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate, body temperature and blood 
pressure [if feasible, according to the child’s age]) will be measu red at predose, 
approximately every 30 minutes during the first 2 hours after dose before dismissal.  
Adverse Events (injection site reactions and hypersensitivity):  after the administration 
of the first dose of study drug, subjects will be monitored on sit e for a minimum of 2  hours 
and then by daily visits to the study site or phone calls for the first 4 days (96  hours), 
particularly focusing on the assessment of injection site reactions and hypersensitivity after 
study drug administration.  
3. Pediatric subjec ts who have a positive RT -PCR result during screening, or who have a 
positive RT -qPCR result any time after screening, will have the additional assessments 
done as indicated ( RT-qPCR positive pediatric subjects only ).  A PK sample and an 
ADA sample will be  collected (1) as soon as possible or within 7  days of receiving first 
positive SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR result for cohort A1 pediatric subjects and (2) as soon as 
possible or within 7 days of first new positive SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR result after 
achieving 2 consec utive negative results for all pediatric subjects.  
For pediatric subjects who become RT -qPCR positive after screening, the visit schedule 
will proceed as follows: (a) If the positive RT -qPCR result is from a scheduled visit for 
sample collection, the next weekly visit will occur as planned.  (b) If the positive RT -qPCR 
result is from an unscheduled sample collection (eg, between scheduled visits) but within 
the window (±3 days) of the next weekly visit, this visit will be recorded as the scheduled 
next week ly visit.  (c) If the positive RT -qPCR result is from an unscheduled sample 
collection (eg, between scheduled visits) and not within the window (±3 days) of the next 
weekly visit, this visit will be recorded as an unscheduled visit, and the next weekly vis it 
will occur as planned.  
4. Unscheduled visits: If, at any time after randomization until end of study , a pediatric 
subject develops fever, an acute respiratory illness or other symptoms they may feel could 
be related  to COVID -19 or is hospitalized for suspe cted COVID -19, the pediatric subject 
and/or parent/guardian should alert the investigator or designee immediately who will 
assess the subject’s symptoms and condition (can be performed by phone contact, 
telemedicine, online meeting, home health care, etc ) to decide if the pediatric subject 
should have an unscheduled visit  for collection of NP swab sample for RT -qPCR testing.

 CONFIDENTIAL  The pediatric subject and/or parent/guardian may also be asked to provide blood samples 
if it corresponds to a scheduled visit, accord ing to  the Schedule of Events (specified in 
Section  9.1).  The investigator or designee should query the subject and/or 
parents/guardians about AEs in  general and AEs consistent of COVID -19 and record the 
information on CRF (see detailed description of the procedure in Section  9.2.2.2 ). 
(a) If the p ositive RT -qPCR result is from a scheduled visit for sample collection, the next 
weekly visit will occur as planned.  (b) If the positive RT -qPCR result is from an 
unscheduled sample collection (eg, between scheduled visits) but within the window 
(±3 days)  of the next weekly visit, this visit will be recorded as the scheduled next weekly 
visit.  (c) If the positive RT -qPCR result is from an unscheduled sample collection 
(eg, between scheduled visits) and not within the window (±3 days) of the next weekly 
visit, this visit will be recorded as an unscheduled visit, and the next weekly visit will occur 
as planned.  
5. Visit may occur by phone or electronic means  
6. Sample for diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2 (local lab) (see Section  9.2.1.2 ) and 
RT-qPCR (NP swab; central lab) should be collected before administration of study drug. 
Samples for RT -qPCR (NP swab) will be collected by swabbing a single nostril 
(see Section 9.2.2.1 ). The remnant samples may additionally be used for exploratory viral 
RNA sequencing and viral infectivity analyses.  The requirement for a  local diagnostic 
assay for SARS -CoV -2 may be waived if the results are not expected to be available in a 
timely manner for randomization.  
7. Study drug should be administered after all biological samples at screening/baseline have 
been collected.  
8. Pediatric s ubjects who are RT -qPCR positive at the end of the EAP will continue to have 
samples collected weekly (NP swab; central lab) for RT -qPCR.  Pediatric subjects will 
continue assessments/sample collections until 2 negative RT -qPCR test results have been 
obtai ned ≥24 hours apart (all samples must be negative).  Subjects who are RT -qPCR 
negative at the end of the EAP will have samples collected only if they become 
symptomatic with COVID -19 in the follow -up period.  
9. All other pediatric subjects (subset 5) will hav e additional safety monitoring on day 1 at 
baseline and 1  hour after study drug administration.  All pediatric subjects or their 
parent/guardian will be advised to call the site if signs/symptoms of injection site or 
hypersensitivity reactions occur.  If t he pediatric subject experiences a true medical 
emergency, they and their parent/guardian should visit their local hospital ED and contact 
the site personnel later.  
10. The investigator may perform a targeted physical exam, request an exam and/or vital signs 
at any time.  These assessments can be performed using a clinic visit or a remote visit with 
the investigator or sub -investigator, or designee (ie, nurse practitioner in countries where 
allowed by local law).  
11.  For all girls at or beyond menarche .  If the lo cal urine pregnancy test is positive, the site 
must perform a serum pregnancy test for confirmation.

 CONFIDENTIAL  12. Samples for drug concentration, immunogenicity, laboratory testing, serology, and 
pharmacogenomics sub -study will be collected based on the pediatric subje ct subset 
designation as indicated in Table  6. 
13. The serology test results will not be communicated to the sites. The sponsor’s blinded study 
team will not have access to post -baseline results associated with pediatric subject 
identification until after the database is locked . 
14. During each scheduled or unscheduled visit/contact, the investigator or designee will query 
the pediatric subject and/or parent/guardi an about AEs in general (see Section  10) and 
evaluate if the AEs are associated with SARS -CoV -2 infection (see Section  9.2.2.2 ). 
Pediatric subjects and/or parent/guardian with symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection should 
be queried on their symptoms weekly until symptoms resolve, even during follow -up 
period, then follow the regular schedule.  
15. The information for the household assessment,  including household members who 
receiv ed EUA approved monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID -19 or household 
members  participating in the R10933 -10987 -COV -2067 study should preferably be 
collected at the baseline visit. There will be a follow -up assessment at day 29.  
16. All pediatric subjects will have a weekly NP swab sample collected during the EAP.  Only 
pediatric subjects who are RT -qPCR positive will continue to hav e weekly NP swab 
samples collected during the follow -up period until 2 consecutive negative (≥24 hr) 
RT-qPCR results or the end of study visit.  
17. Only for RT -qPCR positive subjects (cohort A1 and cohort B1): Complete assessments 
from the time the subject fi rst becomes RT -qPCR positive or from the time they develop 
symptoms suspected to be COVID -19 (later confirmed by RT -qPCR positive results) until 
the subject has had 2 negative tests or COVID -19 related symptoms have resolved 
(whichever lasts longer), or un til the end of study visit.  
18. All pediatric subjects and/or parent/guardian will complete the TEAE assessment weekly 
during the EAP.  Subjects who are RT -qPCR negative will complete the TEAE assessment 
monthly during the follow -up period.  Pediatric subject s and/or parent/guardian who have 
symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection will complete the TEAE assessment weekly during 
the follow -up period until the COVID -19 related symptoms resolve after which the 
pediatric subject and/or parent/guardian will complete the T EAE assessment monthly until 
the end of study visit.  
19. Separate consent (parent/guardian of pediatric subject)/pediatric assent is required for 
participation of pediatric subjects who weigh ≥10 kg in the optional genomic sub -study 
and collection of blood sam ples for DNA and RNA.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.1.4.  Schedule of Events Table 6: Cohorts A1 and B1 (Pediatric Subjects [<12 years]) 
for Drug Concentration, Immunogenicity, and Laboratory Testing  
1. Samples should be collected before the administration of study drug. Administration of 
study drug must be performed on the on same day as sample collection.  
2. Actual dosing time and sample collection times will be recorded for PK -ADA samples.   
3. At the screening/baseline visit, the window for baseline pre -dose PK -ADA sample 
collection is as close to administr ation of study drug as is reasonable.  
4. Whole blood samples for hematology and blood chemistry will be analyzed at central lab.  
5. Pediatric subjects who prematurely discontinue the study should have sample collection 
listed in the ET visit before exiting the s tudy.  
6. A PK -ADA serum sample will be collected as soon as possible or within 7  days of 
receiving the first positive SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR result for cohort A pediatric subjects.  
7. A PK -ADA serum sample will be collected as soon as possible or within 7 days of fi rst 
new positive SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR result after achieving 2 consecutive negative results 
for all pediatric subjects.  
8. Serum samples for serology will be collected at baseline and day 29.  For pediatric subjects 
<10 kg, the serum sample for serology on the day 29 visit will not be collected due to 
restrictions in total blood volumes collection.  For pediatric subjects <3 kg, the serum 
sample for serology on the baseline and day 29 visit will not be collected due to restrictions 
in total blood volumes collect ion.  
9. The PK -ADA serum samples may be analyzed for ADA and NAb, if feasible.  
10. Only for pediatric subjects who weigh ≥10 kg:  The whole blood sample for RNA, should 
be collected on day 1/baseline (pre -dose).  The whole blood for genomic DNA should be 
collect ed on day  1/baseline. If not collected at baseline, the sample for genomic DNA may 
be collected at any visit.  
9.1.5.  Early Termination Visit  
Subjects  who are withdrawn from the study will be asked to provide final blood samples for drug 
concentration and immunogenicity analysis.  
9.1.6.  Unscheduled Visits  
All attempts should be made to keep subjects on the study schedule.  Unscheduled visits may be 
necessary t o repeat testing following abnormal laboratory results, for follow -up of AEs, for 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR and serology testing when subjects experience symptoms consistent with 
SARS -CoV -2 infection (per the broad -term list specified in Section  9.2.2.2 ), or for any other 
reason, as warranted.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.2. Study Procedures  
This section describes the procedures and collections that will be performed in this study. 
Procedures  and collections will occur according to the schedule of events ( Table  3 and Table  4). 
9.2.1.  Procedures Performed Only at the Screening/Baseline Visit  
The following pr ocedures will be performed for the sole purpose of determining study eligibility 
or characterizing the baseline population: demographics (eg, age, sex, race, weight, height, etc), 
medical history, local diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2, query for risk facto rs for SARS -CoV -2 
infection (eg, first responder or healthcare worker; presence in outdoor or indoor crowed or public 
places [without keeping distance >6 feet] in the last 14 days, with or without a mask and/or eye 
protection; attendance to any social even ts with more than 10 people in the last 14 days, with or 
without a mask and/or eye protection; exposure to someone believed to have COVID -19; exposure 
to someone diagnosed with COVID -19; receipt of influenza vaccine as of July 2020), and 
household assessme nt in which subjects will be asked to provide general information about the 
household members (including their general demographic information, COVID -19 status, their 
risk of exposure to COVID -19, and treatment with an EUA approved monoclonal antibody 
treatment for COVID -19). 
9.2.1.1.  Informed Consent  
Informed consent (adults and parents/guardians) and pediatric assent must be obtained according 
to the requirements described in Section  13.2. Optional informed consent may be obtained for 
participation in the pharmacogenomics sub -study (refer to Section  9.2.7  for more information on 
this sub -study  or inclusion in the R10933 -10987 -COV -2067 study ). 
9.2.1.2.  Local Diagnostic Assay for SARS -CoV -2  
The investigator or sub -investigator will verify that the subjects tests negative or positive by a local 
diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2 (eg, molecular assay such as RT -PCR assay for SARS -CoV -2 
or a SARS -CoV -2 antigen test using an appropriate sample such as NP, nasal, OP, or sal iva). The 
local diagnostic assay for SARS -CoV -2 must be considered acceptable for clinical use by local 
standards. If the test has not been approved or received EUA issued by the US FDA or by the 
equivalent local health authority, then the Sponsor should b e consulted. The use of a RT -PCR 
assay is highly recommended.  
The local diagnostic test result, specimen type (eg, nasal swab), assay type, and date of test will be 
recorded in the CRF. The sample type collected is dependent on local lab requirements.  
9.2.2.  Efficacy Procedures  
9.2.2.1.  Nasopharyngeal Swab SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR Test (Central Lab)  
Nasopharyngeal swab sample will be collected from subjects to determine presence or absence of 
SARS -CoV -2 virus and to determine the relative quantification of viral load.  For adu lt and 
adolescent subjects (≥12 years of age), NP swab samples will be collected by swabbing through 
both nostrils on all planned timepoints ( Table  3). For pediatric subjects (<12 years of age), NP 
swab samples will be collected by swabbing through a single nostril on all planned timepoints

 CONFIDENTIAL  (Table  5).  Detailed instructions for sample collections are in the laboratory manual provided to 
study sites.   
9.2.2.2.  COVID -19 Symptomology (Strict Terms, Broad Terms, and CDC Definition)  
During each scheduled or unscheduled visit/contact, the investigator or sub -PI investig ator, or 
designee (ie, nurse practitioner in countries where allowed by local law) will query the subject 
and/or subject’s parent or guardian about adverse events the subject is experiencing or has 
experienced since the last visit/contact (eg,  within the p rior week if it is a weekly scheduled visit) 
and ask about all of the signs and symptoms associated with these adverse events including the 
start date, end date and severity of each. The investigator should avoid querying the subject and/or 
subject’s paren t or guardian by running a check -list of signs and symptoms, but rather allow the 
subject and/or subject’s parent or guardian to spontaneously report everything that they presented.  
All signs and symptoms related to the AEs, along with the corresponding s tart date, end date and 
severity should be documented in the subject’s medical records (source document). As signs and 
symptoms may appear and resolve on different days and may precede or occur after the collection 
of NP swab sample for the SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR test, it is important that this detailed 
information be captured in the source document.  
Independent of the results (positive or negative) of the SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR tests performed 
on samples collected from study subjects during the weekly or unschedul ed visits, all adverse 
events must be documented in the AE CRF . Signs and symptoms related to the adverse events 
reported in the AE CRF and confirmed to be temporally related to a positive SARS -CoV -2 
RT-qPCR test collected from the subject’s NP swab sample  will be reported on a separate CRF 
(individual sign or symptom with start date and end date, and associated severity).  
For the purpose of the study’s primary and secondary objectives, the  assessment of association of 
symptomatic disease with SARS -CoV -2 infection (ie, diagnosis of strict term COVID -19, broad 
term COVID -19, and CDC definition of COVID -19) will be based on the strict term , broad term , 
and CDC  COVID -19 definitions described below ( Table  7) and the temporal relationship of the 
signs and symptoms with lab confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection  (based on central lab RT -qPCR 
test result).    
Temporal Relationship of Signs and Symptoms with Positive RT -qPCR for Diagnosis of 
COVID -19 
The onset date of signs/symptoms will utilize a ±14 days window from the date of the positive 
SARS -CoV -2 RT-qPCR, so long as the signs/symptom onset does not precede a negative 
SARS -CoV -2 RT-qPCR test. That is, the onset date o f symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection is 
defined as the date of the first sign/symptom that is consistent with a diagnosis of COVID -19 as 
determined by the investigator. The onset date must be after the last negative SARS -CoV -2 
RT-qPCR and no more than 14 day s prior to the first positive SARS -CoV -2 RT-qPCR or must 
occur on or before 14 days after the last positive SARS -CoV -2 RT-qPCR.  
Definitions  of COVID -19 Signs and Symptoms used for the Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints :  
1. Strict term:  as described in Section  4.1.2  and  Section  4.2.2  , a secondary endpoi nt will 
utilize a strict definition of signs and symptoms of COVID -19 (see Table  7).

utilize a broad term COVI D-19 signs and symptoms defined as any of the 23 symptoms 
listed in Table  7 or fever (≥38°C).

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.2.3.  Assessment of Medically Attended Visits  
Only for RT -qPCR positive subjects (cohort A, cohort A1, cohort B, and cohort B1): Subjects 
and/or their parent/guardian (as appropriate) who are or become SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR positive 
will be queried on any SARS -CoV -2 infection -related medically attended visits to the ED, UCC, 
or hospitalization ( Table  3 and Table  5).  The assessment of medically attended visits to ED, UCC 
or hospitalization  will be performed from the time the subject first becomes SARS -CoV -2 
RT-qPCR positive or from the time they develop symptoms suspected to be COVID -19 (later 
confirmed by RT -qPCR positive results) until the subject has had 2 negative tests or COVID -19 
related symptoms have resolved (whichever lasts longer), or until the end of study visit. Details 
associated with any SARS -CoV -2 infection -related medically -attended visit will be recorded and 
will include at minimum:  
• Nature of the visit (ED, UCC, hospital sta y) 
• Date and length of visit  
• Primary reason for the visit should be recorded as an adverse event  
• Assessment of the following parameters or occurrences (worst or most abnormal 
finding) during the medically attended visit/stay:  
− Abnormal vital signs: respirato ry rate ≥30 per minute, heart rate ≥125 per minute, 
peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤93% on room air at sea level, or 
oxygen partial pressure (PaO2)/fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) <300  mm Hg)  
Note:  these limits for abnormal vital signs a re for adult and adolescent subjects.  
− Respiratory failure: needing high -flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, 
mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)  
− Evidence of shock: systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mm Hg, diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP) <60 mm Hg, or requiring vasopressors  
Note:  these limits for abnormal vital signs are for adult and adolescent subjects.   
− Multiorgan dysfunction: Significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction  
− Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in c hildren (MIS -C)  
Note:  for pediatric subjects <18 years only  
− Admission to an ICU  
9.2.2.4.  Absenteeism Assessment  
Only for RT -qPCR positive subjects (cohort A, cohort A1, cohort B, and cohort B1): Subjects 
and/or their parent/guardian who are or become SARS -CoV -2 RT-PCR positive during the EAP 
will be queried on any SARS -CoV -2 infection -related absenteeism ( Table  3 and Table  5). 
Absenteeism is defined as number of days missed for daily responsibilities, including work 
(employed adults) or school (students), daycare, or family obligations/responsibilities (childcar e 
or eldercare).  The assessment of absenteeism will be performed from the timepoint the subject 
first becomes SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR positive until the end until the subject has had 2 negative 
tests or COVID -19 related symptoms have resolved (whichever lasts longer), or until the end of 
study visit.

 CONFIDENTIAL  9.2.3.  Safety Procedures  
9.2.3.1.  Targeted Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
The targeted physical examination and vital signs include measurements of temperature, blood 
pressure (measured after the subject has been resting quietly for at least 5 minutes and may be 
obtained from a seated or supine position), pulse rate, and respiratory rate, and examination of the 
oropharynx, skin, heart, lungs and any other system(s) depending on any complaints or concerns 
expressed by the s ubjects.  
Vital signs consisting of blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate will be 
collected pre -dose and after dose administration as follows:  
• Sentinel group (subset 1; completed):   approximately every 30 minutes during the 
first 2 hours after study drug administration, at hour 3, and at hour 4 before dismissal.  
• Safety group (subset 2; completed) :  approximately every hour for 2 hours after study 
drug administration.  
• All other adult and adolescent subjects (subset 3) :  approximat ely 1 hour after study 
drug administration.  
• Pediatric sentinel group (subset 4):  approximately every hour for at least 2 hours 
after study drug administration (blood pressure will be measured, if feasible, 
according to the child’s age).  
• All other pediatric  subjects (subset 5):  approximately 1 hour after study drug 
administration (blood pressure will be measured, if feasible, according to the child’s 
age).  
9.2.3.2.  Laboratory Testing  
Samples for laboratory testing will be collected at visits according to the Schedule  of Events 
Table  4 and Table  6.  Samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory.  For pediatric subjects 
(<18  years) only, a numbing  cream may be used for blood sample collection.  Detailed instructions 
for blood sample collection are in the laboratory manual provided to study sites.

study drug. If a subject has a positive urine pregnancy test, a serum pregnancy test should be 
performed to confirm.   
Abnormal Laboratory Values and Laboratory Adv erse Events  
All laboratory values must be reviewed by the investigator or authorized designee.  
Significantly abnormal test results that occur after start of treatment may be repeated to confirm 
the nature and degree of the abnormality.  When necessary, app ropriate ancillary investigations 
should be initiated.  If the abnormality fails to resolve or cannot be explained by events or 
conditions unrelated to the study medication or its administration, the Medical/Study Director must 
be consulted.  
The clinical s ignificance of an abnormal test value, within the context of the disease under study, 
must be determined by the investigator.  
Criteria for reporting laboratory values as an AE are provided in Section  10.1.1 . 
9.2.4.  Drug Concentration and Measurements  
Serum samples for REGN10933 and REGN10987 drug concentration measurement will be 
collected per the schedule of events for adult and adolescent subjects ( Table  4) and pediatric 
subjects (<12 years of age) ( Table  6).  For pediatric subjects (<18 years) only, a numbing cream 
may be used for blood sample collection.

 CONFIDENTIAL  A subset of the first 30 adult subjects (by subject number by IVRS) will have frequent sample 
collection (dense PK ).  The second subset will include the next 370 adult subjects (the 31st to 400th 
subjects ) who will have less frequent  sample collection (sparse  PK).  Pediatric subjects will have 
3 serum samples collected.  In order to collect serum samples over the study d uration, pediatric 
subjects will be assigned by IVRS to 1 of 4 sampling schedules (A, B, C, D) ( Table  6).  Any unused 
samples may be kept for up 15 years (or for a shorter time period if required per regional laws and 
regulations) after study completion for use in exploratory research.  
9.2.5.  Immunogenicity Measurements and Samples  
Immunogenicity will be assessed by ADA and NAb. Samples for ADA and NAb assessment will 
be collected for adult and adolescent subjects (<12 years) at time points listed in Table  4. Samples 
will be asses sed for ADA and NAb using samples collected for subjects (<12 years) at the time 
points listed in Table  6, if feasible. For pediatric subjects (<18 years)  only, a numbing cream may 
be used for blood sample collection.  Any unused samples may be kept for up 15 years (or for a 
shorter time period if required per regional laws and regulations) after study completion for use in 
exploratory research.  
9.2.6.  Exploratory  Pharmacodynamic/Biomarker Procedures  
A description of planned or potential exploratory analyses is provided below. Samples for 
assessment of pharmacodynamic and exploratory biomarkers will be collected from adult and 
adolescent subjects at time points ind icated in Table  4.  Sample for serological assays will be 
collected from pediatric subjects (<12 years) at the time points indicated in Table  6.  For pediatric 
subjects (<18 years) only, a numbing cream may be used for blood sample collection.  Residual 
serum or plasma samples collected fo r other purposes may also be used to study how 
REGN10933+REGN10987 work and SARS -CoV -2 infection, including but not limited to, 
cytokines, complement pathways, and other factors emerging to be associated with disease or 
clinical prognosis. Any unused sampl es may be kept for up 15 years (or for a shorter time period 
if required per regional laws and regulations) after study completion for use in exploratory 
research.  
9.2.6.1.  Virology  
9.2.6.1.1.  Viral Sequencing  
In support of public health initiatives to track SARS -CoV -2 genet ic variants, viral genome 
sequencing will be performed on all viral nucleic acid isolated from NP swab samples at baseline. 
Sequencing analyses will be of the entire viral genome, including the full gene sequence that 
encodes the SARS -CoV -2 S protein.  
The results of the viral sequencing will not be included in the clinical study report.  
9.2.6.1.2.  Viral Resistance  
Subjects will be assessed for virologic resistance, defined as (1) those subjects who are positive at 
baseline and remain positive without a consistent decr ease in viral load by 4 weeks, (2) those 
subjects who were negative and become positive during the EAP, and/or (3) those subjects who 
have 2 consecutive negative RT ‑qPCR tests with a subsequent positive RT -qPCR test result. For

 CONFIDENTIAL  subjects who exhibit viral r esistance, viral sequencing will be performed to understand the 
potential relationship between genetic mutations and mAb functional activity. Viral sequencing 
may also be done on a gender -matched placebo control group in order to determine whether any 
gene tic mutations observed in the mAb treatment group are naturally emergent genetic variants.  
The results of the viral resistance will not be included in the clinical study report.  
9.2.6.1.3.  Viral Infectivity  
To explore the effects of REGN10933+REGN10987 on infectivit y of SARS -CoV -2, we may use 
viral culture assays or sub genomic viral mRNA transcript analyses. Subgenomic viral RNA 
transcripts potentially indicate the presence of actively replicating virus in samples, as viral 
subgenomic mRNA is transcribed only in inf ected cells and is not packaged into virions. These 
data may be associated to RT -qPCR data from matched samples for each group and compare to 
placebo or other clinical or other measures in the study.  
9.2.6.2.  Serological Assays for Endogenous Anti -SARS -CoV -2 Antibo dies 
In order to assess the impact of baseline humoral immunity/antibody response to SARS -CoV -2 on 
REGN10933+REGN10987 efficacy to prevent SARS -CoV -2 infection, serum anti -SARS -CoV -2 
will be measured at baseline, including but not limited to those which de tect antibodies against the 
S protein and/or the N protein and/or neutralization assays. The impact of a positive serology result 
on drug efficacy will be assessed by associating seropositivity to positive SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR 
test from NP swabs. Association  of seropositivity with clinical endpoints and other measures may 
also be explored.  
To explore whether REGN10933+REGN10987 affect the generation of a humoral immune 
response to SARS -CoV -2, serum anti -SARS -CoV -2 N protein antibodies will be measured using 
immunoassays in REGN10933+REGN10987 groups as compared to placebo control, as well as to 
baseline.  
Any unused samples may be kept for up 15 years after study completion for use in exploratory 
research (or for a shorter time period if required per regional l aws and regulations).  
9.2.6.3.  Serum and Plasma for Research  
Research serum and plasma are being collected and banked for exploratory research related to 
COVID -19, SARS -CoV -2, REGN10933+REGN10987, host and viral biological pathways and 
mechanisms related disease activity and clinical outcomes. The data from these exploratory 
analyses may not be included in the CSR.  
9.2.7.  Pharmacogenomic Analysis (Optional)  
Adult and pediatric subjects (<18 years and ≥10 kg) who agree to participate in the genomics sub -
study will be requ ired to consent to this optional sub -study before collection of the samples. Blood 
sample for RNA must be collected predose on day 1. Whole blood samples for DNA extraction 
should be collected on day 1/baseline (predose) but can be collected at a later stu dy visit. For 
pediatric subjects (<18 years and ≥10 kg) only, a numbing cream may be used for blood sample 
collection. DNA and RNA samples will be collected for pharmacogenomics analyses to understand 
the genetic and/or transcriptional determinants of effi cacy and safety associated with the

 CONFIDENTIAL  treatments in this study and the molecular basis of SARS -CoV -2 infection. These samples will be 
single -coded as defined by the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline E15.  
Samples will be stored for up t o 15 years after the final date of the database lock (or for a shorter 
time period if required per regional laws and regulations). If there are specific site or country 
requirements involving the pharmacogenomic analyses which the Sponsor is unable to comp ly 
with, samples will not be collected at those sites.  
The purpose of the pharmacogenomic analyses is to identify genomic associations with clinical or 
biomarker response to REGN10933+REGN10987, other SARS -CoV -2 infection clinical outcome 
measures, and pos sible treatment -emergent adverse events.  In addition, associations between 
genomic variants and prognosis or progression of SARS -CoV -2 infection as well as related viral 
pneumonia and respiratory diseases may also be studied.  These data may be used or comb ined 
with data collected from other studies to identify and validate genomic and transcriptional markers 
related to the study drug, target pathway, or SARS -CoV -2 infection.  These data may also be 
combined with viral sequence analyses to study host/virus ge netic interactions.  
Analyses may include sequence determination or single nucleotide polymorphism studies of 
candidate genes and surrounding genomic regions. Other methods, including whole -exome 
sequencing, whole -genome sequencing, DNA copy number variatio n, and transcriptome 
sequencing (or other methods for quantitating RNA expression) may also be performed. The list 
of methods may be expanded to include novel methodology that may be developed during the 
course of this study or sample storage period.  
Resul ts from the genomic and transcriptional analyses will not be reported in the CSR.

 CONFIDENTIAL  10. SAFETY EVALUATION AN D REPORTING  
10.1. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
10.1.1.  General Guidelines  
The investigator must promptly record all clinical events occurring during the study data 
collection , from the time of signing the ICF to the end of study  (see Section  11.4.5.1 ). Medical 
conditions that existed or were diagnosed prior to the signing of the Informed Consent will be 
recorded as part of medical history. Abnormal laboratory values and vital signs observed at the 
time of Informed Consent shoul d also be recorded as medical history.  Any subsequent worsening 
(ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition that 
is temporally associated with the use of the study drug should also be recorded as an AE . 
At each visit, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by evaluating the 
subject.  Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by the subject or 
adolescent subject’s parent or guardian, or by questioning the subj ect or the adolescent subject’s 
parent or guardian at each study visit. Subjects or the subject’s parent or guardian should be 
questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms. The 
Investigator must assess all AEs t o determine seriousness, severity, and causality, in accordance 
with the definitions in Section  10.2. The investigator should recommend that subjects ( themselves 
or by their parent/guardian) measure their temperature daily during efficacy assessment period, 
approximately at the same time, and also every time the subject feels feverish, chills, or sick. The 
Investigator’s assessment must be clearly docume nted in the site’s source documentation with the 
Investigator’s signature. The Investigator should follow -up on SAEs (and AESIs) until they have 
resolved or are considered clinically stable; AEs should be followed until they are resolved or last 
study visi t, whichever comes first.  
Always report the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term. When a diagnosis is unavailable, report the 
primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details included in the narrative 
until the diagnosis becomes available. If the signs and symptoms are distinct and do not suggest a 
common diagnosis, report them as individual entries of AE or SAE.  
Laboratory results, vital signs, and other diagnostic result s or findings  should be appraised by the 
Investigator to determine the ir clinical significance.  Isolated abnormal laboratory results, vital sign 
findings, or other diagnostic findings (ie, not part of a reported diagnosis) should be reported as 
AEs if they are symptomatic, lead to study drug discontinuation,  dose reduction,  require corrective 
treatment, or constitute an AE in the investigator ’s clinical judgment . 
For events that are serious due to hospitalization, the reason for hospitalization must be reported 
as the serious adverse event (diagnosis or symptom requiring hosp italization). A procedure is not 
an AE or SAE, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE. Pre -planned (prior to 
signing the Informed Consent Form) procedure s, treatment s requiring hospitalization for pre -
existing conditions that do not worsen in  severity, and admission for palliative or social care should 
not be reported as SAEs (see Section  10.2 for Definitions).

 CONFIDENTIAL  For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of death should always be reported as an SAE.  
Any SAE that may occur subsequent to the reporting period (end of the on -treatment period) that 
the Investigator assesses as related to study drug should also be reported.  
All AEs, serious ad verse events (SAEs) , AESIs, and pregnancy reports are to be reported according 
to the procedures in Section  10.1.3 . 
10.1.2.  Reporting Procedure  
All events (serious and non -serious) must be reported with investigator’s assessment of the event’s 
seriousness, severity, and causality to the (when applicable: blinded) study drug. For SAEs and 
AESIs, a detailed narrative summarizing the course of the event, includ ing its evaluation, 
treatment, and outcome should be provided on the AE CRF. Specific or estimated dates of event 
onset, treatment, and resolution should be included, when available.  Medical history, concomitant 
medications, and laboratory data that are r elevant to the event should also be summarized in the 
narrative.  For fatal events, the narrative should state whether an autopsy was or will be performed 
and include the results if available. Information not available at the time of the initial report mus t 
be documented in a follow -up report. Source documents  (including hospital or medical re cords, 
diagnostic reports, etc ) will be summarized in the narrative on the AE CRF and retained at the  
study center and available upon request.  
Urgent safety queries mu st be followed up and addressed promptly. Follow -up information and 
response to non -urgent safety queries should be combined for reporting to provide the most 
complete data possible within each follow -up.  
10.1.3.  Events that Require Expedited Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event:  
• SAEs . 
• Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI; serious and nonserious) :  Adverse events 
of special interest for this study include the foll owing:  (as defined in Section  10.2.3 ): 
− Grade 3 or greater injection site reactions or hypersensitivity reactions including 
but not limited to anaphylax is, laryngeal/pharyngeal edema, severe bronchospasm, 
chest pain, seizure, or severe hypotension (AE grading system is provided in 
Section  10.2.4 ) 
• Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of 
the investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female  study subject  existing at the time of signing the 
informed consent form, during the study, and for  8 months following administration of 
the single dose of study drug. Any complication of pregnancy affecting a female study 
subject and/or fetus and/or newbor n that meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an 
SAE. Outcome for all pregnancies should be reported to the sponsor.

 CONFIDENTIAL  10.2. Definitions  
10.2.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a c ausal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to t he study drug (ICH 
E2A Guideline. Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Oct 1994).  
10.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a subject is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the subject is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event. This does not incl ude an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -subject hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization .  
In-subject hospitalization is defined as a hospital admission (any duration) or an 
emergency ro om visit for longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization 
is defined as a hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event, 
or is prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by the investigator 
or treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events.  
10.2.3.  Adverse Events of Sp ecial Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical 
interest specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid

10.2.5.  Causality  
The investigator must provide causality assessment as whether or not there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event, based on evidence or facts, his/her clinical 
judgment, and the following definitions. The causality assessment must  be made based on the 
available information and can be updated as new information becomes available.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 128 
 CONFIDENTIAL  For double blinded studies using an active comparator, the investigator should consider all study 
drugs in determining event causality.   
The following factors should be considered when assessing causality:  
• Temporal relationship: time to onset vs time drug was administered  
• Nature of the reactions: immediate vs long term  
• Clinical and pathological features of the events  
• Existing information about the drug & same class of drugs  
• Concomitant medications  
• Underlying and concurrent illnesses  
• Subject’s medical and social history  
Causality to the study drug (including study drug administration):  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reas onable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, subject’s clinical 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, concomitant medications), or other 
external factors.  
or 
− The AE foll ows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and is a known reaction to the drug under study or its class of drugs, or is predicted 
by known pharmacology.  
• Not Related:  
− The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from study drug admin istration, or 
can be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, subject’s clinical state 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications) or 
other external factors.  
Causality to the study conduct (protocol specified proc edure):  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from a protocol specified 
procedure, and cannot be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, 
subject’s clinical (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, concomitant 
medications) , or other external factors.  
• Not Related:  
− The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from a protocol specified procedure, 
or can be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, subject’s clinical state 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases , and concomitant medications) or 
other external factors.

 CONFIDENTIAL  10.3. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study subject at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion.  The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites. The Medical/Study Director will have primary responsibility 
for the emerging safety profile of the compou nd, but will be supported by other departments (eg, 
Pharmacovigilance; Global Patient Safety; Biostatistics and Data Management). Safety monitoring 
will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a periodic 
cumulative aggregate  basis.  
10.4. Notifying Health Authorities, Institutional Review Board/Ethics 
Committee and Investigators  
During the study, the sponsor and/or the CRO will inform health authorities, IRBs/ECs, and the 
participating investigators of any SUSARs (Suspected Unexpect ed Serious Adverse Reactions) 
occurring in other study centers or other studies of the active study drug 
(REGN10933+REGN10987), as appropriate per local reporting requirements. In addition, the 
sponsor and/or CRO will comply with any additional local safet y reporting requirements. All 
notifications to investigators will contain only blinded information.   
Upon receipt of the sponsor’s notification of a SUSAR that occurred with the study drug, the 
investigator will inform the IRB/EC unless delegated to the sp onsor.  
Event expectedness for study drug ( REGN10933+REGN10987 ) is assessed against the Reference 
Safety Information section of the IB that is effective for expedited safety reporting.   
At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety obs ervations made during the 
conduct of the trial in the Clinical Study Report to health authorities and IRBs/ECs as appropriate.

 CONFIDENTIAL  11. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the SAP for the study. The SAP will be revised prior to the end 
of the study  to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes to 
adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned analyses. The 
final SAP will be issued before the first database lock.  
Endpoints are listed in Section  4. Analysis variables are listed in Section  5.  
11.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
The following null and alternate hypotheses will be tested for the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints:  
H0: There is no  treatment difference between REGN10933+RE GN10987 and placebo  
H1: There is a treatment difference  between REGN10933+REGN10987 and placebo  
11.2. Justification of Sample Size  
An administrative assessment for assumption verification and sample size estimation for cohort A 
was conducted using unblinded descriptive analyses without performing any formal statistical 
hypothesis testing.  Analyses were  conducted in the group of cohort A subjects randomized from 
study initiation through the date of randomization that was associated with approximately 
30 RT-PCR events amongst cohort A seronegative subjects during the EAP (subjects overall 
regardless of baseline serology status  [eg, seronegative, seropositive, or other ]).  The subjects who 
were evaluated in this descriptive analysis wi ll not be included for the final efficacy analyses, 
however, these subjects will be included in the safety analyses  (Section  11.4.9 ). To maintain 
operational efficiencies and because of the progressive rollout of SARS -CoV -2 vaccination which 
may change the dynamics of virus transmission/infection in the near future, enrollment into the 
study was not paused while the administrative assessment was performed and was estimated that 
the total enrollment may reach approximately 3500 subjects.  The justification of sample size  in 
cohort A (Section  11.2.1 ) with the assumption of reduction  of symptomatic infection  is based on 
the results from the administrative assessment .  
11.2.1.  Cohort A: Adult and Adolescent Subjects (≥12 years) Who Are SARS -CoV -2 
RT-qPCR Negative at Baseline  
In cohort A, subjects are randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to REGN10933+REGN10987 or 
placebo. The primary hypothesis is the reduction in the proportion of symptomatic RT -qPCR 
(broad -term) confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infections  in seronegative subjects . To cal culate the sample 
size required to achieve at least 90% power  for seronegative subjects in cohort A, it is assumed 
that the statistical hypothesis will be tested in a 2 -sided test.  Based on the administrative 
assessment results among 409 seronegative subje cts in cohort A, a 50% reduction of infection s 
(symptomatic or asymptomatic) compared to the placebo group and a 100% reduction of 
symptomatic infection s compared to placebo group was observed. Due to the small sample size in 
the administrative assessment,  it is assume d, for the purpose of calculating study power,  that an 
approximately 50% reduction or greater in symptomatic infection s compared to placebo group will 
be expected for the final primary efficacy analysis.

 CONFIDENTIAL  In this household study design, the number of subjects per household, the correlation between 
subjects and symptomatic infection rates within a household are unknown.  To detect a relative 
risk of 0.5 (ie, 50% reduction of the assumed 10% attack rate in the placebo arm), equivalent to an 
odds ratio of 0.47, power was calculated compared to the p -value of 0.05 based on 2000 
simulations in 1248 subjects from 430  households (ie, assuming an average household size of 
2.9 seronegative subjects) .  Table  9 provides power calculations by varying degrees of correlation 
within household.  In all cases, the power of the study is >90% using a generalized linear model 
with the generalized estimation equat ion (GEE) approach and assuming a compound symmetry 
covariance matrix.

At least 1980 subjects will need to be enrolled in cohort A to have a minimum of  1248  seronegative 
subjects, assuming that 10% of subjects drop out  and 30% of subjects are seropositive at baseline.  
11.2.1.1.  Cohort A1: Pediatric Subjects (<12 years) Who Are SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR 
Negative at Baseline  
Approximately up to a total of 250 pediatric subjects (<12 years) will be enrolled in this study. Of 
the 250 subjects, 90% (225/250) are expected to be enrolled in this cohort (ie, central lab RT -qPCR 
negative at baseline) for evalu ation of the drug concentration and exposure, and safety.  The actual 
number of subjects in this cohort will depend on the actual percentage of subjects with a baseline 
negative RT -qPCR enrolled. No statistical hypothesis tests will be performed.  
11.2.2.  Cohort B:  Adult and Adolescent Subjects (≥12 years) Who Are SARS -CoV -2 
RT-qPCR Positive at Baseline   
The primary  endpoint in  asymptomatic, seronegative subjects in  cohort B is the proportion of 
subjects who subsequently develop signs and symptoms ( broad -term) within 14 days of a positive 
RT-qPCR test result at baseline or during the EAP .

 CONFIDENTIAL  The sample size of cohort B is based on the frequency of finding positive subjects while enrolling 
cohort A and assumes that approximately 10% of subjects in a household are already positive for 
SARS -CoV -2 by RT -qPCR at baseline. Among a pproximately  3500 adult and adolescent subjects 
that are anticipated to be enrolled in cohort A or cohort B , the number of subjects  expected in 
cohort  B is approximately 220 , including 200 seronegative subjects . Assuming that 50% of 
infected placebo subjects at baseline will develop symptoms, 200 seronegative subjects in cohort 
B will provide >9 0% power to detect a relative risk of 0.5 using a 2 -sided Fisher’s exact test at an 
alpha level of 0.05 .  
11.2.2.1.  Cohort B1: Pediatric Subjects (<12 years) Who Are SARS -CoV -2 RT -qPCR 
Positive at Baseline  
Approximately up to a total of 250 pediatric subjects (<12 ye ars) will be enrolled in this study. Of 
the 250 subjects, 10% (25/250) are expected to be enrolled in this cohort (ie, central lab RT -qPCR 
positive at baseline) for evaluating the drug concentration and exposure, and safety. No statistical 
hypothesis tests  will be performed. The actual number of subjects in this cohort will depend on the 
actual percentage of subjects with a baseline positive RT -qPCR enrolled. No statistical hypothesis 
tests will be performed.

Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treatment group, 
and by all subjects combined.  
11.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
11.4.3.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Cohort A  
The cohort A primary efficacy endpoint described in Section  4.1.1  will be analyzed in the 
seronegative m FAS-A population  (Section  11.3.1 ). All post -baseline efficacy assessments 
obtained up to last scheduled visit ( day 29) in EAP will be included for the primary analysis.  
In order to account for the correlation among subjects within a household and control the 
associated type 1 error inflation , a generalized linear model will be used to estimate the odds ratio 
between the treatment groups by using  the GEE approach. This model estimates a single 
within -household correlation coefficient. The model will include the  fixed category effects of 
treatment group (placebo versus REGN10933+REGN10987 ), region (US v ersus ex-US), and age 
(≥12 to <50, ≥50 years). The model will use a compound symmetry covariance matrix and estimate 
the odds ratio between the treatment groups an d corresponding 95% CI and p -value.   
If the GEE model fails to converge due to most households containing only a single study subject 
in seronegative mFAS -A or the percentage of households in cohort A with only a single study 
subject is 70% or more,  then a logistic regression model will be used, with treatment, region , and 
age group as fixed effects.  The threshold of 70% was based on simulations of within -household

proportion of single -subject households is high . Additional details will be provided in the SAP. If 
the logistic regression model does not converge, an exact logistic regression will be used. The 
estimates of odds ratio, the corresponding 95% CI and p -value will be provided from logistic 
regression (or exact logistic regression) for comparison of REGN10933+REGN10987 against 
placebo group.  
In cohort A, a subject will be considered having a  symptomatic  RT-qPCR confirmed SARS -CoV -2 
infection (broad -term)  during the EAP  if any of the post-baseline RT -qPCR results during EAP  
are positive  with at least 1 symptom within 14 days of a positive RT -qPCR  result .   
Cohort B  
The cohort B  primary efficacy endpoint  described in Section  4.2.1  will be analyzed in the 
seronegative m FAS-B population (Section  11.3.1 ). The same statistical methods as described for 
cohort A will be used to obtain the estimate of odds ratio and p -value for comparison between the 
treatment groups.  
In cohort B, a subject will be considered having a symptomatic RT -qPCR confirmed SARS -CoV -2 
infection (broad -term) during the EAP if subjects have at least 1 symptom within 14 days of a 
positive RT -qPCR result at baseline or during the EAP.  
Handling of Missing Central Lab SAR -CoV -2 RT-qPCR Data for Both Cohort A and 
Cohort  B  
Subjects with COVID -19 symptoms that are missing a  central lab-determined RT-qPCR test 
during the EAP (eg , are too sick to go to the study site) but have a positive SARS -COV -2 test from 
a local lab  (eg, in the hospital)  will be considered as having a symptomatic infection if any of the 
symptoms occurred within 14 days of the positive SARS -COV -2 test(s).  
The graphical display using Kaplan -Meier curve for the time to first symptom will also be 
provided.   
11.4.3.1.1.  Sensitivity Analyses  
Robustness of the primary analyses results in cohort A and cohort B will be assessed through 
sensitivity analyses as follows:  
Sensitivity analysis by excluding subjects who develop asymptomatic or symptomatic SARS -
CoV -2 infection within 72 hours of the study drug administration  
This analysis assesses for the sensitivity of the results to subjects who may have had undetected 
infections prior to dosing. That is, a subject had any onset of a positive RT -qPCR within 72 hours 
of the study drug administration will be excluded for this sensitivity analysis.  
This sensitivity analysis will only be performed for cohort A primary endpoint.  
Sensitivity analysis by excluding subjects from non -good clinical practice (GCP) Compliant 
Site(s) 
To access the impact of sites that had non -GCP compliance issues on the primary efficacy points, 
the primary analyses will be performed by excluding non -GCP compliant site(s).

11.4.3.1.2.  Subgroup Analyses  
To assess the homogeneity of the treatment effect across various subgroups, the primary analysis 
model with GEE approach will be applied to each subgroup if applicable; otherwise, the logistic 
regression model will be used. Odds ratio between the treatment groups and corresponding 95 % CI 
will be provided, as well as the within -household correlation coefficient from GEE approach, 
within each subgroup.  
The subgroups of interest to be evaluated for cohort A primary end point include , but are not 
limited to : 
• Stratification age group (years) (≥12 to <18, ≥18 to <50, ≥50) and the additional age 
group: ≥12 to <18, ≥18 years  
• Sex  
• Race

11.4.3.2.  Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
For cohort A, the key binary endpoint of the proportion of subjects who have a RT -qPCR 
confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection (regardless of symptoms) during the EAP, the same statistical 
method used in the primary analysis will be applied. If a subject’s overall infection status during 
the E AP cannot be determined due to missing RT -qPCR results, the following rules will be applied 
to impute the missing RT -qPCR data.  
1. For subjects satis fying the criteria specified in the  handling  of missing central lab 
SARS -CoV-2 RT-qPCR data  of the analysis of primary efficacy variables , the 
corresponding  visit(s) will be considered as having a positive RT -qPCR test .  
2. After the first step above, each planned visit with missing RT -qPCR data will be imputed 
100 times to generate 100 complete datasets b ased on the predicted probability using the 
fully conditional specification (FCS)  (Van Buuren, 2006 ) through the logistic regression. 
The logistic regression model includes the fixed effect factors of treatment group, regi on, 
age group, and RT -qPCR testing status at other analysis visits during the EAP. This 
imputation will repeat by iterating for each analysis visit with missing RT -qPCR testing 
status.  Full details on details on the use of FCS from the SAS MI procedure  will be 
provided in the SAP.

 CONFIDENTIAL  For the key binary endpoint of the proportion of subjects with viral load >4 (log10 copies/mL), if 
NP swab viral load data is missing for a visit, it will not be imputed regardless of symptoms. Only 
non-missing available NP swab viral load data will be used for the analysis of this endpoint. Only 
subjects with at least one post -baseline viral load (log10 copies/mL) data in NP swab samples will 
be included in the analysis.  
For cohort A the key binary endpoint regarding the index ca se linkage to 
R10933 -10987 -COV -2067, the Fisher's exact test will be used.  
For continuous key secondary endpoints in cohort A and cohort B (eg, number of weeks of high 
viral load >4 (log10 copies/mL) in NP swab samples and number of weeks of symptomatic 
RT-qPCR -confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection (broad -term) during the EAP, etc ), visits with 
missing viral load regardless of symptoms and visits with missing RT -qPCR that do not have any 
broad -term symptoms within 14 days will not be considered as meeting these endpoint criteria, 
respectively. These endpoints will be analyzed by the non -parametric method, a stratified 
Wilcoxon rank sum test (Van Elteren Test) with the region and age group. Descriptive statistics 
will be provided for number (%) of subjects with ea ch interval of duration in weeks (ie, 0 week, 
> 0 to ≤ 1 week, > 1 to ≤2 weeks, etc) within each treatment group. The total weeks of infection 
and normalized duration (eg, average duration infection per 100 0 subjects ) per treatment group 
will also be repor ted. 
11.4.3.3.  Other  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Other s econdary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed by type of endpoint for all cohort s. The 
analysis methods  for key secondary efficacy endpoints in both cohort A and cohort B will also be 
applied to efficacy endpoi nts for exploratory endpoints in both cohort A and cohort B  if 
appropriate . The primary approach to the data will be through descriptive statistics . For the 
comprehensive evaluation of efficacy, nominal p -values may be reported.  Raw data descriptive 
statis tics will also be presented.  
Other s econdary efficacy endpoints and exploratory endpoints for cohort A1 and cohort B1 will 
also be analyzed by type of endpoint. If the sample size is sufficient, continuous variables will be 
summarized by the descriptive statistics (eg, n, mean, SD, Q1, median, Q3, minimum and 
maximum, etc.). Binary variables will be summarized using the number and percentage of subjects 
in each treatment group. No statistical hypot hesis test ing will be performed for cohort A1 and 
cohort B1.  This approach may also be applied to adolescent subjects.  
Binary Endpoints  
The binary endpoints in cohort A and cohort B will be analyzed applying the same approach used 
for the primary efficacy  endpoints .  The details will be provided in the SAP.  
Continuous Endpoints   
The secondary and exploratory continuous efficacy endpoints such as TWA, AUC, and maximum 
viral load (log10 copies/mL) will be analyzed using the ANOVA including treatment group, 
region , and age group as fixed effects  or using the ANCOVA if adjusting by  the relevant baseline  
values as covariate and treatment -by-covariate interaction are needed .  For other endpoints with 
non-normal/skewed distribution, the  Van Elteren test used in the key secondary endpoints will be 
applied.

parent(s) or legal guardian(s) can understand.  The ICF should be signed and dated by the subject’s 
parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and the same investigator or designee who explained the ICF.  
Local law must be observed in deciding whether 1 or both p arents/guardians consent is required.  
If only 1 parent or guardian signs the consent form, the investigator must document the reason the 
other parent or guardian did not sign.  The subject may also be required to sign and date the ICF, 
as determined by th e IRB/EC and in accordance with the local regulations and requirements.  
• Subjects who can write but cannot read will have the assent form read to them before 
writing their name on the form.  
• Subjects who can understand but who can neither write nor read will  have the ICF 
read to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF to 
confirm that informed consent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the subject’s study record, and a 
copy of the signed  ICF must be given to the subject’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).  
13.3. Subjects Confidentiality and Data Protection  
The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anonymity of each study 
subject will be maintained. Subjects should be i dentified by a subject identification number only, 
on CRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor. Documents that will not be submitted to 
the sponsor (eg, signed ICF) must be kept in strict confidence.  Government agencies such as 
Health and Human Se rvices, other health authorities, IRBs/ ECs, and staff/contractors may review 
these records, as appropriate.

 CONFIDENTIAL  The subject 's and investigator's personal data, which may be included in the sponsor database, 
will be treated in compliance with all applicable l aws and regulations.  The sponsor shall take all 
appropriate measures to safeguard and prevent access to this data by any unauthorized third party.  
13.4. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee  
An appropriately constituted IRB/EC, as described in ICH guideli nes for GCP, must review and 
approve:  
• The protocol, ICF, and any other materials to be provided to the subjects 
(eg, advertising) before any subject may be enrolled in the study  
• Any amendment or modification to the study protocol or ICF before implementati on, 
unless the change is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the subject, in which 
case the IRB/EC should be informed as soon as possible  
• Ongoing studies on an annual basis or at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk  
In addition, the IRB/ EC should be informed of any event likely to affect the safety of subjects or 
the continued conduct of the clinical study.  
A copy of the IRB/EC approval letter with a current list of the IRB/EC members and their functions 
must be received by the sponsor pr ior to shipment of drug supplies to the investigator.  The 
approval letter should include the study number and title, the documents reviewed, and the date of 
the review.  
Records of the IRB/EC review and approval of all study documents (including approval o f ongoing 
studies) must be kept on file by the investigator.  
13.5. Clinical Study Data Transparency  
Final study results will be published on a public clinical trial website according to applicable local 
guidelines and regulations.  Treatment codes will be disseminated to each investigation site 
thereafter.  
14. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
The sponsor may not implement a change in the design of the protocol or ICF without an 
IRB/EC -approved amendment.  Where required per local legislation, regulatory authority approval 
will also be sought.

OUT OF A SITE  
15.1. Premature Termination of the Study  
The sponsor has the right to terminate the study prematurely.  Reasons may include efficacy, 
safety, or futility, among others.  Should the sp onsor decide to terminate the study, the 
investigator(s) will be notified in writing.  
15.2. Close -out of a Site  
The sponsor and the investigator have the right to close -out a site prematurely.  
Investigator’s Decision  
The investigator must notify the sponsor of a  desire to close -out a site in writing, providing at least 
30 days’ notice.  The final decision should be made through mutual agreement with the sponsor.  
Both parties will arrange the close -out procedures after review and consultation.  
Sponsor’s Decision  
The sponsor will notify the investigator(s) of a decision to close -out a study site in writing.  
Reasons may include the following, among others:  
• The investigator has received all items and information necessary to perform the study, 
but has not enrolled any subject within a reasonable period of time  
• The investigator has violated any fundamental obligation in the study agreement, 
including but not limited to, breach of this protocol (and any applicable amendments), 
breach of the applicable laws and regulat ions, or breach of any applicable ICH 
guidelines  
• The total number of subjects required for the study are enrolled earlier than expected  
In all cases, the appropriate IRB/EC and Health Authorities must be informed according to 
applicable regulatory require ments, and adequate consideration must be given to the protection of 
the subjects’ interests.  
16. CONFIDENTIALITY  
Confidentiality of information is provided as a separate agreement.  
17. FINANCING AND INSURA NCE

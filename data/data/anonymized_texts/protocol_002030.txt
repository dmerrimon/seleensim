2.0 Background  Chronic sinusitis/rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps is a multifactorial disease  
associated with asthma, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, acetylsalicylic acid  
intolerance, and possibly allergy. It is defined as an inflammation of 1 or more paranasal sinuses and is considered chronic when it lasts longer than 8 weeks (Slavin 2005). It is almost always accompanied by concurrent airway inflammation and in many cases is preceded by rhinitis symptoms.  Chronic sinusitis is one of the most commonly diagnosed diseases in the United States. It has been estimated to affect approximately 20 million Americans (Benson 1998) and up to an 
estimated 16% of the adult population annually in Europe (Huvenne 2009). There are currently no approved medications for treatment of chronic sinusitis.  The cardinal clinical signs and symptoms of chronic sinusitis include nasal blockage/congestion, facial pain or pressure, mucosal erythema and thickening, purulent nasal secretions, headache, and a reduction in smell (Fokkens 2007). Chronic disease is distinguished in part by persistence of characteristic symptoms for ≥8 weeks (Slavin 2005).  Patients with nasal polyps tend to have a more pronounced nasal obstruction and loss of smell while those without nasal polyps tend to report headache and post-nasal drip more frequently. However, the pattern of symptoms mostly overlaps between patients with and without nasal polyps.  Current Treatment Options: There is clear need for a better medical therapy that reduces chronic 
sinusitis symptoms, thus improving morbidity and quality of life and decreasing the need for surgery. Currently, there are no approved medications for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. A

 number of antibiotics have been approved for the treatment of acute sinusitis; however, there is 
no conclusive evidence that or al antibiotics, topical antibiotics, or topical antifungal agents are 
effective in the treatment of chronic sinusitis, and their use remains controversial, particularly due to concerns over emerging resistance (Ebbens 2006; Fokkens 2007; Videler 2008). As chronic sinusitis is characteristically an inflammatory disease, the anti- inflammatory effects of 
corticosteroids could be expected to be of benefit. There are no clinical studies published on the use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic sinusitis without polyps, although there is evidence that systemic corticosteroids are effective at reducing the size of nasal polyps and improving rhinitis symptoms (Fokkens 2007; Van Zele 2010). Medical treatment with nasal corticosteroids (as currentl y available for treatment of rhinitis) is considered a first step in the 
treatment of chronic sinusitis; however, the data on sprays or drops does not suggest they are very effective.  
 Patients with chronic sinusitis currently have limited medical options  for treatment and no 
medication is approved for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. Standard nasal spray pumps suffer from a number of drawbacks and they are considered suboptimal for reliable drug delivery to target sites beyond the nasal valve (Aggarwal 2004). Current congestion medications are not always fully effective.  This study aims to test the safety and efficacy of the SinuSonic device on adults with moderate to severe nasal congestion.  SinuSonic is a medical device that utilizes sound and pressure combined with normal breathing to relieve nasal congestion. The study will take place over the course of 4 to 6 weeks starting with a baseline assessment.  This study will use patient responses to measure how effective SinuSonic devices are in treating  adults with 
moderate to severe congestion in adults.  3.0 Intervention to be studied 
 
• Initial intervention: Subjects will use the SinuSonic device for 3 minutes in the clinic setting.  
• Secondary intervention: Subjects will use SinuSonic device twice daily for 3 minutes in the home setting for 14 days.  
• Tertiary intervention: Subjects will continue to use the SinuSonic device twice daily for 3 minutes in the home setting for 2- 4 weeks.  
3.1 Device Instructions  
 
Instructions for use: 

Version 1.0; Version Date: 01/12/19 
 
Page 3 of 23 
 1. Hold the SinuSonic device at a 45 -degree angle  
2. Deep breathe  
3. Hold the SinuSonic to your mouth and blow out into the mask of the SinuSonic. 
The goal here is to hear the “target flutter” sound that is desired during treatment with the SinuSonic 
4. Put the device over the nose using the nasal mask  
5. Breathe in and out thru the nose if possible. If nasal breathing is not possible it is ok to open mouth to breathe in and try and hear the “target flutter” sound when you breathe out  
6. You will feel a little resistance to breathe  out and a vibration sensation from a 
speaker in the device  
7. Remove the device to “blow the nose” if nasal drainage occurs  
8. Return the device to the nose then breathe in and out thru the nose to try and hear the “target flutter” sound  
9. Time of use is 2 -5 min utes of nasal breathing with the device - as tolerated  
3.2 Device Usage and Safety  
The SinuSonic consists of a fully-disposable medical grade silicone nosepiece mounted to a resin 
body. The device is equipped with a flutter valve located at the top of the device which creates gentle, self -guided oscillating expiratory resistance.  
 4.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria/ Study Population

5.0 Number of Subjects  
This is a pilot study.  The anticipated study population is 40 subjects.  
6.0 Setting  
Research will be conducted at the Medical University of South Carolina.  Potential 
participants screening as well as the 2 -week post treatment assessment will take place in 
the outpatient sinus clinics .  The 4- 6 week assessment will be done via email ing of 
surveys. 
7.0 Recruitment Methods  
MUSC  Otolaryngologists will notify the study coordinator (SC) of potential participants 
through the Sinus Clinic .  If the patient is interested, the SC will approach them and 
explain the study in further detail and begin the informed consent process.   8.0 Consent Process  
Patients who are deemed eligible for this study will be approached by the Principal 
Investigator or Co -Investigator in the Sinus Clinic  at the Medical University of South 
Carolina about the study.  A member of the study team will describe in full detail  the 
study and the informed consent form to the potential subject.  The prospective participant will be given adequate time to review the informed consent form and ask any questions that they have before the consent is obtained.  Participants will be given a signed copy of the ICF.  
8.1  Withdrawal 
At any point during the study, a subject may withdraw from the study. 
9.0  Study Design / Methods  
This study is designed as a pilot study.  
Data will be collected by the ENT fellows as well as the subjects the mselves throughout 
the entirety of the study.  The data will consist of answers from subjects for 
questionnaires asked by the clinicians as well as self -reported answers from the subjects.  
Safety will be monitored throughout the study based on monitoring of ad verse events, 
performing nasal, measuring vital signs (i.e. blood pressure, pulse) and weight, and through collection of concomitant medication information.   
The period of observation for collection of non-serious adverse events extends from the 
time the subject gives informed consent until completion of the End-of-study visit or 
Early Termination Visit. Serious adverse events (SAE) will be reported from the time of informed consent through 30 days after the last use of the SinuSonic. Adverse event dat a 
listings will be reviewed by SinuSonic at regular intervals throughout the study.  In addition, SinuSonic will be alerted of Adverse Events of interest via automated emails programmed in the EDC system.

10.0 Data Management 
All analyses and graphs will be performed with SPSS 24.0, Sample Power 3.0, and Sigma 
Plot 10.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL.).  Disease information and demographic variables, such as age, gender, race, quality of life (QOL) scores, and VAS scores will be summarized using frequencies, means, and standard deviation as appropriate.  Outcome metri cs will be 
compared between baseline and 5 minutes (AIM 1), baseline and 2 weeks (AIM 2), and baseline and 4 -6 weeks (AIM 3).  Categorical variables will be compared using Chi 
Square or McNemar’s test.  Continuous variables will be compared using One- Way 
ANOVA with repeated measures follow by post-hoc analysis.  Data regarding safety and patient satisfaction will be summarized for each time point.  A p -value ≤0.05 will be 
considered statistically significant.  Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no p-value correction (ie Bonferroni) will be applied.  If appropriate, subgroup analysis can be performed based on underlying disease classification (allergic rhinitis, nonallergic rhinitis, CRSsNP, CRSwNP). 
11.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
Safety will be monitored throughout the study based on the monitoring of adverse events, 
performing nasal exams, measuring vital signs (i.e. blood pressure, pulse) and weight, 
and through the collection of concomitant medication information. 
The period of observation for collection of non-serious adverse events extends from the 
time the subject gives informed consent until the completion of the End-of-Study visit or Early Termination Visit.  Serious adverse events (SAE) will b e reported  to the MUSC 
IRB and to the sponsor from the time of informed consent through 30 days after the last use of the SinuSonic.  Adverse event data listings will be reviewed by Principal Investigator and the research team at regular intervals throughout the study.

 19.0  DATA SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
Safety data listings will be reviewed by Principal Investigator, Co-Investigators, and the research 
team at regular intervals throughout the study.   
Safety will be monitored throughout the study based on monitoring of adverse events, 
performing nasal exams, measuring vital signs (ie blood pressure, pulse) and weight, and through 
collection of concom itant medication information.   
The period of observation for collection of non-serious adverse events extends from the time the 
subject gives informed consent until completion of the End-of-study visit or Early Termination 
Visit. Serious adverse events (SAE) will be reported to the MUSC IRB and to the sponsor from the time of informed consent through 30 days after the last use of the SinuSonic. Adverse event data listings will be reviewed by the principal investigator, co- investigators, and the research 
team at regular i ntervals throughout the study. 
All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to SinuSonic use, spanning from the signature of the informed consent form until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient, 
are to be reported to the Healthy Humming, LLC. All AEs which follow the MUSC IRB 
qualifications will also be repor ted to the MUSC IRB within 24 hours of site knowledge of the 
event.  
The Investigator will take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investigations may be 
requested by the monitoring team up to as notice d by Healthy Humming, LLC. 
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator will immediately (within 24 hours) report 
the event to Healthy Humming, LLC and to the MUSC IRB, as applicable.

TITLE:  
A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled  Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and 
Safety  of TRC101 in Subjects  with Chronic Kidney Disease and Metabolic Acidosis  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  
TRCA -301 
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:  
TRC101  
INDICATION : 
Treatment of metabolic acidosis  associated  with chronic kidney dise ase (CKD)  
OBJECTIVES : 
Efficacy:  To evaluate the efficacy of TRC101 in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis  (blood bicarbonate 
12 to 20 mEq/L)  
Safety:     To evaluate the safety of administration of TRC101 in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis  
(blood bicarbonate 12 to 20 mEq/L)  
POPULATION : 
This study will enroll approximately 210 m ale and female subjects, 18 to 85 years of age with CKD  (an 
estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR ] of 20 to 40 mL/min/1.73 m2) and low blood bicarbonate  (12 to 
20 mEq/L ).  At least half of the subjects enrolled will have a blood bicarbonate level of  12 to 18 mEq/L.  
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION : 
This is a double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel- design, 2-arm study .  Approximately 210 subjects will be 
randomized in a 4:3 ratio into one of the two arms (6 g TRC101 or placebo administered once daily [QD] 
with lunch).  
Study periods are the following:  
• Screening Period  (up to 2 weeks).  
• Treatment Period  (12 weeks)  starting with Baseline Visit (Day 1) .  At the end of 12- week Treatment 
Period eligible subjects may enroll into a 40 -week extension study.  
• Follow -up Period (2 weeks after discontinuation of treatment, whether subject completes treatment or 
discontinues early)  for subjects who do not enroll in the extension study . 
After providing informed consent, the eligibility of potential subjects will be evaluated based on laboratory 
values,  medical history, concomitant medications, vital signs, pregnancy test (if applicable), and physical 
examination.  Three qualifying fasting blood bicarbonate values  (obtained at Screening 1, Screening 2, and 
Baseline Visits based on onsite measurement using an i -STAT point -of-care device) are required to establish 
subject’s eligibility .  Both Screening  blood bicarbonate v alues and the average of two Screening and Day 1  
values (i.e., baseline bicarbonate) must be within the range 12 to 20 mEq/L.  Two qualifying eGFR values of 
20 to 40 mL/min/1.73m2 at the Screening 1 and Screening 2 Visits are required to establish subject’s 
eligibility .  The Screening 1 and Screening 2 Visits must be at least 5 days apart .   
Qualified subjects  will be randomiz ed on the morning of the Baseline Visit ( Day 1), which is the fi rst day of  
the 12-week Treatment Period .  A collection of baseline  venous blood and urine samples will be performed 
in a fasting  state pre-dose.  Following randomization, designated unblinded site staff will assist the subject in 
administering the first dose of study drug, which will be taken onsite in the morning with food (light meal or 
snack) after collection of baseline laboratory specimens.  Subjects will be given a dosing diary in which to  
record the time of study drug dosing.  
Subjects will continue dosing on an out -patient basis for the subsequent 12 weeks (Treatment Period) .  
Dosing of oral c oncomitant medications and study drug will be separated by at l east 4 hours.  The study drug 
dose will be fixed during the first 4 weeks of the Treatment Period , except for s ubjects with blood

Confidential   Page 6 of 80 bicarbonate  ≥ 27 mEq/L.  Subjects with a blood bicarbonate level of 27 to 30 mEq/L will have their dose of 
study drug decreased per the titration algorithm ( see Appendix  2).  Subjects with a confirmed blood 
bicarbonate level > 30 mEq/L , will undergo an interruption  of the study drug dose in accordance with the 
titration algorithm  (see Appendix  2).  Beginning at the Week 4 Visit, subjects with a blood bicarbonate level 
below the normal range ( < 22 mEq/L) will have a blinded adjustment of the study drug dose in accordance 
with the titration algorithm  (see Appendix  2).  At any time during the study, s ubjects  with a confirmed blood 
bicarbonate level  < 12 mEq/L will be evaluated by the Investigator for new acute acidotic processes and 
discussed with the Medical Monitor.  The Medical Monitor will determine whether the subject m ay continue 
in the study .  During the 12-week Treatment Period, s ubjects will attend  eight study visits ( Day 1, Weeks 1, 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) for efficacy and safety assessments.   
Subjects who complete the Treatment Period will be offered participation  in a 40 -week extension study 
(TRCA -301E) .  Subjects who are not willing to participate in the extension study or who are not eligible will 
enter the 2-week Follow -up Period and return to the study site for two visits: Follow -up 1 (Week 13) and 
Follow -up 2 (Week 14), for adverse event (AE) collection, fasting blood draws and safety assessments as 
outlined in the Schedule of Events  (see Appendix 1).  Subj ects who withdraw from the study prematurely 
(i.e., prior to the Week 12 Visit) will undergo  an Early Termination (ET) Visit , during which all Week 12 
Visit assessments will be performed, followed by Follow -up 1 and 2  Visits  in 1 and 2 weeks, respectively .  
Blood draws for bicarbonate measurements will be done  when subjects  are in a fasted state (at least 4 hours)  
and at approximately the same time of day for each subject.  
The maximum study duration is anticipated to be 16 weeks  per subject, including the Screening Period (up to 
2 weeks ), 12- week  Treatment Period , and 2-week  Follow -up Period .  The maximum TRCA -301 study 
duration for subjects who continue into the extension Study TRCA -301E will be 14 weeks (excluding the 2-
week Follow -up Period).  
INCLUSION CRITE RIA: 
1. Have provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study.  
2. Male or female subjects 18 to  85 years of age  at Screening 1 Visit . 
3. Have a blood bicarbonate value of 12 to 20 mEq/L at Screening 1  and Screening 2  Visits AND

bicarbonate) within the range 12 to 20 mEq/L based on onsite measurement  using an i-STAT 
point of care device. 
Screening 1 and Screening 2 Visits must be at least 5 days apart.  
Note:  Subjects with baseline blood bicarbonate values of 12 to 18 mEq/L  are eligible  without 
restriction.   Once 105 subjects with baseline blo od bicarbonate value s of > 18 to 20 mEq/L have

eGFR can be calculated using CKD -EPI equation based on onsite  serum creatinine 
measurement at the Baseline Visit to establish subject’s eligibility .  
Screening 1 and Screening 2 Visits must be at least 5 days apart.  
5. Have stable renal function as defined by eGFR values at both Screening Visits that are not 
different by more than 20% ( the higher of the two Screening eGFR values will be used as the

Confidential   Page 9 of 80 ENDPOINTS:  
Primary Efficacy:   
Having a c hange from baseline (CFB) in blood bicarbonate ≥ 4 mEq/L or having blood bicarbonate in 
the normal range (22 to 29 mEq/L) at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  
Secondary Efficacy:  
CFB in blood bicarbonate at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  
Exploratory Efficacy:  
1. CFB in the total score of the Kidney Disease and Quality of Life ( KDQOL ) Question 3 items (daily 
activities) at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  
2. CFB in repeated chair stand test duration at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  
Safety:  
1. AEs, SAEs and withdrawal  of study treatment  due to AE.  
2. Having met the high bicarbonate dose interrup tion criterion (confirmed > 30 mEq/L) at any time 
during the Treatment P eriod . 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
This is a double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel- design, 2-arm, study.  Subjects will be randomized in a 
4:3 ratio into one of the two arms (6 g TRC101 or placebo administered QD with lunch).  Randomization  
will be stratified by baseline blood bicarbonate (≤ 18 mEq/L vs. > 18 mEq/L)  and screening eGFR  
(< 30 mL/min/1.73m2 vs. ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m2), which represents  an average of two eGFR values obtained at 
Screening 1 and Screening 2 Visits . 
Two populations will  be analyzed in this study:  
1. Modified intent -to-treat (MITT) analysis set:  All randomized subjects who had baseline and at least 
one post -baseline bicarbonate value s. 
2. Safety analysis set:  All subjects who received any amount of s tudy drug (TRC101 or place bo). 
Frequencies and percentages will be presented for the categorical variables and descriptive statistics will be 
presented for continuous variables.   
Efficacy :  Efficacy data will be summarized by treatment group for subjects in the MITT  analysis set b ased 
on the randomized treatment group assignment.  The bicarbonate results read from the i -STAT device will be 
the basis for efficacy evaluations.  
The primary efficacy analysis will compare TRC101 and placebo with respect to the proportions of subjects 
who are responders  at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit ).  Responders are  defined as having a CFB in 
blood bicarbonate ≥ 4 mEq/L or having blood bicarbonate in the normal range (22 to 29 mEq/L) at the end of 
treatment (Week 12 Visit).  The primary endpoint analys is will include : 
1. The difference in proportion (between TRC101 and placebo subjects ) and its exact (Clopper -
Pearson)  95% CI , as well as  the p -value from Fisher’s exact test comparing the TRC101 group and 
the placebo group will be reported by time point; and    
2. The proportion of subjects in each group who are responders,  along with their exact (Clopper -
Pearson) 95% CIs,  will be summarized by treatment group and time point.   
The secondary  efficacy analysis will compare the  least squares (LS) mean s CFB  in bicarbonate level  between 
the TRC101 group and placebo group at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  The secondary  endpoint will 
be assessed using a longitudinal mixed model for repeated measures  (MMRM).   
Explor atory efficacy analyses will be specified in the statistical analysis plan  (SAP) . 
Statistical significance will be declared with  a two-sided test at the 0.05 level .  In order to control family -
wise error rate, statistical testing for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed 
sequentially .  At the Week 12  Visit, Fisher’s exact test  will be used to compare the group proportions .   If 
this formal test is statistically significant, a second formal test for the proportion of TRC101 responders at 
Week 12 will be conduct ed.  Only when the primary efficacy result  is statistically significant will a formal

Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 201 7 
 
Confidential   Page 10 of 80 test for the secondary efficacy  endpoint  (CFB in blood bicarbonate at Week 12 Visit)  be performed.    
Safety :  Safety will be summarized by treatment group for subjects in  the safety analysis set.  Number and 
percentage of subjects with treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) classified by system organ class (SOC) and 
preferred term (PT); number (%) of subjects experiencing TEAEs by severity, causality, seriousness and 
action taken with regard to study drug will be summarized by treatment group.  Number (%) of subjects with 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment will also be summarized by treatment group. Clinical laboratory test results, vital signs and ECG findings will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group and time point. The primary analysis for change in eGFR will be based on serum creatinine 
(a supportive analysis will use serum cystatin C , due to the potential for changes in muscle mass related to 
bicarbonate correction ).  Categorical display methods (e.g., frequencies, shift tables) and plots of laboratory 
values over time may also be used, as appropriate.  Newly observed, clinically significant physical examination findings will be listed. 
  
Other Analyses :  Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group.  
Exposure to study drug, dosing compliance, and concomitant medications will be summarized by treatment group.  The number and percentage of subjects who use d prior and/or concomitant medications will be 
summarized by Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification levels and treatment group.   
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
Primary efficacy endpoint:  A sample size of 120 subjects in the TRC101 group and 90 s ubjects in the 
placebo group will have high power to detect differences between the TRC101 - and placebo -treated groups.   
The sample size calculation is based on the data from the Phase 1/2 Study TRCA -101, where 3% of placebo 
and 46% of TRC101 treated subj ects had an increase in blood bicarbonate of ≥ 4 mEq/L or had blood 
bicarbonate in the normal range at Week 2.  We assume the full TRC101 treatment effect had not been reached during this short treatment period.  In Study TRCA -301, we expect to observe that 50 to 55% of 
TRC101 -treated and 10% of placebo -treated subjects will have an increase of ≥ 4 mEq/L or have blood 
bicarbonate in the normal range at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  A Fisher's exact test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level will have over 99% power to detect this difference when 90 placebo subjects 
and 120 TRC101 subjects are enrolled.  If the true proportion of TRC101 subjects who respond at the Week 12 Visit is indeed between 50% and 55% and if no more than 5% of subjects have missing data at Week 12, 
the study will have roughly 90% power to result in a 95% confidence limit with a lower bound of at least 35% and 40%, respectively .   
The s ample size calculation for the secondary efficacy endpoint will be documented in the SAP.

1.1 Disease Background 
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) continue to generate acid from metabolism but 
have a reduced ability to excrete acid via the kidney.  As a result, metabolic acidosis, characterized by a reduced blood bicarbonate concentration (i.e., below 22 mEq/L), can 
develop in advanced stages of CKD.  Chronic metabolic acidosis affects 13 – 39% of CKD Stage 3 – 5 patients ( Eustace, 2004; Raphael, 2014; Moranne, 2009).  If chronic metabolic 
acidosis is left untreated, the consequences include increased mortality, acceleration of kidney disease, acceleration of muscle breakdown, and the development or exacerbation of bone disease ( Dobre, 2015).   
Clinical outcomes for CKD patients with bicarbonate levels that are below normal 
(i.e., < 22 mEq/L) are s ignificantly worse compared to pa tients  with normal bicarbonate 
(i.e., 22 – 29 mEq/L) ; this has been demonstrated in multiple large retrospective database 
analyses  reported in the literature  (Shah 2009; Dobre 2013; Raphael 2011; Tangri 2011; 
Kovesdy 2009; Navaneethan 2011; Raphael 2016).  The relationship be tween decreasing 
bicarbonate levels and clinical outcomes is believed to be a continuum (i.e., as bicarbonate decreases  from normal levels  the risk of adverse outcomes , such as death, progression of 
CKD and hospitalization, progressively increases ).  Hazar d ratios for patients with 
bicarbonate levels in the range required for subjects in this study (i.e., 12 to 20 mEq/L) are significantly worse than for patients with bicarbonate levels indicative of more mild metabolic acidosis (i.e., > 20 to 22 mEq/L).  Correction of low bicarbonate levels in patients with CKD (i.e., with oral alkali supplementation or consumption of a less acidic diet) has been shown to result in slowing of progression of renal disease ( de Brito -Ashurst 2009; 
Phisitkul 2010 ; Mahajan 2010; Goraya 2013; Goraya 2014; Garneata 2016 ), improvements in 
muscle mass/function ( de Brito -Ashurst 2009; Abramowitz 2013) and improvement in bone 
health ( Domrongkitchaiporn 2002).  
Currently , no approved therapies are available for controlling bicarbonate in patients who 
have chronic metabolic acidosis.  Use of unapproved oral alkali supplements (e.g., food 
additives such as oral sodium bicarbonate and off- label use of potassium citrate) is general 
clinical  practice, however these agents have been studied only in patients with mild 
metabolic acidosis.  Most prospective trials limited doses of oral sodium bicarbonate to < 2 g 
per day resulting in modest increases in blood bicarbonate of 2 – 3 mEq/L.  The daily doses of sodium bicarbonate required to increase blood bicarbonate levels by 3 – 4 mEq/L in 
patients with metabolic acidosis are prohibitively high (6 – 8 g per day introducing 
1.6 – 2.2 g of sodium ; Abramowitz 2013).  Combined with the sodium intake from diet, this 
would result in a total daily sodium load exceeding the gui deline- recommended limit of 
2.4 g/day for CKD patients (KDOQI, 2002 ) independent of underlying comorbidities.  
Furthermore, common conditions accompanying CKD (e.g., hypertension, heart failure, edema) may be aggravated by the sodium load that alkali therapies deliver and efficacy of diuretics reduced .  As such, there is a clear unmet medical need for new treatments with 
demonstrated efficacy and safety to treat chronic metabolic acidosis.

Confidential   Page 19 of 80 1.2 Description of Investigational Product 
TRC101 i s being developed as a fir st-in-class , orally a dministered, counterion- free, 
insoluble, non-absorbed hydrochloric acid  binder for the treatment of metabolic acidosis in 
patients with CKD .  It is a free -flowing powder composed of low- swelling, spherical beads 
approximate ly 
100 micrometers in diameter.  The TRC101 bead size is carefully controlled 
in order to r
estrict absorption of particles from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, consistent with 
several literature reports that show particles larger than 0.5 micrometers are not systemically 
absorbed ( Jung, 2000 ).  Nonclinic
al studies with radiolabeled TRC101 conducted in rats and 
dogs confirmed the lack of systemic absorption of TRC101. 
TRC101 is insoluble in aqueous and nonaqueous solvents.  TRC101 has both high H+ and Cl- 
binding ca pacity and Cl- binding selectivity.  The high amine content of the polymer is 
responsible for the high H+ and Cl- binding capacity of TRC101 and the polymer’s extensive 
crosslinking provides size exclusion properties and selectivity for binding Cl- over ot her 
potential interfering anions.  The TRC101 mechanism of action involves binding of H+ and 
Cl-, resulting in a net reduction and removal of hydrochloric acid from the GI tract which 
results in an increase in serum bicarbonate levels.  Binding Cl- in addition to H+  reduces 
exchange of Cl- with bicarbonate in the GI lumen, preventing a subsequent decrease in serum 
bicarbonate.  
The TRC101 drug substance is packaged in individual-dose packets  without addition of any 
excipients  to create the clinical study material (i.e., drug product), a powder for oral 
suspension also c
alled TRC101. 
1.3 Relevant  Non
clinical Background 
1.3.1 Nonclinical Pharmacology 
Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated robust proton and chloride 
binding and removal
 by the TRC101 polyamine polymer.  In vitro studies have demonstrated 
that TRC101 selectively binds and retain s HCl  under conditions that mimic the pH, exposure 
times , and ionic content of various compartments of the GI tract.  The marked binding 
capacity and selectivity for HCl observed with TRC101 in vitro translates into in vivo 
pharmacological effects.  When TRC101 was packaged in nylon sachets, fed to a single pig, and then recovered from collected feces, analysis of the anions bound to the recovered 
polymer r evealed an in vivo binding of 2.6 mEq of chloride pe
r gram of TRC101.  
Furthermore, removal of HCl by TRC101 results in a dose-dependent increase in mean serum 
bicarbonate , as obs
erved in rats with adenine-induced nephropathy and metabolic acidosis 
compared to untreated controls.   
1.3.2 Safety Pharm
acology 
The nonclinical Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) safety program for TRC101 includes three 
studies assessing safety pharmacology.  These assessments of the central nervous system  
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 20 of 80 (CNS), respiratory, cardiovascular (CV), and GI systems did not identify any TRC101-
related adverse effect s in rats up to 2 g/kg/day (GI)  or up to 4 g/kg/day (CNS, respiratory) 
and in dogs up to 2 g/kg/day (CV).   
1.3.3 Nonclinical ADME  
TRC101 is insoluble in both aqueous and organic solvents.  Due to its insolubility, stability , 
and size 
(averaging 100 
micrometers in diameter ), the polymer is not anticipated to be 
absorbed from
 the lumen of the GI tract.  To confirm lack of absorption following oral 
administration, the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of radiolabeled TRC101, in both rats and dogs, were characterized after a single oral dos e of 
[
14C]-TRC101.  The studies demonstrated no radioactivity in tissues or organs other than the 
GI tract, no detectable radiolabel in  the plasma, approximately 95 – 99% of the radioactive 
dose excreted in the feces with most recovered within the first 48 hours after dosing, and ≤ 0.02% of radiolabel excreted in the urine of dogs and rats.  The level of radioactivity excreted in urine was consistent with the level of unincorporated radiolabel measured in a water extraction of the radiolabeled polymer, [
14C]-TRC101.  Therefore, it can be concluded 
that TRC101 is  not systemically absorbed following oral administration in rats and dogs. 
1.3.4 Nonclinical Toxicology 
Nonclinical toxicology studies of TRC101 to date include non- Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP ) 7-day repeat dose toxic ology studies in rats and dogs; a GLP 33- day repeat dose 
toxic ology study with a 2 -week recovery in rats; a GLP 28 -day repeat dose toxicology study 
with a 2 -week recovery in dogs; GLP 13 -week repeat dose toxicology interim analyses  in the 
rat and the dog as part of the chronic toxicology studies, a screening non -GLP in vitro 
genotoxicity study (bacterial reverse mutation [Ames] assay), and two GLP in vitro 
genotoxicity studies (Ames assay and chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes); non- GLP pilot embryo -fetal development (EFD) studies in the rat and 
the rabbit; no single dose studies were conduc ted.  The oral route of exposure was selected 
for the repeat  dose toxicology and EFD studies in rats, rabbits, and/or dogs because this is the 
intended route of human exposure.  These studies demonstrate that TRC101 has a very low order of toxicity; the genotoxicity studies demonstrate that TRC101 is neither mutagenic nor 
clastogenic; the pilot EFD studies suggest that there are no adverse TRC101- related effects 
on maternal reproductive function or embryo -fetal parameters .  There were no effects on male 
or female reproductive organs in the GLP repeat dose toxicology  studies in rat and dog.  The no 
observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for the 13-week  repeat dose toxicology interim 
analyses  were the highest doses tested, i.e., 2 g/kg/day in rat s and dogs, providing support for 
up to 12 weeks of dosing in humans with TRC101 doses up to 9 g/day.  In the same studies, 
local tolerance was assessed, and histopathological evaluation of the GI tract indicated that 
TRC101 was generally well tolerated.   Tricida has received a waiver from the Food and Drug 
Administration  (FDA ) for the conduct of the in vivo micronucleous assay, the male and female 
fertility and early embryonic development study in rats , and the peri - and post -natal 
developmental study in rats.  No carcinogenicity studies of TRC101 have been conducted.

1.4.1 Study TRCA-101 
To date, TRC101 has been studied in one Phase 1/2 clinical trial, Study TRCA-101, 
in subjects with CKD Stage 3 – 4 (estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] 20 to  
< 60 mL/min/1.73m2) and baseline serum bicarbonate levels of 12 to 20 mEq/L.  Study 
TRCA -101 was a double-blind, placebo -controlled, parallel-design, 6-arm, fixed dose study, 
evaluating the safety and efficacy of three doses of TRC101 (3, 6 and 9 g/day) and two 
dosing regimens (once daily [QD] and twice daily [BID]) versus placebo.  Subjects en rolled 
in Study TRCA-101 were treated for 2  weeks while in residence at the clinical research units , 
after which they were  discharged  and followed for up to an additional 2 weeks  (off 
treatment ).  While in residence during the treatment period, subjects ate a standardized study 
diet controlled for protein and caloric content, as well as anions, cations and fiber, in accordance with dietary recommendations for CKD patients  (KDOQI, 2002 ).  Care was 
taken to ensure the diet was neither acidic nor basic.  The specific foods selected for the 
menus were chosen to closely approximated the regions’ typical diet.  The primary objective 
of the study was to assess the  safety and tolerability of TRC101.  The main efficacy endpoint 
was change from baseline (CFB) to end -of-treatment in serum bicarbonate level.  
The study population comprised 135 subjects (86 male and 49 female), with a mean age of 
60.3 years  (range of 30 to 79 years) , a mean baseline eGFR  of 34.8 mL/min/1.73m
2 (range of 
19 to 66 mL/min/1.73m2; 44.4% with CKD Stage 4)  and a mean baseline serum bicarbonate 
level of 17.7 mEq/L (range of 14.1 – 20.4 mEq/L) .  Subjects  had baseline comorbidities 
common in CKD patients, including hypertension (93.3%), diabetes ( 69.6%), left ventricular 
hypertrophy (28.9%), and congestive heart failure (21.5%).  As would be expected in a CKD 
Stage 3 – 4 population, nearly all study subjects had indications for sodium restriction:  
hypertension (93.3%), congestive heart failure ( 21.5%), periphe ral edema ( 14.1%) and use of 
diuretics ( 42.2%).   Because TRC101 does not result in sodium load as discussed in 
Section  1.2, enrollment of such subjects was appropriate. 
1.4.1.1 Safety  
A 14 -day t reatment with TRC10 1, at doses of 1.5, 3 or 4.5 g BID, or 6 g QD, appeared to be 
safe and generally well tolerated.  I n the 135 subjects who participated  (104 subjects in the 
TRC101 combined group and 31 subjects in the placebo group), there were no deaths, adverse events resulting in treatment discontinuation, or serious adverse events  (SAEs).  The 
overall incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was 53.8% in the TRC101 
combined group (26.9% assessed as related to study drug) of and 45.2% in the placebo group 
(12.9% assessed as related to study drug) .  The majority of reported TEAE s were mild  in 
severity : 44.2% in the TRC101 combined group (26.0% assessed as related to study drug) 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 22 of 80 and 35.5% in the placebo group (12.9% ass essed as related to study drug ).  Fewer TEAEs 
were reported as moderate: 9.6% in the TRC101 combined group (1.0% assessed as related 
to study drug) and 9.7% in the placebo group (none assessed as related ).  No severe or SAEs  
were reported  in either treatment group . 
The most commo n adverse events (≥ 5% incidence) in the TRC101- treated subjects were 
diarrh oea (20.2%), headache ( 7.7%), constipation (6.7%), and hyperglyc aemia  (6.7%).  The 
most common adverse events in the placebo-treated subje cts were diarrh oea (12.9%), 
glomeru lar filtration rate decreased ( 6.5%), blood glucose increased (6.5%), and 
hypoglycaemia (6.5%) .  No event appeared to be dose- related.  
Gastrointestinal (GI)  adverse events were the most commonly reported in TRC101- treated 
subjects, which is consistent with a non-absorbed drug acting primarily within the GI  tract, 
and all were mild or moderate in severity .  Diarrh oea was the most common adverse event; 
all events were mild, self -limited, of short duration, often resolving w hile study treatment 
was ongoing, and none required treatment or resulted in discontinuation of study drug or 
early withdrawal from the study.  Diarrh oea events exhibited no apparent dose response, 
occurring in 36.0%, 12.0%, 23.1% of subjects in the 1.5, 3, and 4.5 g BID TRC101 dose 
groups, respectively , and in 10.7% of subjects in the 6 g QD TRC101 group.  In the pooled 
placebo group diarrhoea occurred in 12.9% of subjects.  Given the small numbers, there is 
likely no difference between the groups. 
No tren ds suggest ed an off -target effect of TRC101 on other electrolytes (i.e., sodium, 
potassium, magnesium, calcium or phosphate).  N o treatment -related effect on serum 
chloride levels or any effect on urine electrolytes  was observed .  No subject experienced 
increases in serum bicarbonate that resulted in metabolic alkalosis (i.e., serum bicarbonate 
> 29 mEq/L).  There were also no trends suggesting an effect of TRC101 on renal function, 
liver function, lipids, vital signs or ECG intervals.  
For additional detail s regarding the safety data from Study TRCA -101, see the TRC101 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.4.1.2 Efficacy  
Over a 2 -week treatment period, TRC101 significantly increased serum bicarbonate levels in 
the study population of CKD patients with baseline serum bicarbonate levels ranging from 
14.1 to 20.4 mEq/L.  TRC101 had a rapid onset of action (i.e., statistically significant increase in mean within group CFB  in serum bicarbonate ; p < 0.0001) within the first 24  – 48 
hours following the initiation of treatment for all TRC101 dose groups combined.  The onset 
of action for between -group differences (active vs. placebo ) appeared  to occur between  
48 – 72 hours after the initiation of treatment with TRC101.  At Day 4  (72 hours after the 
first dose of TRC101), the mean increase in  serum bicarbonate from baseline for each 
TRC101 group was 1  – 2 mEq/L:  1.5 g BID  (p = 0.0011); 3 g BID (p = 0.0001); 6 g QD 
(p = 0.0003); 4.5 g BID (p < 0.0001).

Confidential   Page 23 of 80 At Day 15, a ll active doses/dosing regimens evaluated (1.5, 3 and 4.5 g TRC101 BID and 6 g 
TRC101 QD) showed statistically significantly (p < 0.0001) increased mean serum 
bicarbonate levels from baseline by approximately 3 – 4 mEq/L and each dose increased 
serum bicarbonate levels to a significantly (p  < 0.0001) greater extent than placebo .  The 
observed increase in serum bicarbonate in each TRC101 dose group did not appear to be 
dose- or dosing regimen-dependent, except for potentially earlier onset of action in the 
highest TRC101 group, 4.5 g BID.  
After 2 weeks of treatment, the TRC101 6 g QD dose group demonstrated a similar increase 
from baseline in serum bicarbonate compared to the TRC101 3 g BID dose group 
(3.51 mEq/L versus 2.98 mEq/L, respectively), and the difference between the QD and BID 
dosing regimens was not statistically significant (p  = 0.3408). 
Figure  1 illustrates the steady increase in mean serum bicarbonate observed in all TRC101 
dose groups during the 14- day treatment period with a mean increase at the end of treatment 
of approximately 3 to  4 mEq/L  across all active dose groups.  The slope of serum bicarbonate 
increase remained constant in all TRC101 dose groups, with no evidence of serum bicarbonate reaching a plateau at  the end of 2- week treatment.  Therefore, the maximal effect 
of each TRC101 dose tested in Study TRCA- 101 ha s not yet been determined.  Serum 
bicarbonate levels in the placebo group remained essentially unchanged throughout the study, 
suggesting that the diet with a controlled protein (0.66 g/kg/day on average) and cation/anion 
content administered in the clinical research unit matched well with  what the subjects  ate at 
home and, therefore,  had no significant impact on the ir serum bicarbonate values.  
The 2 -week treatment period in study TRCA-101 was followed by a 2-week follow-up 
period during which subjects were off treatment.  Following discontinuation of TRC101, serum bicarbonate levels  decreased within  2 days and were near their baseline values within 
9 days (Figure  1).  These results underscore the rapid reversibility of TRC101 effect .  In 
addition, the data demons trate that chronic nature of the underlying metabolic acidosis in 
these CKD patients  and suggest that continued treatment with TRC101 would be needed to 
maintain elevated serum bicarbonate level.

1.5 Description and Justification for Route of Administration, Dosage, 
Dosage Regimen and Treatment Period  
In this study, TRC101 will be administered orally, as a powder suspended in water, QD  with 
food.  TRC101 is a high molecular weight, nonabsorbed polymer with a site of action in the 
GI tract ; thus, oral administration is the appropriate route.  A d ose of 6 g QD TRC101 was 
chosen as the starting dose for this study  since it was shown  to be safe, well tolerated, and 
efficacious in Study TRCA-101 (along with the 1.5 g BID, 3 g BID  and 4.5 g BID TRC101 
doses).  A starting dose of  6 g provides the option of bidirectional dose adjustment (i.e., up or 
down titration), thus potentially allowing greater flexibility in controlling blood bicarbonate 
levels compared to  a 3 g or 9 g st arting dose.  A QD dosing regimen is more convenient for 
study subjects than a BID dosing regimen and therefore may result in greater compliance 
during a 12-week treatment period.  P lacebo  QD will be used as a comparator .  Additional 
details on the rationale for the doses, dosing regimen and treatment period are provided in Section 3.2. 
1.6 Description of Population to be Studied  
In the completed Study TRCA-101, the allowable ranges for eGFR and blood bicarbonate were 20 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m
2 and 12 to 20 mEq/L, respectively.  The population studied in 
this clinical study is CKD patients with chronic metabolic acidosis who have eGFR from 20 

TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 25 of 80 to 40 mL/min/1.73m2 and blood bicarbonate levels from  12 to  20 mEq/L.  At least half of the 
subjects enrolled will have blood bicarbonate level of 12 to 18 mEq/L. 
This study is designed to provide significant overlap with the population investigated in 
Study TRCA -101 and in future investigational studies of TRC101. 
The lower limit of the bicarbonate range is intended to exclude patients who are acutely 
acidotic as their management is largely aimed at rapid treatment of the underlying etiology of 
the acidosis.  Whereas clinical practice guidelines also recommend treating milder acidosis 
(serum bicarbonate > 20 to 22 mEq/L) ( KDIGO 2013 ; KDOQI 2 003), the population for the 
current study will include only those with blood bicarbonate 12 to 20 mEq/L.  This is to ensure that all subjects have significant metabolic acidosis . 
To make the study more generalizable to the intended target population of CK D patients, this 
study will be conducted in outpatients whose dietary intake is not mandated by the study 
protocol, unlike the in- unit TRCA -101 study which used a controlled diet.  Additionally, 
compared with the TRCA-101 study, exclusions for common concomitant medications such as H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been removed from this protocol, and subjects with more severe heart failure (i.e., NYHA Class III) may be enrolled   
(see Appendix 3). 
This protocol allows the use of “background” medications that can affect eGFR and blood bicarbonate (e.g ., oral alkali, calcium  supplements, diuretics, renin angiotensin aldosterone 
system [RAAS] inhibitors) with some restrictions .   Doses of alkali  medications may not be 
changed  and new oral alkali therapies must not be initiated during the study.  If a subject 
requires treatment for sustained, clinically -significant worsening of metabolic acidosis during 
the study in the judgment of the Investigator, diet counseling (i.e., reduced protein intake, vegetarian/vegan protein sources) may  be implemented  as clinically appropriate and in 
agreement with the Medical Monitor .  Subjects with confirm ed blood bicarbonate decrease 
< 12 mEq/L should be investigated for possible causes of acute-on-chronic acidosis and the Investigator should discuss these cases with the Medical Monitor.  The rationale for 
allowance of alkali treatment is to avoid significan tly worsening acidosis among the placebo 
subjects; however, maintaining a stable dose of such treatments is necessary to avoid 
confounding of the primary efficacy measurement.  Subjects may be, but are not required to be, on RAAS inhibitor(s) at Baseline.  Investigators will be advised to avoid changing RAAS 
inhibitor doses during the study, when possible, but dose changes necessary for the management of comorbidities or acute events (e.g., hyperkalemia/ worsening hyperkalemia ) 
are not prohibited.  Investiga tors will be advised to avoid changing diuretic doses when 
possible, but dose changes necessary for the management of comorbidities or acute events 
(e.g.,  heart failure , acute kidney injury) are not prohibited.

Confidential   Page 26 of 80 The rationale for  the above restriction on background concomitant medications that may 
affect eGFR in this study is to gain experience with this aspect of the study design which 
may be used in a future study evaluating the rate of eGFR decline. 
1.7 Description of Assay Methodology for Measurement of B lood/Serum 
Bicarbonate Concentration  
Bicarbonate concentrations in venous blood will be assessed in this study usin g the i-STAT 
System (handheld blood analyzer with G3+ cartridge manufactured by Abbott Point of Care, 
Princeton, NJ) in all subjects .  In addition,  either a clinical chemistry analyzer performing 
enzymatic measurement of bicarbonate in serum  or a benchtop venous blood gas analyzer for 
measuring bicarbonate will be used consistent ly for each subject .  These assays (with  the i-
STAT assay and one of two other assays being mandatory) will be conducted at the local 
laboratory or at the study site.  
All efficacy analyses will be conducted using bicarbonate concentrations collected from the i-STAT devices.  The i-STAT measurements of blood bicarbonate l evels will be the basis of 
study drug dose adjustment decisions.  Data from the other assay methodolog y (either 
enzymatic or venous blood gas bicarbonate analysis) will be evaluated  in an exploratory 
manner . 
The two blood gas analysis methods (benchtop and i- STAT ) provide a calculated bicarbonate 
concentration from measurement of pH and pCO
2 in a whole blood sample.  The enzymatic 
assay method used in most clinical laboratories directly measures the total CO 2 (bicarbonate 
+ dissolved CO 2) concentration in a serum sample using an assay that relies upon the 
conversion of dissolved CO 2 to HCO 3- with base, followed by a series of enzymatic reactions 
resulting in a decrease in the 380/410 nm absorbance of the reacti on mixture . 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Efficacy  
This study is intended to evaluate the efficacy of TRC101 in CKD patients with metabolic 
acidosis  (blood bicarbonate 12 to 20 mEq/L). 
2.2 Safety  
This study is intended to evaluate the safety of administration of TRC101 in CKD patients 
with metabolic acidosis  (blood bicarbonate 12 to 20 mEq/L).

Confidential   Page 28 of 80 urine samples will be performed in a fasting state pre-dose.  Following randomization, 
designated unblinded s ite staff will assist the subject in administering the first dose of study 
drug, which will be taken onsite in the morning with food (light meal or snack)  after 
collection of baseline laboratory specimens.  Subjects will be given a dosing diary in which 
to record the time of study drug dosing. 
Subjects will continue dosing on an out-patient basis for the subsequent 12 weeks (Treatment 
Period).  Dosing of oral c oncomitant medications and study drug will be separated by at least 
4 hours.  The s tudy drug dose will be fixed during the first 4 weeks of the Treatment Period , 
except for subjects with  blood bicarbonate ≥ 27 mEq/L .  Subjects with a blood bicarbonate 
level of 27 to 30 mEq/L will have their dose of study drug decreased per the blinded titration 
algorithm (see Appendix 2).   Subjects with a confirmed blood bicarbonate level of 
> 30 mEq/L  will undergo an interruption of the study drug dose in accordance with the 
titration algorithm ( see Appendix 2).  Beginning at the Week 4 Visit, subjects with a blood 
bicarbonate level below the normal range (< 22 mEq/L) will have a blinded  adjustment of the 
study drug dose in accordance with the titration algorithm (see Appendix 2).  At any time during the study, s ubjects with confirmed  blood bicarbonate level < 12 mEq/L will be 
evaluated by the Investigator for new acute acidotic processes and discussed with the Medical Monitor.  The Medical Monitor will determine whether the subject may continue in the study. 
During the 12- week Treatment Period, subjects will attend  eight  study visits ( Day 1, 
Weeks  1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) for efficacy and safety assessments.  Subjects  will be  fasted 
(other than water) for at least 4 hours  prior to blood draws.  Assessments will be performed at 
the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1).  Safety assessmen ts will 
include:  adverse events (AEs), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and respiratory rate); physical examination (including body weight); clinical laboratory testing (Table 2), and 12- lead ECG s.  Efficacy will be assessed by examining changes in blood 
bicarbonate. 
Subjects who complete the Treatment Period will be offered participation in a 40- week 
extension study (TRCA-301E).  Subjects who are not willing to participate in the extension 
study or who are not eligible will enter the 2 -week Follow -up Period and return to the study 
site for two visits: Follow -up 1 ( Week 13) and Follow-up 2 (Week 14), for adverse event 
collection, fasting blood draws and safety assessments as outlined in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1).  Subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely (i.e., prior to the Week 12 
Visit) will undergo an Early Termination (ET) Visit during which all Week 12 Visit 
assessments will be performed , followed by Follow-up 1 and 2 Visits in 1 and 2 weeks, 
respectively .  Blood draws for bicarbonate measurements will be done when subjects  are in a 
fasted state and at approximately the same time of day for each subject.  
See Appendix 1, Schedule of Events, for further informatio n on the conduct of the study.

Confidential   Page 29 of 80 3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
3.2.1 Study Design  
This study is randomized to reduce bias.  Because no approved treatment  is available  for 
chronic metabolic acidosis , placebo was chosen as the comparator .  Furthermore , a 
comparison to placebo allows for better characterization  of the efficacy and safety of new 
chemical entities.  However, due to the chronicity and severity of the baseline metabolic 
acidosis in this 12- week study, s ubjects receiving oral alkali treatment at baseline will be 
allowed to continue on this treatment at stable doses to avoid significant worsening of 
acidosis in the placebo -treated subjects . 
The Investigators, site personnel (except for designated unblinded staff responsible for study 
drug dispensing and accountability ), subjects, Tricida , contr act research organization (CRO) 
personnel (except for those responsible for unblinded moni toring) will be blinded to reduce 
bias.  The data monitoring committee ( DMC ) members  and the statisticians responsible for 
reporting to the DMC will be unblinded during the study.  A blinding plan will describe the 
specific requirements for maintaining the  blind at the site and sites will be trained on these 
requirements . 
In the completed Study TRCA-101, treatment with TRC101 for 2 weeks resulted in a significant increase in serum bicarbonate in all three  doses studied (3, 6 and 9 g/day) 
(Section  1.4.1.2
); however, the maximum effect of each of these fixed doses was not 
determined.  At the end of 2 weeks, all three BID dosing re gimens ( 1.5 g, 3 g, and 4.5 g) as 
well as the QD dosing regimen (6 g) appeared to be similarly effective based on mean 
changes from baseline in serum bicarbonate after 2 weeks .  However, a greater proportion of 
subjects receiving  3 g BID and 4.5 g BID  achieved larger increases in blood bicarbonate 
(e.g., ≥ 4 mEq/L) than the lowe st 1.5 g BID dose.  Based on these findings, the mid -dose 
(i.e., 6 g QD ) was selected as the starting dose for this study .  The  subjects whose blood 
bicarbonate is below the normal range after 4 weeks of fixed -dose treatment will have their 
dose up- titrated to 9 g QD while the blind  is maintained .  Given that no dose- related adverse 
events  occurred  in Study TRCA-301, this dosing regimen was chosen to optimize eff icacy 
while examining the plateau effect of 6 g QD TRC101 over 4 weeks, the sustained efficacy 
of TRC101 over 12 weeks, and the effects of dose adjustment. 
A QD dosing regimen was selected  to simplif y administration of concomitant medications 
and to enhanc e compliance and convenience.  Study drug will be administered in the middle 
of the day, with lunch, so as to facilitate  maintaining  at least  a 4-hour interval between dosing 
with study drug and  oral concomitant medications.  
3.2.2 Safety Monitoring  
The design and conduct of TRCA-301 includes appropriate monitoring for safety and risk mitigation.  The Medical Monitor will review blinded safety data on an ongo ing basis to 
identify potential adverse safety trends.  Central laboratory reports will contain flags tha t will 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 30 of 80 alert investigators and Tricida personnel to abnormal, critical, and exclusionary laboratory 
values, and the Medical Monitor will routinely review these results  on an ongoing basis. 
A DMC , which will be established for this study, will review safety during the study.  The 
DMC will  comprise, at a minimum, one biostatistician and two clinicians, at least one of 
whom is a nephrologist.  The responsibilities of the DMC will be defined in a written charter, 
which will include the meeting schedule, format and structure, and the use of treatment 
codes.   Study enrollment and study activities will continue during DMC safety reviews.   The 
Chairperson of the DMC will be a nephrologist. 
The DMC will be supported by an independent statistical group which will prepare unblinded 
analyses for the DMC and will have no role in the SAP after the study has started enrolling subjects.  A separate, blinded statistical group (i.e., not associated with the DMC) will be responsible for producing and finaliz ing the SAP and executing final data analys is of the 
study.  
TRC101 is a high molecular weight, counterion-free polymer.  It is not absorbed and does not circulate systemically.  Experience in Study TRCA -101 has shown that the anticipated 
risks of treatment with TRC101 are non-serious, mild to moderate, short- lived diarrhea or 
constipation, that generally resolves while treatment is ongoing.  A dverse events will be 
monitored throughout the study. 
Risks of TRC101 effects  on non- target substances (e.g., serum potassium, magnesium, 
calcium, phosphate, lipids) were not evident in  the clinical data from Study TRCA -101; 
nevertheless, close attention will be paid to electrolyte levels , which will be assessed at every 
study visit. No cases of  alkalosis  (i.e., serum bicarbonate > 29 mEq/L ) were observed in  Study 
TRCA -101.  However, an exaggerated pharmacological effect of TRC101 is theoretically 
possible, given the longer duration of treatment in this study.  While kidneys are generally 
efficient at excreting excess bi carbonate, the rapidity with which this can happen is impaired 
at low levels of renal function.   To avoid prolonged periods of blood bicarbonate above the 
normal range,  blood bicarbonate levels will be measured at every study visit and study drug 
dose will be blindly decreased  if blood bicarbonate level is 27 to  30 mEq/L and interrupted if 
blood bicarbonate is confirmed to be > 30 mEq/L.   It is known from Study TRCA -101 that 
the effects of TRC101 are rapidly reversible, with the majority of the effect lost within approximately 1 week of treatment discontinuation and with serum bicarbonate returning 
essentially back to baseline within approximately 2 weeks  of treatment discontinuation.  In 
addition, patients with higher risk of inhibition of respiratory response to metabolic acidosis (i.e., COPD that is treated with chronic oral steroids, that requires the subject to be on oxygen, or that required hospitalization within the previous 6 months ) will be excluded from 
this study.

Confidential   Page 31 of 80 Among subjects randomized to placebo, in particular, a decrease in bicarbonate during the 
12-week Treatment P eriod is a possibility, particularly if dietary acid load increases or renal 
function deteriorates.  This  protocol r equires that the Investigat or evaluate subjects whose 
blood bicarbonate decreases to < 12 mEq/L for possible causes of acute-on- chronic acidosis 
and discuss these cases with the Medical Monitor regarding continuation of the subject in the 
study. 
3.3 Study Duration  
The maximum study duration is anticipated to be up to 16 weeks  per subject, including the 
Screening Period (up to 2 weeks ), 12-week  Treatment Period , and 2- week  Follow-up Period .  
The maximum TRCA -301 study duration for subjects who continue into the extension Study 
TRCA -301E will be 14 weeks (excluding 2- week Follow -up Period).

4.4 Subject Withdrawal 
Within the provisions of informed consent and good clinical judgment with respect to the 
subject’s safety, every attempt should be made to have subjects complete both the Treatment 
Period and Follow-up Period.  All subjects will be informed that they have the right to 
withdraw from the study at any time.   If a subject discontinues from the study prematurely

be followed for safety for 2 weeks after receiving the last dose of study drug.  If the subject is 
being withdrawn because of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the reason for withdrawal.  The Investigat or and the Medical Monitor may exercise his or her medical judgment to  
discontinue a subject’s participation in the study at any time if medically necessary.   
Subjects who meet  any of  the following criteria at any time during the study must be 
withdrawn from the study and should be medically managed as per standard of care by the 
Investigator: 
• Occurrence of any AE, intercurrent illness or abnormality in laboratory assessment 
results which, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor, warrants the 
subject’s permanent discontinuation of the study drug treatment. 
• Treatment with a prohibited concomitant medication.  Subjects who require a prohibited concomitant medication for the treatment of an AE or for a short duration may continue on study drug treatment if approved by the Medical Monitor (see Section 5.9 for details) .

Confidential   Page 35 of 80 • Subject ’s noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the study  schedule, 
study drug self- administration  or procedures, that cannot be rectified through additional 
training or other means. 
• At the request of Tricida , IRB/IEC or regulatory authority.  
• Withdrawal of consent by subject to participate in the study.  Subjects should be 
encouraged to complete an Early Termination Visit, even if they are withdrawing consent, to ensure adequate safety follow -up. 
• Subject is lost to follow -up (the subject did not return for visits and study personnel were 
unable to contact the subject after at least three documented attempts ). 
• Received d ialysis  or underwent renal transplantation. 
• Pregnancy.  These subjects will be followed until the outcome of pregnancy is known and 
if subject agrees (see Section 6.12).  
Subjects with confirm ed bicarbonate < 12 mEq/L should be evaluated by the Investigator for 
new acute acidotic processes and discussed with the Medical Monitor.  The Medical Monitor 
will determine whether the subject may continue in the study.  The subject should be maintained on their study drug dose pending discussion with Medical Monitor
. 
Subjects who withdraw from the study treatment prematurely prior to the Week 12 visit will 
undergo an ET Visit and will be asked to attend two follow-up visits.   
It is important to collect information explaining why subjects withdrew from the study.  This 
information, together with AEs occurring at those times, may be very informative of the cause-specific reasons for why some subjects remain in the study or on the assigned treatment while o thers do not.  Therefore, although subjects are not obliged to give their 
reason for withdrawing consent, the Investigator will make a reasonable effort to obtain the reason while fully respecting the subjects’ rights.  Reasons for withdrawal of consent, when provided by the subject, will be recorded in the eCRF.  The procedures described for ET  
from the study  (Section 7.8) will be performed if possible.  Every effort will be made to 
contact a subject who fails to attend a Study Visit, or does not respond by telephone, in order to ensure that the subject is in satisfactory health.  The Investigator will immediately inform the Medical Monitor of removal or early withdrawal of a subject from the study. 
Subjects withdrawn from the study for any reason will not be replaced. 
5 STUDY TREATMENT(S)  
5.1 Description of Treatment(s)  
5.1.1 Investigational Drug  
TRC10 1 is packaged in labeled packets  and dispensed in cartons containing eight (8) packets  
each.  Refer to the current version of the TRC101 Investigator’s Brochure for a more detailed 
description of the investigational drug.

Placebo consist s of , National Formulary ( NF) Grade, and is  
packa ged in labeled packets  and dispensed in cartons containing eight (8)  packets  each .   
5.1.3 Study Drug Dispensing , Packing and Labeling 
Labelled c artons of TRC101 and placebo  will be shipped to the study site  where they will be 
stored at room temperature (15 to 25 °C) in a secure location.  
Study drug will be dispensed by the unblinded Pharmacist or study staff member  designated 
for this role  by the Investigator (hereafter referred to as “the Pharmacist”) according to the 
subject’s treatment assignment.  The  exact dispensing instruction s will be provided to the 
Pharmacist  by the interactive response technology (IRT) system .   
The Pharmacist will be responsible for maintaining complete study drug dispensing, 
returning, and dosing records for each study subject enrolled at the site .  
5.2 Treatment (s) Administered  
Randomization will be performed using the IRT system .  Approximately 210 subjects will be 
randomized in a 4:3 ratio to one of the following treatments : 
• 6 g TRC101 QD (n~120) 
• Placebo QD (n~90) 
Subjects with blood bicarbonate values of 12 to 18 mEq/L will be randomized without 
restriction.  Once 105 subjects with blood bicarbonate values of > 18 to 20 mEq/L at baseline 
(i.e., average of Screening Visit 1, Screening Visit 2, and pre-dose Day 1 val ues) have been 
enrolled, randomization may be closed to additional subjects with baseline blood bicarbonate 
in this range. 
TRC101 or placebo will be administered orally as an aqueous suspension, QD with lunch, for 
12 weeks.   The Investigator will designate an unblinded Pharmacist to dispense and account for study 
drug and to train subjects on study drug preparation and administration.  The first dose of 
TRC101 or placebo will be administered at the study site in the morning with food (light 
meal or snack) and under the supervision of the P harmacist  after the baseline blood samples 
have been drawn.  The Pharmacist  will train the subject o n how to administer the study drug  
in accordance with the subject dosing instructions. 
Subjects will record the  timing of study drug dosing in a dosing diary .  Subjects will be 
instructed  to take any oral concomitant treatment at least 4 hours before or after study drug 
administration.  Subjects will be instructed to bring the completed dosing diary with them to 
each visit to the study site.  

TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 37 of 80 The last dose of study drug will be taken the day before the Week 12 Visit (subjects who 
continue into the extension Study TRCA-301E will continue study drug dosing per the extension study protocol). 
5.3 Dosing Regimen 
The study drug dose titration algorithm is described in Appendix 2.  Dose titrations  can only 
be performed during a clinic visit.  If the dose of study drug is changed , the subject will start 
the new dose at lunch time on the titration day.  Dose titrations should be performed on the 
basis of onsite i- STAT blood bicarbonate measurements only.  
The study drug dose will be fixed for the first 4 weeks of the Treatment Period (d uring this 
time each subject will receive the study drug dose assigned at randomization [Baseline 
Visit]); no study drug dose adjustments will be permitted before the Week 4 Visit , except for 
subjects with elevation of blood bicarbonate ≥ 27 mEq/L.  If the  blood bicarbonate level is 27 
to 30 mEq/L at any time during the Treatment Period through Week 11, the study drug dose will be decreased by 1 packet/day (minimum dose is 0 packets/day).  Beginning at the Week 
4 Visit, subjects with a blood bicarbonate level below the normal range (< 22  mEq/L) will 
have a blinded adjustment of the study drug dose in accordance with the titration algorithm 
(see Appendix 2).  The study drug dose will only be titrated if NO dose changes have been 
made during the previous 14 days.  If blood bicarbonate is confirmed to be > 30 m Eq/L  at 
any time during the study , the study drug treatment will be interrupted, no study drug will be 
dispensed to the subject, and the subject will be invited for a visit in approximately 1 week to retest blood bicarbonate .  If blood bicarbonate decreases to < 27 mEq/L and the subject is 
still within the Treatment Period, study drug should be re- started at a lower dose in 
accordance with the titration algorithm (see Appendix 2).  If blood bicarbonate is 
≥ 27 mEq/L, the study drug dosing should be withheld until blood bicarbonate is 
< 27 mEq /L. 
No dose titration will be allowed after Week 11 (i.e., 77 days after the day of the first dose).  Dose titrations are blinded. 
The Medical Monitor must be notified within 24 hours of confirmation of a bicarbonate value 
> 30 mEq/L  or < 12 mEq/L.  Dose interruptions due to blood bicarbonate elevations should 
be performed on the basis of i- STAT measurements , except in unusual situations when they 
may be based on confirmed non-i- STAT blo od bicarbonate values > 30 mEq/L, e.g., if  
i-STAT v alues cannot be obtained because the subject is hospitalized.  
5.4 Missed Doses  
Contact the Medical Monitor if a subject has missed more than three consecutive doses of 
study drug  for any reason.  
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 38 of 80 5.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
Subjects will be randomly assigned by the IRT system to one of the available  treatment 
regimens at the Baseline Visit.  The dose of study drug may be uptitrated  at or after the 
Week  4 Visit and throughout the Treatment Period until Week 11 (77 days after the first dose 
of study drug) for blood bicarbonate levels (refer to Appendix 2).   Study drug will be 
administered as an oral suspension in water with lunch, QD f rom the Baseline Visit through 
1 day prior to the Week 12 Visit.  If a dose of study drug is adjusted, the subject will start the 
new dose at lunch time on the titration day.   
Dosing times for study drug will be collected by the subject on the dosing diary and recorded 
on the eCRF. 
5.6 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
When a subject who has met all eligibility  criteria for the study is identified , the subject will 
be randomized using the IRT system  at the Baseline Visit (Day 1) .  The IRT system will 
randomly assign the subject to one of the two treatment groups ( placebo or 6 g TRC101) with  
stratification  by baseline blood bicarbonate (≤ 18 mEq/L vs. > 18 mEq/L) and screening  
eGFR (< 30 mL/min/1.73m2 vs. ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m2), which represents an average of two 
eGFR values obtained at Screening 1 and Screening 2 Visit .   
The randomization treatment assignment will be performed by the IRT system in a blinded 
manner and the treatment randomization codes for the stud y will be maintained by the 
IRT system . 
5.7 Blinding  
In this study,  
 an unblinded 
Pharmacist  or designated  unblinded study staff member  (the “Pharmacist”)  for handling 
(dispensation and collection) of the study drug.  These individuals will be responsible for dispensing study drug  (including supervision of administration of the first dose of study 
drug) and collecting used and unused study drug co ntainers and dosing diaries.  If study drug 
dose needs to be adjusted or interrupted per the titration algorithm (see Appendix 2), such adjustments will be performed in a blinded manner in both active and placebo treatment groups.  The Pharmacist  must not have any  other  responsibilities for the study except for 
performing study drug dispensation and collection,  assessing dosing com pliance and 
performing drug accountability  and entering related data in eCRF .  The subject s, 
Investigators, Medical Monitors, Tricida,  site personnel (including all those involved in 
collection of safety and efficacy information) and CRO staff  (except for those responsible for 
monitoring of unblinded data ) will remain blinded to the subject’s treatment assignment.  The 
DMC members and the statisticians responsible for reporting to the DMC will be unblinded  
during the study. 

TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 39 of 80 The Pharmacist must not inform the subject s, Investigators, Medical Monitors, Tricida , or 
other site or CRO  personnel about the subjects’ treatment assignment.  In case of a medical 
emergency, the Investigator may obtain the treatment assignment for the subject from the 
IRT system if it is considered important to the management of a medical emergency.  In such 
cases, the Investigator must submit a written report, including all pertinent details, to a 
Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the unblinding.  The Investigator should make every 
reasonable attempt to contact a Medical Monitor before unblinding the subject. 
5.8 Concomitant Therapy  
Information on prior and concomitant medication s (including prescription, over -the-counter, 
herbal and naturopathic remedies, etc.) will be collected beginning at the Screening 1 Visit 
and continuing for the duration of the study (including ET) until the last study visit.  A 
therapy will be considered a concomitant medication if it is administered at any  time after 
randomization (Day 1) and before the completion of the final s tudy visit.  A therapy will be 
considered a prior medication if it is administered at any time during the 28  days prior to the 
Screening  1 Visit and during the Screening Period (until randomization). 
Subjects will be instructed  to take any oral concomitant treatment at least 4 hours before or 
after study drug administration . 
If a subject requires a medication, or a change in the dose of a current medication, for 
treatment of any condition or AE that occurs during the study (including the Screening, Treatment and Follow-up Periods), such medication(s), or the new doses, and the adverse event (s) [AE(s)] will be recorded on the eCRF . 
5.9 Restricted Medications  
In general, subjects should continue on regular doses of their usual medications.  Subjects who are receiving or who have recently received restricted drugs or drug classes prio r to the 
Screening 1 Visit  should adhere to restrictions as described in Table 1.  The rationale for the 
restrictions on concomitant medications is provided in Sectio n 1.6.   
Changes to alkali treatment are not  allowed.
   
Investigators will be advised to avoid changing doses of RAAS inhibitors or diuretics when possible.  However, RAAS inhibitor dose decreases or discontinuation necessary for the 
management of comorbidities or acute events  (e.g., hyperkalemia/ worsening hyperkalemia ) 
and diuretic dose increases necessary for the management of comorbidities or acute events 
(e.g., heart failure , acute kidney injury ) are not prohibited.   
The use of polymer binder drugs is  not allowed during the study; however, use of a 
potassium binder (e.g., Veltassa or Kayexalate) for a sh ort duration (e.g., up to 4 days on up 
to two separate occasions) for the management of hyperkalemia is permitted without

clinical management of the subject, contact a Medical Monitor for approval unless medical urgency precludes  
this. In all cases, notify a Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the change.   “Stable dose” is defined as no 
starting or s topping of these medications and no change in dose.  For diuretics, dose changes of up to ± 50% 
relative to the average dose during the Screening Period are considered “stable”.  A dose change up to ± 50% 
between the Screening 1 Visit and the Baseline Visit is considered “stable”.

5.10.1 Prior Therapy 
Restrictions regarding  prior therapy are as described under Exclusion Criteria ( Section  4.3) 
and in Table 1. 
5.10.2 Fluid and Food Intake  
For laboratory measurements requiring fasting  (including all measurements of blood 
bicarbonate) , a minimum period of fasting (water allowed) should be at least 4 hours.  
Subjects should be questioned about their most recent food intake at each visit and the 
information documented in the source documents. 
5.10.3 Management of Acidemia (Use of Alkali Therapy) 
Subjects may be on a stable dose of oral alkali therapy at Baseline; however, this dose must 
be kept constant and new oral alkali therapies may not be initiated during the study.  If the 
Investigator judges that a subject requires treatment for sustained, clinically -significant 
worsening of metabolic acidosis during the study, diet counseling (i.e., reduced protein intake, vegetarian/vegan protein sources) may be implemented as clinically appropriate and in agreemen t with the Medical Monitor.  Subjects w ith confirmed blood bicarbonate decrease 
< 12 mEq/L should be investigated for possible causes of acute-on-chronic acidosis and the 
Investigator should discuss these cases with the Medical Monitor.  The subject’s stud y drug 
dose should be maintained pending discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
5.11 Treatment Compliance  
The Pharmacist  will assess subjects’ treatment compliance at every study visit during the 
12-week Treatment Period to confirm that the subject is taking study drug according to the 
protocol instructions and to document compliance in the eCRF as detailed in the eCRF  
completion guidelines.  Compliance will be assessed on the basis of the assigned study drug 
dose, the duration of treatment, and the quantity of dispensed and returned containers (used and unused).  The dosing diary data collected from the study subjects will be used as  a 
secondary means for assessing compliance.   Supervised s tudy drug dosing on Day 1 at the 
study site will occur to ensur e subject compliance with dosing instructions.  S ubjects will be 
provided with a dosing diary and will be requested to record the time when study drug was 
taken  and the number of packets taken .  Subjects will be  instructed to save their 
opened/empty (used) study drug containers and bring them to the next study visit for 
compliance assessment along with any unopened containers.  The Pharmacist will not share 
any potentially unblinding information with the subject or any other party as described in 
Section  5.7.

All study drug suppl ies must be stored in a secure location  under the proper storage 
conditions, with access restricted to the Pharmacist  only.  Study drug must be stored at room 
temperature (15 to 25 °C). 
The Pharmacist  will verify and acknowledge receipt of study drug by signing and returning 
all required forms.  All study drug dispensed to subjects must be accurately captured in the 
drug accountability records (forms and/or logs) maintained at the study site .  A copy of these 
records must be returned to Tricida at  study completion for drug reconciliation  purposes.   
Study drug designated for this clinical study must not be administered to any subject other 
than those enrolled in this specific investigation, and may not be utilized for any laboratory or animal research.   Subjects should be instructed to return all st udy drug dispensed to them 
(including empty containers) at each post- baseline study visit during the Treatment Period.  
All used, unused, and expired medication and empty study drug containers  will be retained 
until the Study Close -Out Visit unless request ed earlier by  Tricida.  T ricida will provide 
instructions on where to return all used and unused study drug containers. 
6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Informed Consent  
A signed informed consent form ( ICF) must be obtained from each subject prior to any 
study-mandated procedure.  6.2 Demographics and Medical History  
The I nvestigator or qualified designee will collect subject’s demographics information and a 
complete medical and surgical history (including neurologic and psychiatri c) at the Screen ing 
1 Visit.  Medical history will include information on the subject ’s prior and concurrent 
medical conditions and methods of birth control, if applicable .  The Investigator or qualified 
designee will r ecord all findings in source documents, on the medica l history eCRF  and the 
concomitant medications eCRF, if applicable . 
6.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
At the Screening 1 Visit the I nvestigator or qualified designee will collect information 
regarding the subject’s prior prescription and non-prescription medications and nutritional 
supplements taken within 28 days.  The information on concomitant medications  will be 
collected at all subsequent visits during the study .  The Investigator or qualified designee will 
record all findings in source documents and on the concomitant medications  eCRF . 
6.4 Vital Signs  
The I nvestigator or qualified designee will measure vital signs (systolic/diastolic blood 
pressure  and respiratory rate [in triplicate with measurements recorded approximately

points] , heart rate, and temperature) at time p oints specified in the Schedule of Events 
(Appendix 1).  The same method for measurement of temperature (e.g ., oral, tympanic, 
axillary) should be used throughout the study for an individual subject.  Subjects must be in a 
supine, semi- fowler’s (semi -recumbent) or seated position in a rested and calm state for at 
least 5  minutes  before blood pressure assessments are conducted.  The same position must be 
used for blood pressure measurements for a given subject at each time point.  Respiratory 
rate will be assessed by a full minute count. 
All measurements will be recorded on the vital signs eCRF.  Abnormal measurements may 
be rep eated at the discretion of the Investigator and must be recorded  on the vital signs 
eCRF.  When collection of vital signs , ECG , and/or blood samples is required at the same 
visit, vital signs  should be performed first, followed by ECG and collection of blood samples. 
6.5 Complete Physical Examination, Including Body Weight and Height  
The I nvestigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical examination  
(including CV , lungs and chest, head and neck, abdomen, musculoskeletal, skin and 
neurological systems; genitourinary examination not required) and record body weight at the 
time p oints indicated in the Schedule of Events  (Appendix 1).  Height will be measured at the 
Screening 1 Visit only.  Pre-dose abnormal physical examination findings will be reported in 
the source documents and in the medical history eCRF .  Additiona l examination s should be 
performed where clinically appropriate.  Any new clinically significant physical examination 
abnormality identified during the study should be reported as an AE  and documented on the 
AE eCRF . 
6.6 Repeated Chair Stand Test  
The I nvestiga tor or qualified designee will administer the repeated chair stand  test 
(Guralnik; 1995) at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1).  The 
repeated chair stand test  at the Screening 1 Visit will be performed for subject’s training 
purposes only, without collecting the data.  The repeated chair stand test  in this study will be 
used as a measure of lower extremity muscle strength .  Site staff will be trained to perform 
the testing in a consistent manner.  The procedure details are provided in the Study Reference 
Manual. 
6.7 KDQOL  
The Investigator or qualified designee will collect  subjects’ answer s to the Kidney Disease 
and Quality of Life  (KDQOL)  Question 3 items (daily activities) at the time points indicated 
in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1).   The procedure details are provided in the Study

During the study, 12- lead ECGs will be performed at the time p oints indicated in the 
Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1).  If a subject has serum potassium ≥ 6.0 mEq/L at any time 
post-S creening, ECGs will be collected more often, as  clinically needed, until serum 
potassium is <  6.0 mEq/L. 
The subject must be in a supine position in a rested and calm state for at least 5 minutes 
before the ECG assessment is conducted.  S ubject s who are unable to be in the supine 
position should be in the most recumbent position possible. 
All ECGs should be performed with a standardized method, in triplicate, and approximately 
30 seconds apart, prior to blood draws or other invasive procedures.  Each ECG reading must 
include the following measurements:  heart rate and QRS, QT, RR,  and PR intervals .  All 
measurements will be recorded on the ECG  electronic case report form  (eCRF ). 
The Investigator or designated site physician will review all ECGs.  Once signed, the original ECG tracing will be retained with the subject’s source documents.  At the request of Tricida , 
a copy of the orig inal ECG will be made available .  Clinically significant ECG 
abnormalities/changes meeting a definition of an AE (see Section 6.11.1) should be recorded 
on the AE eCRF. 
6.9 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
6.9.1 Laboratory Parameters 
The test s listed in Table 2 will be conducted on samples collected and analyzed by standard 
laboratory procedures at the time p oints specified in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 1). 
The bicarbonate test results will be recorded on the eCRF .  Missed test(s) that are not done 
must be reported as such on the eCRFs.  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will 
be recorded on the AE eCRF. 
All blood draws for bicarbonate measurements must be done with subjects in a fasted  state  
(i.e., no food or drink, other than water , for 4 hours). 
Blood bicarbonate assessment using the i- STAT device is mandatory  at each study visi t.  In 
addition, a secondary measurement of blood bicarbonate using either  enzymatic assay or 
benchtop venous blood gas analysis will be conducted  at each study visit at the local 
laboratory. 
Twenty -four-hour urine collections will be done by subjects one day prior to the Baseline 
Visit and on the day prior to the Week 12 visit.  The specimens will be brought to the next 
clinic visit.

6.10 Dietary Counseling  
Dietary counseling will be provided to all study subjects in accordance with dietary 
recommendations for CKD patients (e.g., KDIGO 2013 ) at the time points indicated in the 
Schedule of Events ( see Appendix 1).  In addition, if a subject requires treatment for 
sustained, clinically -significant worsening of metabolic acidosis during the study in the 
judgment of the Investigator, diet counseling (i.e., reduced protein intake, vegetarian/vegan 
protein sources) may be implemented as clinically appropriate and in agreement with the Medical Monitor.  
6.11 Adverse Events  
6.11.1 Definition  of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation  
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal  
relationship with this treatment” ( ICH E2A Guideline: Clinical Safety Data Management: 
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, October 1994).  An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable or unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 47 of 80 (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
This includes:  
• Any new medical  condition, sign or symptom or newly diagnosed event that occurs 
during the AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with an 
underlying condition that were not present prior to the AE reporting period (from the time 
the subject signs the ICF until the completion of the last study visit assessments) ;  
• A previous condition that has worsened in severity or frequency or changed in character during the AE reporting period;  
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions; 
• Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug interaction; and  
• Signs, symptoms or the cli nical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either investigational 
product or a concomitant medication. 
For the purposes of this protocol, events that are not considered AEs include: 
• Isolated decline in blood bicarbonate or blood pH, even if assessed as clin ically 
significant by the Investigator ; 
• Anticipated fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at 
the start of the study unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected 
for the subject’s underlying condition;  
• Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should 
not be reported as AEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example , an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE; 
• Placement of a dialysis access  
- If the access placement was prompted by clinically significant renal function decline 
during the study, then the latter should be reported as an AE and the access placement should be reported as an action taken for the AE. 
• Overdose in the absence of other signs/symptoms will not be reported as an AE in its own right; and  
• Pregnancy ; however, any pregnancy complication should be recorded as an AE. 
Out of range laboratory results and abnormal ECGs, vital signs and other safety assessments 
will be considered AEs if they meet at least one of the following criter ia: 
• Associated  with symptoms or lead to a diagnosis (in such case the symptom or diagnosis 
should be recorded as an AE) ;  
• Lead to discontinuation of study drug; or 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 48 of 80 • The abnormality is deemed  clinically  significant in its own right (i.e., if some action or 
intervention or alteration of treatment is required or if the Investigator judges the change 
to be beyond the range of normal physiological fluctuation). 
6.11.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  (SAE ) is an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life -threatening. (This refers to a subject who, in the view of the Investigator or 
Tricida , was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe).  
• Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, with the 
exception of: 
– Visits to the emergency room or hospital department that do not result in a hospital 
admission  lasting more than 24 hours 
– Elective surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened 
– Routine health assessments requiring admission not associated with any deterioration 
in condition 
– Social admission (lack of housing, family circumstances, etc.) 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in  
death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical  
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above (e.g., blood dyscrasias, convulsions). 
 
Either the Investigator or Tricida  can determine that an AE meets the definition of serious.   If 
either believes that the event is serious, t he event must be considered serious and evaluated 
by Tricida for expedited reporting. 
6.11.3 Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is an AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE.  For the purpose s of Investigational New Drug ( IND) safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.   
All AEs judged by either the Investigator or Tricida as having a reasonable causal 
relati onship to a study drug will be designated as suspected adverse drug reactions.

Confidential   Page 49 of 80 6.11.4 Procedures for Eliciting, Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 
6.11.4.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period 
AEs, including SAEs, will be collected throughout the study period, beginning from the time 
the subject signs the ICF until the subject’s last study visit.  Any AE or SAE that is assessed 
by either the Investigator or Tricida as related to the investigational drug and is ongoing at the last study visit will be followed , whenever possible, until it resolves  or becomes stable or 
the subject is lost to follow -up. 
All subjects who have been exposed to investigational product will be evaluated for AEs.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as those that occur on or after the 
date of the first dose of investigational product.  Non-treatment emergent adverse events 
(e.g., events occurring during Screening) should be recorded as medical history unless related 
to a study procedure, in which case, they should be recorded as adverse events. 
6.11.4.2 Eliciting Adverse Events  
Information on AEs and SAEs will be elicited at each AE assessment time point specified in 
the Schedule of Events (Appendix 1) by asking the subject an open -ended question such as: 
"Since you were last asked, have you felt unwell or different from usual in any way?" The subject may report AEs spontaneously a t any time.   
6.11.4.3 Assessing Adverse Events  
The Investigator should follow the guidelines for rating severity  of adverse events :  
Severity  Definition  
Mild  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; no disruption 
of normal activities; symptoms are transient and would not require 
medication or medical evaluation  
Moderate  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activities and treatment may be required  
Severe  Incapacitating with inability to do work or do usual activities; may require medi cal evaluation and/or treatment; the investigational 
product may have been discontinued  
It is important to note the distinctions between severe AEs and serious AEs.  Severity is a 
classification of  intensity of a specific event, whereas an SAE is an AE  that meets any of the 
regulatory specified criteria required for designation as seriousness described in 
Section  6.11.2 (e. g., a headache may be severe [interferes significantly  with subject's usual 
function] but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs). 
The Investigator will assess relationship  of the AE to the investigational drug, TRC101, 
using the following definitions .  A su spected relationship (related, probably, possibly) 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 50 of 80 between the events and the study drug means, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  If the relationship to the study drug is considered to be unlikely or not related, an alternative suspected etiology should be provided if available (e.g., concomitant medications, intercurrent illness/events). 
Relationship  Definition  Example  
Related  Causal relationship is  
certain  The temporal relationship between  drug exposure 
and the AE onset/course is reasonable, there is a 
clinically compatible response  to de- challenge, 
other causes have been eliminated;  the event must 
be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallenge procedure i f necessary .  
Probable  High degree of certainty  
for causal relationship  The temporal relationship between  drug exposure 
and AE onset/course is reasonable, there is a clinically compatible response to dechallenge (re-challenge is not required), unlikely to be 
attributed to disease or other drugs. 
Possible  Not reasonably related  
although a causal  
relationship cannot be 
ruled out The temporal relationship between  drug exposure 
and the AE onset/course is reasonable or 
unknown, de- challenge information is  either 
unknown or equivocal, could also be explained by disease or other drugs. 
Unlikely  Not reasonably related  
although a causal  
relationship cannot be ruled out Disease o r other drugs provide plausible 
explanation . 
Unrelated  No possible relationship  The temporal relationship between drug exposure  
and the AE onset/course is unreasonable or incompatible, or a causal relationship to study drug is impossible . 
The Investigator will use the following categories to assess the  outcome of each AE:  
• Recovered/reso lved;  
• Not recovered/ not resolved; 
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae;  
• Fatal; or  
• Unknown. 
 
“Fatal ” should be recorded  as an outcome when the AE results in death.  If more than one AE 
is possibly related to the subject's death, the outcome of death should be indicated for the AE 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 51 of 80 that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is the most plausible cause of death.  All other 
ongoing AE/SAEs will be recorded as not recovered/not resolved at the time of death.  
Although “fatal” is usually an outcome of an event , events such as sudden death or 
unexplained death should be reported as SAEs. 
The action taken  with regard to study drug in response to each AE will be assessed by the 
Investigator using the following categories: 
• No action taken; 
• Study drug interrupted; 
• Study drug discontinued; or 
• Not applicable (e.g., subject was not receiving study drug at the time of the AE) . 
 
6.11.4.4 Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
An independent unblinded DMC  will review the safety data during the study conduct .  The 
DMC  Charter will describe the data review process  and its frequency.  
6.11.4.5 Recording Adverse Events 
All AEs and SAEs, whether spontaneously reported by the subject or elicited or noted by 
study staff, will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the appropriate AE eCRF 
page.  In addition, the SAE Report Form must record each SAE.  
All AEs should be recorded using the words of the subject (verbatim term) to describe the 
AE, with two exceptions: if the verbatim term is vague or ambiguous (e.g ., cramps), the 
study staff should try to obtain clarification by asking a follow-up question (e.g., What kind 
of cramps?) and record the words the subject used to clarify the event (e.g., menstrual cramps, calf muscle cramps).  
If the subject reports a gr oup of symptoms and the Investigator is comfortable with a 
unifying diagnosis, the diagnosis should be recorded (e.g., rhinopharyngitis instead of runny nose, cough, sore throat and sneezing).  If a diagnosis is recorded, signs and symptoms need not be rec orded separately.   If the Investigator is unable to report a diagnosis, symptoms 
should be recorded on the AE eCRF. 
The following information should be captured for each AE: date of onset and resolution, 
outcome, severity, seriousness, relationship to the study drug, action taken with the study 
drug and treatments administered.  Any treatment administered as a result of an AE should be recorded on the concomitant medication e CRF .

Confidential   Page 52 of 80 6.11.5 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments 
Clinically si gnificant abnormal laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG abnormalities, and physical 
examination findings before the administration of the first dose of study drug should not be 
reported as AEs, but rather, as medical history, unless they are expected finding s from 
medical history that has already been reported (e.g., elevated phosphate in a patient with a history of hyperparathyroidism).  
Clinically significant new or  clinically significantly worsening a bnormal laboratory findings 
(e.g., serum  chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments (e.g., 
ECGs, vital signs) after the first dose of study drug must be recorded as AEs or SAEs .  
Abnormalities resulting in study drug discontinuation, those associated  with clinical signs or 
symptoms, or requiring treatment should be reported as AEs. 
6.11.6 Serious Adverse Events Reporting   
The Investigator has the obligation to report each SAE to Tricida ’s designee,  
, within 24 hours of knowledge of t he occurrence.  This includes events that 
occur during the Follow-up Period.  Additionally, if the Investigator learns of any SAE that 
occurred after the Follow -up Period for which there is a reasonable possibility of relatedness 
to the investigational dru g, that event must be reported within 24 hours .   
SAEs must be reported by entering the SAE information into the SAE CRF in the electronic data capture ( EDC ) system.   Drug Safety will receive notification of the initial SAE via 
an e- mail alert generated from the EDC system.  
If the event meets seriousness  criteria and it is not possible to access the EDC, SAE reporting 
via a paper form will be required.  Submit SAE information via paper form as described in Figure  3.  The SAE information must be entered onto the SAE e CRF as soon as the EDC 
system becomes accessible.  All SAEs should be followed until they are resolved or stabilized and all rele vant information is compiled.  Follow-up information must be handled 
in the same way and reported within the same time frame as the initial report.  

TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 54 of 80 All AEs will be evaluated on a regular basis by the Medical Monitor to monitor safety in the 
study population. 
6.11.6.1 SAE Expedited Reporting 
For each AE  assessed by either the Investigator or Tricida to be serious, Tricida will 
determine  (1) if the event was unexpected  (i.e., the nature or severity is not expected from the 
information provided in the Investigator's Brochure)  and (2) if the event was a suspected 
adverse reaction.  If the event is determined  to be a serious, unexpected suspected adverse 
reaction  (SUSAR), Tricida will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority and Investigators.  The Investigator is 
responsible for notifying his/her respective IRB/IEC. 
6.11.6.2 Unblinding Treatment Allocation  
Generally, Tricida  should only report  SUSARs for which the treatment allocation of the 
subject is unblinded to the pertinent regulatory authorities.  Investigators should only receive blinded information unless unblinded information is judged necessary for safety reasons . 
When an event may be a SUSAR, the blind should be broken only for that specific subject.  The blind should be maintained for individuals responsible for the ongoing conduct of the study ( e.g., management, monitors and investigators) and thos e responsible for data analysis 
and interpretation of results at the conclusion of the study (e.g., biometrics personnel).  
Unblinded information should only be accessible to those who need to be involved in the 
safety reporting to pertinent regulatory authorities, IECs/IRBs , and the Medical Monitor 
(i.e., the individual performing ongoing safety evaluations during the study). 
6.12 Procedures for Reporting Pregnancy Exposure and Birth Events  
Should a female subject become pregnant or be suspected of being pregna nt while 
participating in this study, the study drug will be permanently discontinued, and the event 
must be reported to Tricida’s designee,  on the Pregnancy 
Notification Form
 within 24 hours  of receipt of information by the study staff.  
The Investigator is also responsible for following up the pregnancy at 3 monthly intervals 
until delive
ry or termination.  Pregnancies should initially be reported in the Pregnancy 
Notification Form and sent by e-mail to the following address:   
When the outcome of the pregnancy is known, study staff will complete the Pregnancy 
Outcome Fo
rm and e- mail it to the following address:  . 
While pregnancy is not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication should be 
r
ecorded as AEs or SAEs (if applicable).  Fatalities, elective or spontaneous abortions, and 
congenital abnormalities/birth defects must be reported as SAEs.

A complete schedule of study events is presented in Appendix 1.  See Table 2 for a 
description of the analytes measured in each laboratory panel.  
7.1 Screening 1 Visit (Week -2) 
The Screening  1 Visit will occur within 2 weeks of the Baseline Visit.  Subjects  should 
present to the clinic in a fasted state (except water) to ensure that they will be fasted for at 
least 4 hours prior to blood draws during the visit.  The following procedures will be performed : 
• Obtain informed consent
 (must be done prior to any of the following procedures 
including asking subjects to discontinue any prohibited medications) 
• Assign a unique subject identification number using the IRT system  
• Evaluate eligibility (inclusion/exclusion criteria)  
• Record demographic data (including sex, age, race, and ethnicity) and medical history  
• Record all prescription and non-prescription medications taken within 28 days  
• Collect vital signs (blood pressure [in triplicate] , heart rate, temperature, and respiratory  
rate [in triplicate] ) 
• Record  body weight and height  
• Draw fasting  blood for the following assessments  at local laboratory :  i-STAT 
bicarbonate, enzymatic serum bicarbonate assay  or venous blood gas bicarbonate assay , 
coagulation (for subjects receiving vitamin K antagonists or factor Xa inhibitors only)  
• Draw fasting  blood for the following assessments at  central laboratory :  serum chemistry  
panel, hematology  panel , hemoglobin A1c, serum pregnancy test (for women of 
childbearing potential only) 
• Obtain urine for spot urine and urinalysis assessments at  central  laboratory  
• Record AEs  
 
7.2 Screening 2 Visit (Week -1) 
Subjects who meet eligibility  criteria b ased on the results of the Screening 1 Visit will return 
for confirmatory bicarbonate and eG FR measurement s at the Screening 2 Visit.  Screening 1 
and Screening 2 Visits must be at least 5 days apart.   
• Evaluate eligibility (blood bicarbonate , eGFR, systolic blood pressure) 
• Record prior medications  
• Collect vital signs (blood pressure [in triplicate] , heart rate, temperature, and respiratory 
rate [in triplicate] ) 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.

• Provide instructions on collecting 24-hour urine sample startin g one day prior to the 
Baseline Visit and dispense necessary supplies   
• Record AEs  
 
7.3 Laboratory Re- Testing and Subject Re-Screening  
The Investigator may repeat a failed Screening blood or urine laboratory assessment once per 
analyte during the Screening Period (including Screening 2 and Baseline Visits) if he/she 
feels the original result was unexpected (e.g., due to a lab error, etc.) .  When Screening 
laboratory values required for study eligibility are repeated, eligibility should be determined 
based on the most recent value. 
If a central laboratory eGFR value from Screening 2 Visit is not available,  eGFR can be 
calculated using CKD -EPI equation based on onsite serum creatinine measurement at the 
Baseline Visit to establish subject’s eligibility .  For eGFR, the most recent creatinine at the 
Screening 1 Visit and the most recent creatinine from Screening 2 Visit should be used.  If a central laboratory eGFR value and a local eGFR value are both available at the time of randomization, the central laboratory value should be used for eligibility determination. 
For blood bicarbonate, the most recent value available from each of the three vis its 
(Screening 1, Screening 2, Day 1) should be used for eligibility determination. Re-screening of subjects who fail to meet eligibility  criteria will be allowed provided the 
Medical Monitor approves, the subject repeats the Informed Consent process and all 
Screening evaluations are repeated; a new subject identification number will be assigned each time a subject is re -screened.  
7.4 Baseline Visit ( Day 1) 
Following completion of the Screening Period, subjects who meet eligibility criteria based on the results of the Screening 1 and 2 Visits will return to the study site for the Baseline Visit on Day 1 (within 2 week s of Screening 1 Visit) for confirmatory blood bicarbonate 
measurement.  Subjects must present to the site in a fasted state.  
The following procedures will be performed:

8 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
8.1 General Considerations  
A statistical analysis plan ( SAP) will provide details of planned analyses and summary 
documents, such as tables, listings, and figures.  This section presents an overview of the 
planned analyses .  Final analyses are not limited to the summaries described herein.   If 
circumstances arise during the stu dy th at make th ese analyse s inappropria te or if  improved 
methods become ava ilable, the S AP m ay be re vised.  The SAP will describe in detail the 
plans for dealing with subjects who drop out of the study. 
Any revisions (both a lternative and additiona l methods) to the SAP, and rea sons for su ch 
revisions, will be des cribed in the fina l study report. 
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by  treatment group (6 g TRC101 or 
placebo) and  time point, as applicable, using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median  and 
appropriate percentiles , standard deviation, minimum, and maximum).  All categorical study 
assessments will be summarized by treatment group and time point, as applicable, using 
frequency counts and percentages.  Two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be reported for 
the efficacy estimates.  
8.2 Determination of Sample Size 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  A sample size of 120 subjects in the TRC101 group and 90 subjects in the placebo group will have high power to detect differences between the TRC101- and placebo -treated groups.  The sample size calculation is based on the data from 
the Phase 1/2 Study TRCA-101, where 3% of placebo and 46% of TRC101 treated subjects 
had an increase in blo od bicarbonate of ≥  4 mEq/L or had blood bicarbonate in the normal 
range at Week 2.  We assume the full TRC101 treatment effect had not been reached during 
this short treatment period.  In Study TRCA-301, we expect that 50 to 55% of TRC101-
treated and 10% of placebo- treated subjects will have an increase of ≥ 4 mEq/L or have 
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 63 of 80 blood bicarbonate in the normal range at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  A Fisher's 
exact test with a 0.05 two -sided significance level will have over 99% power to detect this 
difference when 90 placebo subjects and 120 TRC101 subjects are enrolled.  If the true proportion of TRC101 subjects who respond at the Week 12 Visit is indeed between 50% and 55% and if no more than 5% of subjects have missing data at Week 12, the study wil l 
have roughly 90% power to result in a 95% confidence limit with a lower bound of at least 
35% and 40%, respectively.   
Sample size calculation for the secondary efficacy endpoint will be documented in the SAP. 8.3 Analysis Populations 
Two populations will be analyzed in this study.  The SAP may define additional analysis 
set(s).  
Modified intent -
to-treat (MITT) 
analysis set:  All randomized subjects who had both baseline an d at least one post -
baseline blood bicarbonate value.  Post- baseline is defined as a blood 
bicarbonate  value obtained after the first dose of study drug.  
 
Safety analysis 
set:  
All subjects who received any amount  of study drug (TRC101 or 
placebo)  
 
8.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be listed by treatment group, study site and 
subject, and will be summarized by treatment group .  Frequencies and percentages will be 
presented for the categorical variables and descriptive statistics will be presented for 
continuous variables. 
8.5 Statistical Analysis of Efficacy  
Efficacy data will be summarized by treatment  group  for subjects in the MITT  analysis set 
based on the randomized treatment group assignment .  Number and percentage of subjects, 
along wit h exact (Clopper- Pearson)  95% confidence intervals (CI)  of the percentage,  will be 
provided for all scheduled time points when summarizing categorical efficacy variables.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for all scheduled time points  when summarizing 
continuous efficacy var iables .   
Statistical significance will be declared at the 0.05 level with a  two-sided test.  In order to 
control family -wise error rate, formal statistical testing  for the primary and secondary 
endpoints will be performed sequentially .  At Week 12, Fisher’s exact test will be used to 
compare the group proportions for the primary efficacy endpoint.  O nly when  the primary 
efficacy result  is statistically significant will the formal test be performed using an MMRM 
model to compare the group means at Week 12 for the secondary efficacy endpoint.

Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 64 of 80 8.5.1 Efficacy Variable  
The efficacy analysis will include bicarbonate results  that will be collected at baseline 
through the end of the 12- week treatment  from the i- STAT  device.  The i -STAT bicarbonate 
data will be used to determine the CFB in bicarbonate over time .  Baseline bicarbonate is 
defined as the mean of the bicarbonate values collected at Screening visits  and on Day 1 
pre-dose.  CFB  in bicarbonate will be calculated for each time po int subsequent to the first 
dose of study drug.  Descriptive statistics of efficacy data will be provided for all scheduled 
time points.   
8.5.2 Efficacy Endpoints 
Primary Efficacy:   
Having a CFB in blood bicarbonate ≥ 4 mEq/L or having a  blood bicarbonate in the 
normal range (22 to 29 mEq/L)  at the end of treatment  (Week  12 Visit) .  
Secondary Efficacy:  
CFB  in blood bicarbonate at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit). 
Exploratory Efficacy:  
1. CFB in the total score of the KDQOL Question 3 items (daily activities) at the end of 
treatment (Week 12 Visit). 
2. CFB in repeated  chair stand  test duration at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit). 
 
8.5.3 Efficacy Analysis   
Efficacy data will be summarized by treatment group for subjects in the MITT  analysis set 
based on the randomized treatment group assignment.   
8.5.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis   
The number and proportions (expressed as percentages) of subjects who are responders at 
each time point and at the end of treatment will be calculated.  Responders are defined as 
having a CFB in blood bicarbonate ≥ 4 mEq/L or having a blood bicarbonate in the normal 
range (22 to 29 mEq/L) .  The difference in proportion of responders between TRC101 and 
placebo subjects and its exact (Clopper- Pearson) 95% CI , as well as  the p -value from 
Fisher’s exact test comparing the TRC101 group and the placebo group will be reported by 
time point.   The exact 95% C Is of the proportions will also be summarized by treatment 
group and time point.  A formal test for the difference  (TRC101 – placebo) in proportion (= 
0) will be conducted at Week 12 using the Fisher’s exact test.  If this formal test is 
statistically significant, a second formal test for the proportion of TRC101 responders at 
Week 12 will be conducted.

Confidential   Page 65 of 80 8.5.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The secondary  efficac y analysis will compare the TRC101 group with the placebo group in 
LS mean CFB in blood bicarbonate at the end of treatment (Week 12 Visit).  The null 
hypothesis is that there is no mean difference between the TRC101 group and the placebo 
group.  The alternative hypothesis is that the means differ .  The secondary efficacy  endpoint 
will be assessed using a longitudinal mixed -effect model for repeated measures (MMRM).  
The model will include the CFB in bicarbonate as the dependent variable, treatment, time 
point (Weeks 1, 2, …, 12), and treatment by time point interaction as fixed effects, subject as  
a random effect, the baseline bicarbonate and baseline eGFR  as continuous covariates.  An 
unstructured covariance structure will be assumed.  The least squar es (LS) mean of CFB in 
bicarbonate, standard error of LS mean, and two -sided 95% CIs of the LS mean  from the 
mixed model will be reported by time point and treatment group.  The LS mean difference 
from placebo  (i.e., TRC101 – placebo) , SE of the LS mean di fference, 95% CIs of the LS 
mean difference, and p- values of the LS mean difference from the mixed model will be 
reported by time point.  Only when the primary efficacy endpoint is statistically significant 
will formal testing be performed for the secondar y efficacy endpoint.  Meeting the secondary 
endpoint will be declared if the two -sided p-value at Week 12 is <0.05 and the primary 
efficacy endpoint is statistically significant.   
8.5.3.3 Sensitivity Analyses and Exploratory Efficacy En dpoint Analyses 
In order to evaluate the potential effect of missing data on the primary and secondary efficacy results, sensitivity analyses will be performed using multiple imputation models under a MNAR assumption for the MITT analysis set.  These analyses will be descr ibed in 
the SAP.  
The SAP will also describe the analysis methods for the exploratory efficacy endpoints.   
8.6 Safety Analysis 
Safety will be summarized by treatment group for subjects in the safety analysis set.  The 
number and percentage of subjects with treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) classified by 
system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT); number (%) of subjects experiencing TEAEs by severity, causality, seriousness and action taken with regard to study drug will be summarized by treatment group.  The n umber (%) of subjects with TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study treatment will also be summarized by treatment group.  Subjects will be counted only once at each SOC and PT level of summary.  Clinical laboratory test results, vital signs and ECG findings will be summarized using descriptive statistics by treatment group and time point.  Categorical display methods (e.g., frequencies, shift tables) and plots of laboratory values over time may also be used, as appropriate.  Worsening or n ewly 
observed, clinically significant physical examination findings will be reported as adverse 
events .

Exposure to study drug, dosing compliance, and concomitant medications will be 
summarized by treatment group.  The number and percentage of subjects who used prior and/or concomitant medications will be summarized by Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification levels and treatment group.  At each level of ATC classification, subjects will be counted once.   
9 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING   
9.1 Source Data  
Source documents are original documents, data, and records (e.g., case histories, progress 
notes of the physician, nurses’ notes, medical records, hospital records, clinical and office 
charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, and records kept at the pharmacy or laboratories).  Source data are contained in source documents and must be adequate to reconstruct all data 
transcribed onto the eCRFs and to evaluate the study.  Examples of source data include clinical findings, observations, enrollment summary information and ICF procedures, assessment of clinical significance for laboratory results, AE severity and seriousness, and 
Investigator’s opinion of AE relatedness to TRC101.  
The Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories that 
record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation for all subjects.   
Source documentation should be available at monitoring visits to verify entries made on eCRFs, as needed.  Source documentation should also be available for verification by 
auditors and/or inspectors, as needed . 
9.2 Case Report Forms / Electronic Data Record  
An eCRF is designed to record all of the protocol-required information to be reported to Tricida  on each study subject.  The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, 
completeness, legibility,  and timeliness of the data reported on subjects’ eCRFs.  Data 
reported on the eCRF, which are derived from source documents, should be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies should be explained.  An explanation should be given for all missing data. 
All eCRF data and query resolutions must be completed only by the clinical study personnel 
designated by the Investigator.  All site staff will have proper training prior to accessing the 
EDC system.  
TRC101   Tricida, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: TRCA -301  November 27, 2017 
 
Confidential   Page 67 of 80 Any change or correction to an eCRF will be tracked via an audit trail within the EDC 
system.  The audit trail will contain the original data value, new data value, date changed, the user who made the change, and the reason(s) for the change.  
CRFs should be completed in a timely manner to support the study timeline (i.e., the site 
should not wait for a monitoring visit before entering data into the eCRF). 
Data from the eCRFs and queries will be tracked and entered into a 21 CFR Part 11 
compliant clinical database.  The database system will be a secured, password- protected 
system with full audit trail utility.  
Subject data will be reviewed via programmed quality checks and manually via data listings 
review by Tricida and its designee.  Data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate will be queried for site clarification.  Data corrections will be updated to the database and 
tracked in the audit trail.  AEs and concomitant medications will be coded using industry 
standard di ctionaries (e.g., Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  [MedDR A] and 
World Health Organization [WHO] Drug dictionary). 
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing, verifying, and approving all subject data 
(i.e., eCRFs and resolved queries).  
9.3 Data Handling 
The final data will be transferred to the SAS -system for data analyses in accordance with the 
SAP.   The MedDRA dictionary will be used for coding of AEs and concomitant diseases. 
Concomitant medication will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary ATC c ode. 
9.4 Deviations from the Protocol 
Deviations from the protocol will be judged during the study and/or when an individual subject’s eCRF is completed (monitored).  
The SAP will define major and minor protocol deviations for use in the statistical analysis, if 
applicable.  
9.5 Record Retention  and Archiving  
The Investigator must maintain adequate records for the study including completed CRFs, 
medical records, laboratory reports, signed ICFs , drug disposition records, adverse 
experience reports, information regarding subjects who discontinued, all corresponde nce 
with the IRB/ IEC and Tricida, and other pertinent data.

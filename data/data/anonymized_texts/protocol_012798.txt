 Project overview  
1.1 Summary  
This study is a proof of concept prospective cohort study f ocusing on HIV negative 
women. T he 3 proposed aims will evaluate the effect of depot medroxyprogesterone 
acetate (DMPA), Etonogestrel impant ( Eng-Implant , Nexplanon) and Levonorgestrel 
intrauterine device (Lng IUD, Mirena IUD  or copper IUD) exposure on 1) HIV target 
immune cells within t he female genital mucosa; 2) markers of T -cell activation and 
trafficking within the female genital mucosa; and 3) secreted cytokines and chemokines 
within the female genital mucosa.   A prospectively recruited cohort of HIV negative 
women will allow the ex amination of the overarching hypothesis that alterations in HIV 
target immune cells and function within the female genital mucosa underlie the relatively higher HIV risk associated with the pharmacologic doses of exogenous sex hormones, Because the anticipated mucosal immune changes with progestin -only contraceptives 
are to a large extent mediated via estrogen suppression, the impact of  Nexplanon and 
Mirena IUD  (with milder anti -estrogen effect) is expected to be significantly less 
pronounced compared with that of DMPA. The outcomes of the proposed study could 
have significant clinical implications for the provision of family planning services for women worldwide

 2 Introduction  
2.1 Background  
Interconnected goals of HIV and unintended pregnancy prevention:   Globally, nearly 
16 of the 33 million people living with HIV infection are women, most of whom are of 
childbearing age. (1) Beyond the direct morbidity and mortality of HIV, the majority of these 
women live in regions overwhelmed by high fertility and where the baseline rates of pregnancy associated morbidity and mortality are especially high. Pregnancy prevention can mitigate maternal  morbidity and mortality, decrease unsafe abortion, reduce poverty, 
and improve the educational attainment and status of women. Additionally, for women with HIV, pregnancy prevention can prevent mother -to-child transmission of HIV and resultant 
“AIDS orphans”. Of note, the World Health Organization, United Nations and global public 
health organizations recognize the prevention of new HIV infections and prevention of unintended pregnancy as critical overlapping public health strategies to prevent mother -to-
child transmission, reduce child and maternal mortality and improve health. (2, 3) 
Condoms, while effective to some degree in preventing sexually transmitted infections 
(STIs) including HIV, are not an ideal method of preventing unintended pregnancies when 
used alone. Condom use is associated with a high contraceptive failure rate of ~15% in the first year with typical use. (4) Furthermore, despite three decades of aggressive 
promotion of condom use for the prevention of HIV transmission, consistent use remains inadequate. (5) The most common forms of contraception used worldwide are progestin -
containing hormonal contraceptive methods, either alone or in combination with estrogen, with over 150 million users (6). Hormonal contraceptives have higher pregnancy prevention 
efficacy rates than condoms, with contraceptive failure rate of ~3% following typical DMPA 
 
8 
 use, and <1% following contraceptive implant and intrauterine device use.( 4) Hormonal 
contraceptives have high acceptance rates in many communities around the world where 
condom use may be poor or where non -hormonal contraceptive options, such as the 
copper intrauterine device, are not acceptable or available.  
 Concerns regarding hormonal c ontraception: Despite its excellent contraceptive 
profile, there are growing concerns that contraception hormones, specifically DMPA, may influence susceptibility to HIV and contribute to the spread of HIV infection. (7-9)If 
confirmed, this risk would represent a significant threat to women’s health with far -
reaching implications for public health policy.  Contraceptive approaches that increase the 
risk of HIV acquisition or transmission would have important implications for health at the individual and population levels, as well as on the overall socioeconomic impacts of the AIDS epidemic.  
The significance of this topic is underscored by the ongoing debate it has generated 
among experts in the field and the increasing research focus in this area. The rationale for these intense research activities is anchored by animal data demonstrating several fold increases in the risk of SIV acquisition in rhesus macaques following DMPA exposure, (10) 
and from corroborative human epidemiologic studies.  Notable among these studies is the Mombasa study in Kenya where DMPA use was associated with a 2- fold rise in the 
incidence of HIV infection among 1,500 female sex workers. (8) Another example, from the 
Demographic and Health Surveys of over 4,000 young women from four African countries, reported higher HIV sero- prevalence with DMPA use, with ~6% of new HIV infection 
attributable to DMPA. (11) Summarized in Table 2 are the outcomes of recent studies that 
 
9 
 have evaluated the impact of DMPA on HIV acquisition risk among women.  
It should be noted that the HIV risk of contraceptive hormones has not been 
consistently observed across all studies. Some studies have completely failed to show this 
association( 12-15) and others report an increased risk of HIV infection only in a subgroup 
of individuals with differences such as age or HSV -2 status. (16-19) The wide 
discrepancies in study design, subjects’ selection, sample sizes, contraceptive type, method discontinuation, dose, and method of administration also adds to the complexity of interpreting the results across these studies and limit conclusions that can be drawn from the existing data. To our knowledge no well -designed studies have evaluated the impact of 
progestin releasing implants or IUDs on the risk of HIV -infection.  While these data are far 
from conclusive, they are nevertheless worrisome, and provide a strong impetus to further assess the potential risk of HIV acquisition among existing hormonal contraceptive methods.

Potential mechanisms of increased HIV acquisition risk with hormonal contraception :  How might pharmacologic doses of sex hormones alter the risk of HIV 
transmission in women? It is understood that the male to female sexual transmission of HIV 
infection is a multifaceted process of virus -host interactions ( Figure 1 ). Simply, following exposure, 
initial infection occurs at the genital mucosa and may involve complex interactions betw een a 
number of HIV target immune cells – CCR5 expressing CD4
+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic 
cells (DCs) including myeloid DCs and Langerhans cells (LCs). (25-28) It is thought that CD4+ 
lymphocytes are the first cells to be infected, and that DCs subsequently spread the virus to 
regional lymph nodes. (29) DCs may further facilitate the transmission process through mucosal 
antigen processing necessary for activation of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, a step that is important for continuing propagation of the infection, as activated CD4+ T c ells are more likely to 
be infected and to support viral replication in vivo. (30)   
 
11 
 Viruses recovered during primary HIV infection 
almost always are of the non -syncytium -inducing, 
R5-tropic phenotype, presumably due to the 
abundance of the viral entry co -receptors, CCR5, on 
cells of the mucosal  
surface and/or because of R5 expressing cells' 
capacity to support viral replication and propagation of the infection. (31) In addition to the disease state 
and local viral load of the donor, factors that increase susceptibility to HIV infection and infectivity include 
STIs, mucosal micro -abrasions, secreted immune factors – all of which affect the local immune 
status, the protective quality of the epithelial barrier in the genital tract, and the population of HIV target cells involved in the early stages of infe ction (32). Natural resistance to HIV acquisition has 
been ascribed to a variety of factors including genetically acquired resistance (e.g., CCR5 receptor deletions), the presence of host proteins such as secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor  (SLPI), 
normal vaginal flora with peroxide -producing lactobacilli (void of bacterial vaginosis), and acquired 
immunity mediated by vaginal secretory IgA or cytotoxic T- lymphocyte (CTL)  
responses in blood.

 women is the emerging evidence that the robustness and functional capacity of the innate and 
adaptive immune responses are influenced by female sex hormones. (33-35) The immuno -
regulatory influence of estradiol and progesterone ensures a favorable environment for fertilization and pregnancy altering the local female genital tract (FGT) immunologic milieu and the composition of key HIV target immune cells.  For exampl e, systemic and topical administration of 
estrogen thickens the vaginal epithelial layer in ovariectomized rhesus macaques as illustrated in Figure 2A. (35-37) By increasing the thickness of the vaginal mucosal epithelium, estrogen blocks 
access of SIV and other pathogens to target cells (DC s/LCs, CD4
+ T cells, and macrophages) within 
the epithelial and sub- epithelial layers. Furthermore, estrogen reduces the population of LCs 
within the vaginal epithelium, alters vaginal epithelial tight junctions and mucosal permeability (38, 
39) and supports healthy genital tract flora making the mucosa hostile and less susceptible to the 
virus. (40)  
Contrary to the effect of estrogen, progesterone exposure leads to a thinner epithelial layer in 
female macaques allowing easier access of SIV to LCs and other target cells ( Figure 2B ). These 
results in non- human primates have not consistently been shown to occur in humans thus 
alternative mechanisms deserve further exploration in light of the purported HIV risk of hormonal contraception. Emerging data suggest that progesterone treatment increases the population of LCs within the epithelial layer and induces changes in the  vaginal microbiota, such as reduction in 
colonization with lactobacilli , increasing the predisposition to bacterial vaginosis. ( 41) Divergence 
from the healthy vaginal flora has been associated with increased HIV acquisition risk (42, 43). 
Furthermore, progestin contraceptives are associated with increased incidence cervical candidiasis 
 
13 
 and of STIs such as gonorrhea and chlamydia (35) – factors that may enhance the risk of HIV 
acquisition. (44) It is unclear if these changes stem from direct biological effects of contraceptive 
exposure or behavioral  changes, such as reduced condom use.  
Other actions of progesterone pertinent to HIV acquisition risk include suppression of IgG and 
IgA production and trans -epithelial transport within the FGT, (45-47) inhibition of CTL responses 
and blockade of T cell perforin expression. (48, 49) Progesterone alters the expression of cytokines, 
favoring Th2 -type over Th1- type responses. (50) Progesterone significantly alters infiltration of 
genital tissue with natural killer (NK) cells , lymphocytes, and macrophages, and inhibits NK cell 
activity and Fc -gamma receptors  (FcγR) expression on monocytes, thus reducing the functional 
capacity of the antibody -dependent cell cytotoxicity. (51-53) The progestin contraceptive DMPA 
inhibits Toll -like receptor -9-induced interferon alpha (IFN) -α production by plasmacytoid DCs 
thereby impairing IFN -α induced antiviral state and the innate antiviral immunity. (54) Lastly, 
studies have indicated that expression/secretion of chemokines, cytokines and endogenous 
antimicrobials in FGT sec retions alter over the course of the menstrual cycle, suggesting a role for 
hormones in regulating their release (55, 56). For example, studies have demonstrated significant 
luteal phase suppression of SLPI, HBD2, HNP1 -3 and lactoferrin from FGT reduced SLPI secretion in 
postmenopausal compared to premenopausal women( 57, 58) and reduced endometrial 
expression of SLPI among women using DMPA (59). 
Taken together, these actions of progesterone may compromise the integrity of the protective 
epithelial layers a gainst HIV infection, promote enhanced homing and thus the availability of HIV 
susceptible cells within the FGT, and dampen the robustness of the local innate antiviral and the 
 
14 
 adaptive secretory immune responses. As hormonal contraception can alter endogenous hormone 
levels and have direct impact on the FGT, well -designed studies are needed to evaluate for changes 
in these factors that influence HIV susceptibility following different hormonal contraceptive exposures.   
 
Different progestin-containing contraceptives and 
the potential risk of 
HIV acquisition:  
Hormonal contraceptives employ different strategies to prevent pregnancy, including ovulation inhibition, altered endometrial structure and thickening of the cervical mucus barrier. Common progestin- containing contraceptives currently 
available in the United States differ by the type of progestin they contain, mode of delivery, typical -use efficacy, duration of effectiveness, and degree of endogenous hormone and ovulation Table 3: Comparative properties of t hree progestin -only

 inhibition (60) ( Table 3). Each progestin thus has variable degrees of estrogenic, androgenic, anti -
andogenic, glucocorticoid and anti -mineralocorticoid activity (61, 62). Medroxyprogesterone 
(MPA), for example, has androgenic activity, no anti -mineralicorticoid activity and potent 
glucocorticoid activity, higher than any other progestin or endogenous progesterone.  
Different formulations of injectable contraceptives are currently licensed for use. Due to its lower 
cost and availability, DMPA , at a dose of 150 mg given intramuscularly (IM) every 3 months, is 
widely used globally. One factor limiting contraceptive effectiveness is poor adherence to the scheduled repeat injections. Thus, efforts have been made to promote longer -term contraceptive 
options, such as contraceptive implants and IUDs. The contraceptive implant prototype, Norplant was introduced in 1984, (
63) and since then, over 10.5 million implants have been distributed 
worldwide. A major difference between the injectable contraceptives and the implants is in the kinetics of systemic progestin release. This difference leads to varying degrees of hypothalamic -
pituitary -ovarian (HPO) axis modulation resultin g in differential suppression of estrogen among 
the different progestin- only contraceptive formulations. ( 62) DMPA plasma concentrations, fo r 
example, quickly increase after intramuscular injection, peak within the first month followed by a plateau of serum MPA concentrations at 1.0 -1.5ng/mL for about 3 months, after which blood 
concentrations decline slowly. Endogenous estradiol and progesterone levels are suppressed for several months after DMPA injection corresponding to suppression of ovulation. (64)  The 
Etonogestrel Implant  (Nexplanon) , on the other hand,  is a single sterile rod implant inserted sub -
dermally. Each implant rod contains 68 mg of the synthetic progestin, etonogestrel (ENG). After a peak of 813 pg/ml at about day 4 following insertion, concentrations reach steady state (200 
 
16 
 pg/ml) at about 4 – 6 months and remain sufficient to prevent pregnancy for 3 years. Although it 
initially suppresses follicular development and estradiol production, ovarian activity slowly 
increases after 6 months, and follicle stimulating hor mone and estradiol levels are almost normal 
thus serum estrogen concentrations are significantly higher compared to that observed with DMPA use. (65
)   The  levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine device ( Mirena IUD ) has a steady state 
plasma lev onorgestrel concentration of 150- 200 pg/mL that is reached in the first few weeks after 
placement of the IUD with levels maintained for up to 5 years after insertion. There is no change in serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations in Mirena IUD  users  compared to non- users; 
women with Mirena IUD s continue to have normal ovulatory function (
66). There is a gradual 
reduction in endometrial thickness with the Mir ena IUD  with an associated gradual reduction in 
blood flow to spiral -arteries to the endometrium and menstrual blood flow.  
 
Although systemic levels of Lng  are low, it is unknown how the high concentrations localized to 
the FGT may impact local immune function. Given the salutary effect of estrogen on the FGT, we 
speculate that Mirena IUD  and  Nexplanon , due to reduced suppression of endogenous estrogen 
com pared with DMPA, will have lower impact on mucosal immune function and therefore be less 
likely to increase HIV acquisition risk. The copper IUD  is a non -hormonal method that provides 
effective contraception up to 12 years. Although the copper IUD does not n impact the normal 
hormonal mileau, different changes in the local immune environment are potential and may 
impact infection risk.  
2.2 Significance of p roposed study  
This research is significant in that it will:  
 
17 
 • It will test novel hypotheses related to se x hormone -induced homing of HIV target immune 
cells to the genital mucosal to explain the purported increased HIV acquisition risk of 
progestin -only contraceptives.    
• It will generate novel data on the potential contributions of one non -hormonal IUD (copper) 
and 3 different progestin- only contraceptives (DMPA ), Nexplanon  and Mirena IUD  on 
immunologic parameters that may increase the risk of HIV acquisition among at -risk women.  
• It will employ the collection of  cervicovaginal lavage (CVL)cervical biopsies , vaginal biops ies 
and two  endocervical cytobrush  sample s to provide cellular marker s representative of a 
susceptible population of cells from the lower FGT, free from circulatory contamination.  
 
3.0 Study Objectives  and Hypotheses  
3.1 Research hypotheses and o bjectives  
This research  will evaluate the impact of one non -hormonal IUD and 3 different progestin- only 
contraceptive methods: 1) DMPA, 2) an Etonogestrel impant ( Nexplanon), 3) the Levonorgestrel 
Intrauterine Device ( Mirena IUD ), and 4) Copper IUD,  on known factors in the FGT that can modify 
HIV acquisition risk, including changes in the distribution and activation of HIV susceptible T -cells 
and mucosal chemokines and cytokines. One hundred and twenty (120)  HIV-negative  women 
seeking family planning will be recruited into a prospective study evaluating vaginal mucosal immunologic markers of HIV susceptibility before and after contraceptive initiation.  
It is unclear how different progestin analogues and varying systemic and FGT hormonal concentrations associated with their different contraceptive delivery and pharmacokinetics may influence FGT immune function. Because many of the anticipated mucosal immune changes with 
 
18 
 progestin -only contraceptives are mediated via estrogen suppression, we hypothesize that the 
impact of Nexplanon  and Mirena IUD  (milder anti -estrogen effect) will be significantly less 
pronounced compared with that of DMPA – a finding that would have significant clinical 
implications for family planning for women at risk for HIV.  
Aim 1:  To evaluate the effects o f DMPA,  Nexplanon  and two IUDs ( Mirena and copper)  on the  
exposure on the frequency of HIV target immune cells within the female genital mucosa of HIV 
negative women.  Hypothesis : Compared to a no contraception baseline, there will be an increase in HIV  target CD4+ 
T cells in the female genital mucosa following initiation of hormonal contraception and these 
effects will be greater with DMPA because of its more pronounced anti -estrogen action relative to 
Nexplanon and Mirena IUD .   
Aim 2: To evaluate the effects of DMPA, Nexplanon and two IUDs ( Mirena and copper)  on the  
exposure on markers of T cell activation and trafficking in the female genital mucosa of HIV negative women desiring hormonal contraception.  
Hypothesis : Compared to a no contraception baseline, there will be an increase in T cell activation 
and trafficking following hormonal contraception and these effects will be greater with DMPA because of its more pronounced anti -estrogen action relative to Nexplanon and Mirena IUD .  
Aim 3: To evaluate the effects of DMPA, Nexplanon and two IUDs ( Mirena and copper)  on 
cytokines and chemokine profiles within the female genital mucosa.  
Hypothesis : Compared to a no contraception baseline, there will be an increase in 
proinflammatory and chemotaxic cytokines and chemokines, and a decrease in anti -inflammatory 
 
19 
 and inhibitory  cytokines and chemokines following initiation of hormonal contraceptive use and 
these effects will be greater with DMPA because of its more pronounced anti -estrogen action 
relative to Nexplanon and Mirena IUD . 
 
Overall, this evaluation of the immunologic correlates associated with HIV susceptibility following exposure to different progestin- only contraceptives will explore the relative impact of these 
contraceptives on HIV risk. This work will contribute to the g rowing literature on hormonal 
contraception and HIV acquisition risk, establish critical baseline data needed to explore the safety 
of hormonal contraception in high- risk women, and set the foundation for the candidate to 
evaluate the impact of exogenous hormonal exposure on mucosal immunology and reproductive 
infectious disease in future research.  
4 Study Design  
 
Overview and study design: To explore plausible mechanisms for the link between HIV acquisition 
risk and hormonal contraceptives, the research component of this proposal will examine changes in the FGT following exposure to three progestin only contraceptives, DMPA,  Nexplanon , and 
Mirena IUD  and the non hormonal copper IUD, in women who are seeking contraception .The 
research design allows the exploration of multiple aims concurrently  (Figure 3) .

healthy reproductive -aged women from across the state of Georgia seek family planning annually. 
Additionally, recruitment will take place at Emory Clinic Gynecology and Obstetrics practi ce and at 
the IDP/Ponce Clinic . Women who present for  a family planning visit and who are interested in 
one of the 4 contraceptives under study will be approached for participation by study staff not 
involved with the individuals clinical care.  Clinicians will alert the research staff of potential 
participants and the research staff will approach the potential participant. Research staff will  read 
a standard recruitment script (A ppendix A ).  
If interested , staff will complete a screening checklist to see if the  individual is eligible for 
participation  (Appendix A)  

 
21 
  2) By self -referral: Individuals will contact study staff in response to a flyer . Flyer s will be placed 
throughout the Atlanta community including but not limited to Grady Memorial hospital 
gynecology clinic, Emory Campus and Clinics. Women who contact study staff will complete a screening checklist to see if the individual is eligible for participation (Appendix A), and if interested they may be scheduled for a screening visit   
 Recruitment will continue until 30 individuals are enrolled into each contraceptive arm ( 120 total).  
We anticipate recruiting at the rate of ~30 participants per year and should complete accrual by 
year 3, all study visits should be completed by year 4. Although a randomized controlled study 
design ensures balance between arms, for feasibility reasons and because contraceptive choice in our population is a personal decision, the specific contraceptive type will be left to the preference of participants.  
4.1.2. Screening for eligibility  will include a complete history and physical examination, pelvic 
examination and point of care urine sampling for pregnancy test. In addition.   The HIV test will be 
a point of care/rapid test using OraQuick® , an FDA -approved oral swab in- home test for HI V-1 and 
HIV-2. This is an oral swab test that doesn't require blood.  Notably, screening visit may occur at 
the same time as visit one.  Notably to avoid any false positives all screen , positive tests with the 
OraQuick®  will be sent to a clinical lab for confirmatory HIV testing. Similarly, to pre vent any false 
negatives, all women who screen negative and enroll in the study, will have HIV serum testing as part of their enrollment laboratory evaluation. Any positive test in t he research lab , will trigger a 
clinical evaluation with confirmatory testing in a clinical labortatory and evaluation.  
 
22 
 4.1.3 Eligibility  
Participants who meet all of the following inclusion criteria  will be eligible for the study (a) 
female (b) age 18 -45 years, (c) normal menses (22 -35 day intervals) for at least 3 cycles, (d) intact 
uterus and cervix, (e) interested in DMPA, Nexplanon,  Mirena IUD , or Copper IUD  (f) willing to 
delay initiation of hormonal contraception for up to 1 month to complete pre -contraceptive study 
visits , (g) willing to use condoms or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least 24 hours before 
each genital tract sampling (condoms will be made available), (h) able and willing to provide 
informed consent, and undergo serial blood and vaginal sampling, (i) negative HIV screening. 
Participants who meet any of the following exclusion criteria  will not be eligible for the study: (a) 
pregnant within the last 3 months (b) breastfeeding, (c) history of loop electrosurgica l excision 
procedure, conization, or cryosurgery within the past year, (d) use of hormonal contraception or IUD in the past 6 months or, (e) known history of medical condition that would interfere with the conduct of the study, (f) symptomatic vaginal infe ction or genital ulcer disease at screening, (g) 
taking medications that interact with selected contraceptive, and (h) contraindications to selected contraceptive per the CDC medical eligibility criteria (67) or judgment of clinician. For the copper 
IUD, exclusion criteria: allergy to copper. Participant s who agree to the cervical and vaginal biopsy 
will have the addition exclusion criteria: allergy to lidocaine . 
The cost of their selected contraceptive will be covered by  research study funds .  They will be 
informed of this during the consenting process.  
 
 
23 
 4.1.4 Consent  
Voluntary, informed written consent for participation will be administered prior to 
initiation  of study activities  (See Consen t Forms in Appendix B). The consent form will describe the 
purpose of the study, the study participants’ role in the study, the risks and benefits of the study, 
the duration of participation, the study procedures, contact persons for questions about the study (including the chair of the Institutional Review Board at Emory University and Grady Memorial Hospital), the voluntary nature of participation, and the right to decline specific questions or procedures or withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. An explanation will be 
provided about the use of protected health information (PHI) for research purposes and how 
confidentiality will be maintained as far as possible under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA). Study participants will be asked to sign an authorization form for the use of PHI prior to enrollment in the study and will receive a copy for their records  (Appendix B). 
Under no circumstances will the study participants be permitted to enroll in the study without their signed consent . All signed forms will be kept in a locked cabinet at all times.   
4.1.5 Study completion  
 Study will be complete when 120  women, 30 i n each contraceptive arm, complete the 
screening and the  study visits . As this is a longitudinal study, we may have some loss to follow -up, 
and the study may be considered complete after three unanswered attempts to contact missing participants have been made. There is minimal risk, so we do not anticipate any study related adverse events or complications related to study activities that would require specific stopping rules and interim analyses.  
4.1.6 Study visit schedule  
 
Upon successful screening, participants will be scheduled for study visit 1 three weeks 
 
24 
 following the onset of their menses (luteal phase for women who cycle every 22 -35 days). 
Participants will be instructed to refrain from vaginal intercourse or using intra -vaginal products 
for 24 hours before FGT sampling. This and subsequent study visits will occur according to the 
schedule outlined in Figure 3  and Table 4.  At each visit, an interval assessment of menstruation 
and hormonal contraception use will be collected and used to determine the phase of the 
menstrual cycle. If a participant is experiencing menstrual bleeding during a follow -up visit, 
evaluations will be deferred for 1 week.  On the day preceding a study visit, participants will be asked to  abstain from vaginal intercourse to 
minimize the risk of contamination of genital tract samples by semen.

*** Blood for HIV target inflammatory/immune cells, E2 and P4  
 
4.2 Study visits  
A brief questionnaire to assess sexual behavior and bleeding or vaginal symptoms will be asked, 
urine will be collected for a pregnancy test, a pelvic exam will be performed with measurement of  
vaginal pH  using a PH meter , a swab will be collected for a wet -mount, a swab for multiplex PCR of 
vaginal fluid , a swab for vaginal microbiome,  a CVL collection (for immunological testing and 
prostatic specific antigen (PSA)), a swab for gut microbiome,  and blood (for immunological testing 
and hormonal concentrations). At visit 1, additional blood will be collected for HSV serology , HIV  
and RPR.  At visit 2 and visit 4, a cervical or vaginal biopsy will be performed for a subset of 
participants  that consent (10 per contraceptive arm)  so that one or more samples of tissue from 
the cervix  or vagina are acquired for evaluating  HIV susceptibility and inflamation markers.  
At visits 1 -4, two  endocervical cytobrush sample s of genital specimens will be collected for immune 
phenotyping.  
 
Hormonal contraceptives  Participants will be given the option to choose between DMPA, 
Nexplanon, copper IUD  and Mirena IUD . DMPA will be dispensed from the Grady Pharmacy 
Service and will be administered every 12 weeks at the standard dose of 150 mg IM, beginning from week 3 of study enrollment and repeated at week 15.  A standard Nexplanon rod Implan t or 
the IUD ( Mirena  or copper)   will be placed at study week 3 by Dr. Haddad or a trained clinician. 
 
26 
 The cost of study contraceptives will  be covered by this study . 
Of note, study visits are scheduled to ensure that the collection of pre -contraceptive sam ples 
occur at both the luteal (week 1 visit) and the follicular (week 3 visit) phases of the menstrual 
cycle. Serum hormone levels will confirm cycle phase. Post -contraceptive samplings are 
strategically delayed to avoid sampling during the initial (first 3 months) phase when irregular bleeding associated use may occur. Furthermore, the proposed sampling schedule will allow us to capture data at the trough (week 15) and peak (week 17) of the concentration- time -curve for 
DMPA. If bleeding at the time of a scheduled visit, the visit will be postponed to occur within one 
week or at a subsequent point corresponding to their intended cycle phase (luteal/follicular) or drug exposure (DMPA peak or trough) of the missed visit. Because the study requires intensive and invasive sample collection, concerted efforts will be made to enhance retention and study 
completion .  
4.3.1 Disenrollment  
A study participant may elect to discontinue participation in the study at any time  without 
disruptionof  their clinical care .   If during follow -up, any laboratory testing indicates the presence 
of an infection, participants will be  referred clinical  clinical providers for further evaluation. If 
pregnant  or if the protocol chair  thinks it is in the woman’s best interest , she will no longer be 
followed  by the study . The study may be discontinued at  any time by  a participating  IRB, the Office 
for Human Research Protections , or other government age ncy as part of their duties to ensure 
that research subjects are protected.  
 
 
27 
 4.3.2 Participant referral  
 If a participant is diagnosed with any clinical issues during the course of study participation, 
they will be referred to a clinician or the health department to receive further testing and/or 
clinical care. Specifically, this refers to anyone diagnosed with any infection, pregnancy, or contraceptive issue. Clinical followup within 1 week will be encouraged for all participants and a written record relating to the clinical issue (test results, clinical finding or impression) will be provided to the participant.. Should they have a specific provider, it will be recommended that the y 
contact that provider for an appointment. If the individual does not have a provider , we will 
facilitate getting the participant into care at the Grady Title X clinic or the ir health department  for 
evaluation and/or treament. We will follow -up with the participant within one week to confirm 
that they have sought appropriate care and if care has not been received, we will reinforce with the participant the importance of seeking treatment and actively assist in getting the participant into care.  
5 Data and Biological Specimen Collection  
 
Participants enroll ed will undergo an interview, blood draw, and gynecologic exam with 
specimen collection at four study visits  spanning 14 weeks .   
5.1 Clinical evaluation  
The clinical evaluation and all specimen collection s will be performed by a study clinician or 
the trained study nurse using standard operating procedures determined prior to study initiation. 
All exam results will be documented on the biologic study clini cal exam form (Appendix C). At the 
first visit, a urine HCG pregnancy test will be performed to document study eligibility  after the 
consent form has been signed. Additionally a point -of-care HIV test will be administed  to confirm 
 
28 
 HIV negative status at baseline. At all visits, a pelvic exam will be performed. The clinician will 
examine for  genital lesion s and purulent vaginal discharge, and any abnormalities in the 
cervicovaginal mucosa will be documented on the physica l exam data collection form. Wet-prep 
evaluations will be performed for bacterial vaginosis, yeast, and trichomoniasis during each pelvic 
exam. If during the course of study participation, any laboratory testing indicates the presence of 
infection, or if the participant’s symptoms or physical examination raise suspicion of any other genital infection, a study clinician will refer for further care. There will be no extra information related to treatment or treatment outcomes recorded for study participants be yond what is 
standard of care . If during follow -up a woman is determined to be pregnant, she will be referred 
for care and no longer followed.  
During the pelvic exam, vaginal pH will be measured  with a pH meter , a vaginal swab will be 
collected for evaluation of vaginal microbiome , a swab for a multiplex PCR, a swab will be 
collected for a wet Prep , cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) will be collected by cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) 
for inflammatory marker quantification  and two  endocervical cytobrush sample s of genital 
specimens for immune phenotyping .  A swab will be collected into the anal opening to evaluate 
the gut microbiome.  To enhance cellular yield  from the posterior fornix of the FGT , CVL will be 
performed using 10 cc of phosphate buffered saline ( PBS). Lavage  will be  repeated with a second 
aliquot of 10 cc of PBS. . Previous experience with this approach yielded 0.2 -1X10
6 leukocytes per 
10 cc of CVL, an amount of cells adequate for the proposed study endpoints and importantly avoided the need for the more invasive cervical cytobrush or vaginal biopsy sampling that also risks blood contamination of the sample. A second 10 cc of PBS will be collected in a similar 
 
29 
 fashion to increase the potential yield for analysis. Obtained PBMC and CVL leuko cytes will be 
processed and analyzed in real time for flow cytometry based phenotypic analysis. Additional CVL, 
vaginal swab, anal swab  and plasma samples will be aliquoted and cryopreserved or frozen at -
80oC until analyzed for other endpoints. Dr. Haddad or a trained study nurse will perform all 
exams and sampling.  Also at visit 2 and visit 4, a cervical or vaginal biopsy will be performed for a 
subset of participants that consent (10 per contraceptive arm)  so that one or more samples of 
tissue from the vulva or vagina are acquired for evaluating   HIV susceptibility and inflamation 
markers  in the future.  
In addition to the pelvic evaluation, blood will be collected at each visit in  two 8 mL -
vacutainer tube s (2 Cell Preparation Tubes ( CPT)) for immunologic markers,  and hormonal 
assessment  (E2/P4 levels)  at all four visits . Additional blood (1 Plasma Preparation Tube ( PPT) will 
be collected at visit one  for syphilis with rapid plasma re agin (RPR), HIV and HSV serology  at the 
research lab . Table 4 lists the schedule of events and biologic specimen collection  for the study.  
The collection of specimens at each visit will be noted on the specimen collection form (Appendix D). Positive test  results from the research lab can not be relied upon for patient care. Any positive  
test results concerning for infection from the research lab will trigger further clinical investigation 
with referral for further testing  and treatment .   
5.2 Laboratory testing  
 
All laboratory results  from assays on blood  or vaginal swab s, and CVL will be documented 
on the laboratory results forms (Appendix E ). 
 
30 
 Specimens  collected will be transported within 4 hours the  lab. Blood will will be separated 
and immediately processed for immunophenotyping and immune cell -activation assays, as 
described below for the vaginal samples. The separated plasma will be aliquoted and stored at -
80oC until batch testing commences, as described below for th e vaginal samples . Progesterone 
(P4) and estrogen (E2) levels will be measured in plasma using the Milliplex kit for Luminex Assay 
(EMD Millipore, Billarica, MA) .  
A vaginal swab and anal swab will be collected and stored for future microbiome 
characteriza tion via next -generation sequencing using the Ion Torrent platform to sequence 16S 
rDNA from bacterial species present in the vaginal compartment.  
The CVL specimens will be tested for blood and leukocyte levels with a urine dipstick  test 
and prostate specific antigen (PSA), a marker of semen exposure, using the Abacus ABAcard p30 test.  The sample will be centrifuged, and the  cell pellet will be re -suspended in cell culture media , 
and the leukocytes will be isolated from epithelial cells using Percoll gradient centrifugation.  The resuspended CVL cell pellet  (and PBMC pellet, separately) will be split for analysis. One half of the  
sample will be used for immune cell characterizati on (i.e., T cell subsets, HIV co -receptor 
expression) by  antibody staining and multi -color flow cytometry  using a LSR -2 platform. The other Table 5: Summary of Covariates and Analytic Methods for All Specific Aims

 half of the sample will be used to assess functional attributes of the T -cells . Cells will be stimulated 
with PMA an d ionomycin (a polyclonal activator) in a tissue culture dish for 5 hours in the 
presence of brefeldin A and monensin and analyzed for the production of selected cytokines and 
chemokines by flow cytometry. Multicolor flow cytometry  will be performed on matched PBMC 
and CVL samples utilizing the LSR -II platform (BD Biosciences) as previously described. (68) For 
assessment of HIV target cells, samples will be stained with a Live/Dead viability dye and fluorochrome labeled antibodies a gainst  CD3, CD4, CD27, CD45RA, CCR5 and CXCR4. Effector 
memory (CD45RA -/CD27 -) CD3+CD4+ cells will be analyzed for surface expression of HIV co -
receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 and reported as percent of total leukocytes and total CD4+ T cells.  
We will examine a p anel of proinflammatory, anti -inflammatory, inhibitory and chemotaxic 
cytokines and chemokines, focusing our analysis on those previously reported to influence recruitment of HIV target cells to the FRT such as IL1 and IP10 (69). Using multiplex Luminex® 
assays  combined with a customized multi -analytical panel of 22 human cytokines and chemokines, 
we will quantify concentrations of cytokines and chemokines in plasma and CVL supernatant at each study visit from participants enrolled  
Recent s emen exposure will be measured with a qualitative PSA ABAcard® p30 test 
(Abacus Diagnostics)  (70). The wet -mount will be evaluated using saline and 10% KOH for 
evaluation of budding yeast or hyphae.  A gram stain will be performed for Nugent scoring  (71) to 
diagnose BV. A multiplex PCR assay, able to screen for multiple STIs concurrently without the need for multiple samples to be collected, will be used to evaluate for STIs including N. gonorrhea, C. trachomatis, T. vaginalis, M. genitalium, T. pallidu m, and HSV -1/HSV -2. Serological tests for HIV 
 
32 
 and HSV will be performed via enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using a Vitros® 3600 Immunodiagnostic 
system (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics) and syphilis screening determined via a commercially available rapid plasma reagi n (RPR) kit.  Positive test results from the research lab can not be relied upon for 
patient care. Any positive test results concerning for infection from the research lab will trigger further clinical investigation with referral for further testing performed by a CLIA -approved 
laboratory and treatment.   Table 6.  Biological specimens and laboratory methods

5.3 Specimen management and s torage  
As the transmission of HIV and other blood- borne pathogens can occur through contact 
with contaminated needles, blood, and blood products, appropriate blood and secretion 
precautions will be employed by all personnel in the drawing of blood and handling of all 
specimens for this study, as currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All infectious specimens will be transported using packaging mandated in the Code of Federal Regulations, 42 CFR Part 72. Specimens , inclusive of the  cervical or vagina l biopsies that 
are not used immediately will be processed and stored at CDC  for future testing.  Plasma and 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be stored at -70°C. Vaginal swabs, Anal swab  and 
CVL supernatants will be stored at -70°C. Specimens collected will  be used for  the evaluation s 
described within this protocol. Any remaining specimens will be stored for potential future use only if the patient has consent ed to storage of specimens. These specimens may be used in the 
future to further evaluate HIV, immunologic  microbiologic factors of interest  or as a source of 
DNA for future genetic analysis . A subject may request that any stored specimens are destroyed 
prior to completion of the study. Specimens will be stored with the study ID of participant only , 
and no patient identifiable information. At study completion any identifiers t hat link the subject to 
the study ID  will be destroyed. Specimen s torage will be fo r an indefinite amount of time  if 
consent for storage had been signed. During the consent process, specimen storage will be 
discussed and participants will be consented to allow for storage and future testing of specimens . 
 
34 
   
 
35 
 5.4 Specimen collection considerations  
Swabs  and cervicovaginal lavage collections are minimal risk  procedures . Specimens 
contaminated with blood may need to be excluded from our analyses. Every effort will be taken to 
reduce such risks by starting with the least invasive collections (swabs and tear -flo strips), then 
proceed with cervicovaginal lavage collection which introduces specimen dilution. We do not anticipate that collecting multiple samples in this order will influence any of the subsequent data collectio n endpoints, given the large vaginal surface. By maintaining a consistent order of 
specimens collected at each visit we will minimize experimental variability.  
6 Ethics  and Risks  
The s tudy will not commence until the study protocol has been reviewed and approved by 
the Emory University institutional review board (IRB)  and the Grady Health System Research 
Oversight Committee . 
6.1 Potential risks 
The risks involved in study participation are those related to providing personal 
information about sensitive topics such as sex, contraception, antiretroviral medication use, and pregnancy.  Participants’ privacy and the confidentiality of data will be prote cted 
through training of interviewers and other study staff, conducting all interviewing and 
physical examinations in private , storing study materials in a locked room , and securing 
computer files that include identifiers. Only the study identification num ber will identify 
participant research records. Linkages between the ID number  and participants’ identifying 
information will be maintained in a computer database that is password protected and only accessible to study staff. These linkages will be destroyed after completion of study activities . Breaches of confidentiality are possible, though safeguards are in place to 
 
36 
 protect the confidentiality of participants.  Thus, the potential for experiencing an adverse 
event is minimal.  
There is a risk that the p articipant may get pregnant while enrolled in the study. This risk is 
the greatest during the first few weeks of the study before the participant starts their contraceptive.  To reduce this risk we will ask the participant to either abstain from sex or use  
condoms during this time. If pregnancy occurs during the study, we will refer the patient for further care.   
Each of the four study visits  consist s of a brief interview,  blood collection, pelvic 
examination, and vaginal sample (swab and lavage) collection . The potential additional risks to 
participating include discomfort from the blood draw and gynecologic exam with specimen collections , as outlined below:  
1. The standard risks of phlebotomy : Skin i rritation at the collection site, some b leeding, 
bruising, fainting, and pain are risks associated with blood collection. There is also a very small risk of infection at the collection site.  
2. Discomfort from physical and gynecologic examination: Gynecologic examinations may cause both physical and emotional discomfort.  
3. The risks associated with  suspicion of a STI or  vaginitis : Individuals who test positive or 
have any suspicious examination finds concerning for any infections during the research evaluation, will be referred for clinical evaluation and/or treatment. Individuals  diagnosed 
with an STI may experience emotional disco mfort upon receiving their diagnosis or upon 
notifying sexual partners, which would be recommended  by their provider   during 
 
37 
 counseling if a test result  is positive .  
4. Risks associated with their selected contraceptive – including routine risks during insertion 
and side effects.  
Risks associated with cervical or vaginal biopsy collection is bleeding and infection. Subjects will be 
informed on how to care for the area and to contact the PI or their medical care provider if there is a persistent  smell, bleeding or discomfort. These procedures are not anticipated to be 
associated with any deleterious impact on participants’ health or well -being.  
 
6.2 Protection against risks 
In implementing this protocol, we will be following HHS guidelines for research practices outlined 
on 45 CFR 46 (also known as the common rule).  The investigators will adhere to the basic 
principles of “Good Clinical Practice” as outlined in Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR) 312, subpart 
D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” CFR  21, part 50, and CFR 21, part 56 and 
Section 4 of International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for 
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use ( ICH) Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice. Specifically, we will provide c areful training of study personnel who interview or 
collect participant samples. T raining will include a component on careful patient counseling to 
enable the counselor to recognize complications , and when indicated, provide  immediate  referral 
for evaluation. A study participant will be informed of the voluntary nature of this study and that they may elect to not answer certain questions or to discontinue participation in the study at any time.   Additionally, comprehension of study procedures will be assessed by study staff prior to 
 
38 
 signing the informed consent form.   Study staff will first review the informed consent document.  
After reviewing the consent document, the research staff member will ask the participant the 
appropriate comprehension questions (see Appendix B ).  If a participant incorrectly responds to 
one of the comprehension questions, the staff member will further clarify study procedures.  Those participants who incorrectly respond on a second attempt, will be ineligible to participate in 
the study.  Risks from receiving the contraceptive will b e minimized  by ensuring that a qualified 
trained clinician performs all insertions and a comprehensive consent for that contraceptive is reviewed prior to their receipt of the contraceptive as part of routine clinical practice at the clinic.  
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records that leave the site 
to collaborating laboratories will be identified by  a coded number only , to maintain subject 
confidentiality. All study records will be kept in a locked  cabinet or o n password -protected 
computers that will be stored in locked cabinets , accessible only to Emory based study research 
staff. The clinical data  associated with the pelvic examination and placement of the contraception 
that would correspond to routine clinical care data  will be shared with the patients clinical care 
provider , and included in their Grady electronic medical record ,. This information in the electronic 
medical record is available to all members of the participant ’s clinical care team . We wi ll 
encourage patients to share their results with any hea lth care providers they have outside of the 
Emory or Grady setting , if they wish ; however we will not attempt to contact these providers 
directly. For sexually transmitted diseases that are identifie d, a clinician on the research team will 
contact the individual directly via phone to discuss results and clinical referral. As study samples 
will be processed in a research lab, these results can not independently be acted on for clinical 
 
39 
 managemen t, thus  patients will be referred for clinical care.  For any positive results identified 
during their research visit, such as a positive pregnancy test or vaginitis, a clinician from the 
research team will be available to counsel the patient at that visit on their results and discuss referral for care.  
Any other clinical information will not be released without written permission of the 
subject, except as necessary for monitoring by IRBs at participating institutions  or the Office for 
Human Research Protection . The study may be discontinued at any time by an  IRB at a 
participating institution or the Office for Human Research Protection.  
6.3 Benefits to p articipation  
The benefits of this research extend to potentially leading to improvements in the 
reproductive health care provided at the facility.  Moreover, the results could potentially impact individuals globally as we aim to better understand transmission of infections such as HIV, which can improve or b etter target our methods of prevention.  Participants will receive a $50 
compensation for each study visit, including their screening visit with a maximum of $250 received if she completes all study activities.  
6.4 Importance of the knowledge gained  
The cur rent study could help us to better understand the biologic effects of hormonal 
contraception on HIV transmission risk. If hormonal contraception increases the risk of 
transmission, dual protection methods with non -hormonal methods, such as the copper IUD and 
condoms , may be an important alternative strategy. The knowledge gained from this research may 
be used on multiple levels to help prevent unintended pregnancy, HIV transmission, and STI 
 
40 
 infection.. Study findings will be disseminated further via ab stracts submitted to scientific 
meetings  and manuscripts submitted to peer -reviewed journals.  
 
6.5 Limitations and Future Directions  
By design the study does not directly address the risk of HIV acquisition from hormonal 
contraceptives; rather, it explores  surrogates that might provide a mechanistic explanation to this 
purported impact of contraceptive hormone use. Being exploratory in nature, the sample size is 
small, and we may not be able to detect small differences in some of the outcomes. We have 
caref ully selected our markers to focus on our study aims, however we acknowledge that 
additional markers may be of interest and can be explored in future evaluations. Additionally, the 
design is limited by all the inherent biases and confounding associated with a non- randomized, 
non-blinded study design. Attempts to control for covariates will be performed in the analysis. 
Further, as our follow -up is limited to 3 months, we cannot evaluate the impact of long -term 
contraceptive use nor the effect of irregular bleeding on HIV risk. Furthermore, we acknowledge that many other factors that influence HIV susceptibility warrant further investigation, such as epithelial integrity  and endogenous microbicides. We plan to use these banked samples to explore 
some of these  other potential mechanisms in future research.  The data generated from the 
successful completion of this study will be instrumental in the design of a future prospective contraceptive trial to explore HIV acquisition risk and to establish safe family planning options for high- risk women .

6.6 Inclusion of w omen, minorities, and c hildren  
Pursuant to H HS policy, women (females over the age of 21) , members of minority 
groups, and children should be included in biomedical and behavioral clinical research 
projects involving human subjects.  The proposed study conforms to this policy.  
 
7 Mon itoring and Oversight  
7.1 Site m onitoring  
Site monitoring may be performed by the Emory University’s IRB and Office of Research 
Compliance, OHRP, FDA, or other government regulatory authorities.  Clinical research site 
monitoring may include the review of the individual participant records, including consent forms, 
CRFs, supporting data, laboratory specimen records, and medical records (physicians’ progress notes, nurses’ notes, individuals’ hospital charts) to ensure protection of study participants, compliance with the protocol, and accuracy and completeness of records.  The monitors may als o 
inspect sites’ regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements are being followed. The investigator will make study documents (e.g., consent forms, CRFs) and pertinent hospital or clinic records readily available for inspection.  
7.2 Data quality assurance and p rotection  
There will be study protocol and procedure training for all study personnel prior to beginning of 
the study. A standard operations manual will be available to staff to refer to for operational details in running the study.  
Each woman screened will be assigned a participant identification number ( PIN) at the time of 
study  entry . The PIN will be used on all data forms, specimens and communications related to the study. 
 
42 
 Samples will be labeled at the time of collection and proc essing using study labels. Clinical research 
forms (CRFs) will be used to collect all study related data, including demographic, clinical, and 
laboratory data at study entry, and additional clinical data at subsequent study visits. Subjects will 
be identified only by the  PIN on the CRFs. To maintain subject confidentiality, only a coded number 
will identify all stored laboratory specimens, forms, reports and other records.  All records will be kept in locked file cabinets, accessible only by local study st aff. Electronic files will be password -protected, with 
access only by authorized study personnel. Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring from funding agencies and designees or 
except as mandated by law.  
The study investigators will provide instructions concerning the recording of study data on 
CRFs.  It will be the responsibility of the study investigator to assure the quality of computerized 
data. This role extends  from protocol development to generation of the final study databases. 
Data from screening forms and study visit will be entered into Microsoft Access 2007. Electronic 
data will be secured in a password protected database that is accessible to members of t he Emory 
investigative team.  The Emory study investigators will maintain the link in a separate file that 
associates subjects with their PIN . 
 Staff will double -enter data using appropriate software. The data entry screens will be 
prepared with built -in quality control checks.  To safeguard against loss of data, backups of the 
data will be made.  Study staff will train the data entry staff in all data management procedures. We will conduct all statistical analyses using the SPSS System for Windows version 18.0, SAS Proc 
Mixed (version 9)  or similar analysis software program. The database and the laboratory data 
 
43 
 generated by this study will be maintained at Emory and will be accessible to collaborators. The 
principal investigators will be responsible for documentation of these data .   
The initial data entry and maintenance of laboratory data, identified only by PIN,  
generated will be the responsibility of the laboratory investigator generating and entering the data 
and of study investigators  who will oversee data quality.  
7.3 Protocol violation  
A protocol violation is any intentional or unintentional change from the IRB -approved 
protocol that adversely affects (1) the risk/benefit ratio of the study , (2) the rights, safety, or 
welfare of the participants or others, or (3) the integrity of the study. Examples include breach of confidentiality, inclusion of ineligible participants, or initiation of study procedures before participant has signed the consent form. If a protocol violation were to occur, it would be documented on the appropriate protocol deviation report form , and if the violation were to meet 
reporting requirements, it would promptly be reported to the participating IRBs.  
7.4 Adverse events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any health -related reaction, effect, toxicity or abnormal 
laboratory result that a study participant experiences during the course of the study, irrespective of relationship to the study intervention. This includes changes in a participant’s condition or labora tory results that have or could have a deleterious effect on a participant’s health or well -
being. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any experience that is fatal or life -threatening, 
requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of an exist ing hospitalization, or results in a 
persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
 
44 
 This study includes interviews, blood  draws , pelvic examinations,  and vaginal sample (swab 
and lavage) collections. These activities  are not anticipated to be associated with any deleterious 
impact on participants’ health or well -being. AEs will be managed according to good clinical 
practice and the judgment of the on- site physician. All clinical and laboratory AEs will be followed -
up closely by study staff. Any SAEs will be expeditiously reported to the principal investigators, via 
a designated SAE form. Notification and submission of SAE forms should occur within 48 hours of 
the site awareness of the SAE. The PI will then make the final independent judgment as to the severity, relatedness, and anticipated or unanticipated nature of the SAE and finalize the Human 
Subjects Adverse Event Report Form. If the event is determined to be serious, unanticipated, and 
the relationship is anything  other than probably or definitely not related, then the PI will report 
the event within 48 hours and submit the required  forms to the IRB at Emory and Grady will be 
simultaneously notified. Thus, all anticipated SAEs that are at least possibly related to  study 
intervention and all deaths that are at least possibly related to study intervention will be submitted to Emory IRB, and Grady ROC .  
 
8 Statistical Considerations and Analysis  
Sample Size/Statistical Considerations : We used the preliminary data from  CVL of healthy women 
(unpublished) for our power analysis (CCR5: n=17, mean = 17.6%, Standard deviation (SD) = 17.4%, 
CD38 n=6, mean =41.9%, SD=11%), using the SD from the cross sectional data as an estimate for the SD for change. Due to the expected correlation between repeated -measures, this is a 
conservative estimate as the standard deviation for change should be smaller than the observed between -subject standard deviation. For evaluating change following exposure to any 
 
45 
 contraceptive method (compared to no method), a sample size of 90 women achieves statistical 
power exceeding 95% to detect a CCR5  increase of 10% (or larger) (two- sided one -sample t -test on 
change, 5% α- level ). Similarly, with a sample size of 90 women, we achieve statistical power 
exceeding 95% to detect an increase in CD38 of 10% (or larger) from before to after any 
contraceptive exposure. Comparing the different contraceptives, assuming an increase of 25% i n 
CCR5 in the DMPA group and an increase of 10% in Nexplanon group and Mirena IUD  group (pre 
to post exposure), a sample size of 30 women per contraceptive group ( Nexplanon vs. DMPA or 
Mirena IUD  vs. DMPA) will achieve 90% statistical power to detect a con traceptive group 
difference of 15% (2 -sided two -sample t -test on change, 5% α -level).  Similarly, assuming an 
increase of 20% in CD38 expressing T- cells in the DMPA group and an increase on average of 10% 
in Nexplanon group and Mirena IUD  group, a sample size of 30 women per contraceptive group 
will achieve 93% statistical power to detect a contraceptive group difference of 10%.  
Data Management and Statistical Analysis : Study data will be recorded on case report forms and 
entered into a web -based password- protected relational database (REDCap). Repeated -measures 
analyses using mixed linear models will be performed with the assistance of Emory CFAR biostatistical core for study endpoints and  analyzed with SAS Proc Mixed (version 9) providing 
separate estimat es of the means by contraceptive method and time on study before (weeks 1 and 
3) and after (15 and 17 weeks) contraceptive administration. An unstructured variance -covariance 
form among the repeated measurements will be assumed for each outcome and estimates of the standard errors of parameters will be used to perform statistical tests and construct 95% confidence intervals.   The model -based means are unbiased with unbalanced and missing data, 
 
46 
 assuming missing data are non- informative and random. Mean chang es over time for each 
contraceptive method will be tested for linear trend.   Data will be summarized using adjusted 
means and observed differences plus 95% confidence intervals. Statistical tests will be 2 -sided.   A 
P value ≤ 0.05 will be considered statis tically significant.   
 For multivariable repeated -measures analyses, a mixed linear model will be fit including age, 
body mass index, race and parity as potential baseline confounders in addition to contraceptive 
method, time on study and the interaction between time on study and contraceptive method. The multivariable results will be summarized with adjusted means and 95% confidence intervals. The 
adjusted mean for each contraceptive subgroup (DMPA, Nexplanon, copper IUD  and Mirena IUD ) 
will be defined as the mean response obtained by fitting the statistical model at the mean age and 
the mean BMI of the three subgroups and averaged across levels of the other risk factors. To integrate time -dependent variables, such as BV and PSA, into the longitudinal analy ses, each 
participant at each of the 4 scheduled visits will be classified as positive or negative for each variable. Outcome change will be compared between incident cases and the other women (baseline positive and those that remain negative) after adjusting for the other covariates.  
9 Dissemination of Results  
The results will be disseminated in the form of abstracts submitted to scientific meetings 
and manuscripts submitted to peer -reviewed journals.

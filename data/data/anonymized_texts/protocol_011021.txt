This amendment is considered to be substantial  based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union because it either significantly impacts the safety or physical/mental integrity of participants or the scientific value of the study.
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:
To update the sample size and assumptions underlying its calculation and revise certain 
inclusion and exclusion criteria in response to investigator feedback.

Clinical Study Protocol – Amendment Number 5.0 AstraZeneca
MEDI3506 - D9180C00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 17 of 155Participants will be enrolled for at least a 4-week screening/run-in period, a 28-week 
intervention period (during which they receive 7 doses SC Q4W), and an 8-week follow-up period.
Participants must be on stable doses of dual therapy (ICS + LABA, or LABA + LAMA) or 
triple therapy (ICS + LABA + LAMA) for ≥3 months prior to enrolment and should remain 
so during the study. There should have been no change in maintenance COPD treatment after 
a previous exacerbation prior to entering into the study.
There is one sub-study included as part of the trial: .Disclosure Statement : This is a parallel group treatment study with 2 arms (MEDI3506 and 
placebo) that is participant, investigator, and sponsor blinded.
Number of Participants:
Approximately 144 participants will be randomly assigned to study intervention (MEDI3506 
or placebo) such that approximately 140 participants are evaluable for the primary analysis.
Intervention Groups and Duration:
All participants passing the init ial screening visit w ill enter a run-in period of at least 4 weeks 
on their usual standard of care treatment. Participants will be randomized to MEDI3506 or 
placebo if they continue to meet all eligib ility criteria, including adherence to home 
assessments and spirometry criteria using data from the run-in period. 
Approximately 144 participants will be randomized 1:1 to MEDI3506  SC Q4W or 
placebo for 7 doses.
Data Monitoring Committee: 
A DSMB has been established to oversee the MEDI3506 clinical development program. In 
addition to a full DSMB 6-month periodic review of safety data, the DSMB chair will review 
unblinded safety data summaries every 3 months; the DSMB can meet on an ad hoc basis. A 
blinded study-specific safety committee (or Medical Monitor) will also review SAEs and 
SUSARs.Statistical Methods:
A sample size of 140 participants (70 participants per arm) will provide 80% power to detect a 
difference in mean change from baseline in FEV

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 18 of 155Statistical Analyses:
The primary estimand is a ‘Treatment Policy’ estimand, as follows: The difference in mean 
change from baseline in FEV 1at Week 12 (MEDI3506 – placebo) will be estimated using a 
repeated measures mixed effects analysis of covariance model, for the ITT population. This will include all available data from all visits up to and including Week 12, irrespective of 
whether the participant discontinued study intervention or received reliever therapy. The model will include fixed effects for baseline, eosinophil strata, background medication strata, visit, study intervention, and the baseline by visit, and study intervention by visit interactions. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to describe the correlations between observations on a participant between visits.
A similar approach will be taken for the analysis of cough VAS, BCSS,  SGRQ, and 
. Data may be log-transformed prior to analysis where appropriate. Change 
from baseline in objective cough parameter s and os cillometry param eters at Week 12 w ill be 
analyzed using analysis of covariance.
Analysis of time to event  will include available data (up to 
Week 28 where this is available) for all participants  Time to event endpoints will be analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model. 
Safety endpoints including AEs,  SAEs, AESIs, laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECGs, and 
physical examinations will be summarized using descriptive statistics.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 19 of 155Participants will receive 7 administrations of study intervention Q4W. SV12 (Week 28) will 
serve as the end of intervention visit (see Section 4.1). The primary endpoint visit occurs at 
SV8 (Week 12).
1.3 Schedule of Activities
Patient reported outcome questionnaires to be completed at site visits must be completed prior 
to study intervention administration and ideally before any discussions of h ealth s tatus or 
other study procedures, such as collection of laboratory samples, to avoid biasing the participant’s responses to the questions. All daily ePRO assessments for the morning and evening eDiary at home should be completed within the set time window programmed into the 
device; device alerts will notify the participant when it is time to respond to the questions. After each study visit, participants will return to the normal schedule of answering the eDiary at home.
Order of procedures:
!All assessments should be performed prior to administration of investigational product 
except where otherwise indicated (eg, post-dose vital signs)
!Participants will be instructed to perform all home spirometry assessments before use of 
their usual standard-of-care inhaled medication. Whenever vital signs, ECGs, and blood draws are scheduled for the same nominal time, the order should be as follows: ECG, 
vital signs (vital signs can occur imm diately after ECG using the same rest period), then 
blood draws. The timing of the fir t 2 assessments should be such that it allows the blood 
draw (eg, PK blood sample) to occur at the assigned nominal t ime.
!AO assessments should take place before spirometry.
!Sputum samples should be taken after procedures requiring a BD withhold (including 
spirometry and AO).
!If both nasal epithelial li ing fluid and mucosal samples are required on the same day 
then the epithelial lining fluid sample should be taken prior to the mucosal sample.
Refer to Section 8for additional information on assessment ordering (eg, pre-, post-dose or 
multiple timepoints within a visit).'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

MEDI3506 - D9180C00002
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 27 of 1552 INTRODUCTION
MEDI3506 is a human IgG1 mAb that binds to human IL-33, which is being developed for 
the treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, COPD, and diabetic kidney disease. 
2.1 Study Rationale
The MEDI3506 pre-clinical profile suggests that MEDI3506 can reduce airway inflammation, 
improve epithelial integrity, reduce mucus production, and improve muco-ciliary transport. As 
such, MEDI3506 is hypothesized to impact COPD status by increasing FEV 1(and other 
physiolog ical measures of lung function) and reducing frequency and severity of COPD 
exacerbations, thereby improving quality of life.
One Phase I clinical study of MEDI3506 (Study D9180C00001) was completed in 
December 2019. Study D9180C00001 was a first-in-human, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded (investigator and participant blinded; sponsor unblinded) clinical study in 88 participants to evaluate the safety, to lerability, PK, and immunogenicity of single and 
repeated doses of MEDI3506. MEDI3506 was generally found to be safe and well tolerated. 
For further details refer to the IB.
The purpose of this proof-of-concept study is to  evaluate the safety and efficacy of MEDI3506 
in participants with COPD and chronic bronchitis. 
2.2 Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the fourth leading cause of death in the world and is projected  to be the third leading caus  of death worldwide by 2030 (Adeloye et al 2015) . 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is char acterized by persistent respiratory symptoms 
and airflow limitation (post-BD FEV
1/FVC < 0.70) that is due to airway and/or alveolar 
abnormalities, usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases, and 
influenced by host factors including abnormal lung development. Significant comorbidities may have an impact on morbidity and mortality ( GOLD 2020) . Chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease is not fully reversible, usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the lung. Patients with active chronic bronchitis symptoms bear a greater burden of disease than those without and are characterized by more rapid loss of lung function, increased mortality and increased risk of exacerbation ( Kim et al 2011;
de Oca et al 2012; Corhay et al 2013; Kim and Criner 2013; Woodruff et al 2016;Lahousse et al 2017) . Mucus hypersecretion wit h accumulation in  the small airways in COPD 
is present independent of symptoms of cough and sputum production ( Caramori et al 2004;
Burgel and Nadel 2008)  and can coexist with extensive emphysema (Dunican et al 2021;
Kim et al 2021) . Mucus plugging is evident at all stages  of severity of COPD, but is greatest 
in those with most severe disease. The correlation between extent of emphysema and mucus plugging is not well defined but both inde pendently negatively correlate with FEV

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 28 of 155with recurrent COPD exacerbations have higher sputum inflammatory markers 
(Bhowmik et al 2000)  which suggests that underlying inflammation may lead to disease 
progression ( Crooks et al 2000; Anzueto 2010) . Interleukin-33 expression is upregulated in 
the lungs of patients with COPD, is inversely correlated with lung function, and has a role in 
inflammatory and epithelial processes in COPD. 
MEDI3506 is a mAb that binds to IL-33 and potently and specifically blocks all forms of 
IL-33 to prevent their signalling. Interleukin-33 is  an alarmin cytokine from the IL-1 family. 
Interleukin-33 is localized in the nucleus, a nd following injury, stress or cell death, it is 
released from the cell, and exerts a pro-infl ammatory biological function, which is skewed 
towards a pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine profile and broad responder cell population on the background of smoke-induced inflammation (Kearley et al 2015) . Interleukin-33 pathway 
blockade prevents exacerbation of viral-indu ced inflammation in a mouse smoke exposure 
model ( Kearley et al 2015) , and IL-33 has been shown to have a role in goblet cell 
hypertrophy, mucus hypersecretion and the ratio of mu us producing to ciliated cells in 
airway epithelium in mouse models of prolonged lung inflammation ( Schmitz et al 2005;
Allinne et al 2019) . As such, MEDI3506 mode of action is hypothesized to impact airway
inflammation, mucus and cough symptoms and lung function endpoints in COPD, and through modification of these factors, reduce frequency and severity of exacerbations. This proposed mode of action of MEDI3506 suggests that COPD patients with chronic bronchitis may be most likely to gain benefit from MEDI3506 treatment, and therefore COPD participants with chronic bronchitis are an appropriate population to begin efficacy testing of 
MEDI3506. 
A detailed description of the chemistry, phar macology, mechanism of action, and safety of
MEDI3506 is provided in the IB.
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and potential risks of MEDI3506 may be found in the IB.
2.3.1 Risk Assessment
To date, there are no identified risks associated with MEDI3506. Potential risks for 
MEDI3506 are described in Table 4 and in more detail in the IB.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 32 of 155As per above, serious infections (including those with SARS-CoV-2) are also a potential risk 
of MEDI3506. AstraZeneca is not aware of any current evidence of a direct link between IL-33, or IL-33 suppression, and contracting SARS-CoV-2 and early stages of COVID-19 illness post infection. Moreover, it is hypothesised that IL-33 suppression might be beneficial in the later, hyperinflammatory phase of severe COVID-19 illness; MEDI3506 will be tested 
in patients with severe COVID-19 infections as part of the ACcelerating COVID-19 Research 
and Development (ACCORD) Study 2 (ACCORD-2; EudraCT number 2020-001736-95).
2.3.2 Benefit Assessment
The purpose of this p roof-of-concept study is to evalu ate the safety and efficacy of MEDI3506 
in participants with COPD and chronic bronchitis. For participants randomized to MEDI3506, 
there is a potential benefit in terms of improvement of their COPD disease status and reduction in COPD exacerbations. However, since at this early stage of clinical development, 
it is yet to be determined if MEDI3506 has an  effect in patients with COPD with chronic 
bronchitis, participants might not receive any individual benefit from participating in this 
study. Participants will be required to continue all their COPD maintenance treatment throughout the study to minimize the risk of disease status worsening during the study. 
To date, efficacy of MEDI3506 has not been assessed in patients with COPD and, hence, there 
are no clinical data that show benefit in th is population. However, safe ty data obtain ed during 
Phase I in participants with COPD and the pre-clinical scientific data support clinical 
development of MEDI3506 in COPD.
2.3.3 Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to participants in this study, the potential risks identified in association wi th MEDI3506 are justified by the anticipated 
benefits that may be afforded to participants with COPD with chronic bronchitis.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

4.1 Overall Design
For an overview of the study design see Table 1.  For details on study interventions given 
during the study, see Section  6. For details on what is included in the efficacy and safety
endpoints, see Section 3. For further details on assessments, including screening assessments, 
see Section 8.
This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, pl acebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study to 
assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of MEDI3506, administered SC Q4W for 7 doses, in participants with moderate or severe  COPD receiving standard of care (dual or triple 
therapy) as maintenance therapy, with a history of ≥1 moderate or severe acute exacerbation 
in the previous 24 months while on stable background treatment, and moderate to severe chronic bronchitis, with active sputum and cough symptoms. The intervention period lasts 
28 weeks (7 doses).
Improvement in FEV
1(primary endpoint) is considered important but not sufficient to show 
the potential of MEDI3506 to meet the unmet medical need in COPD. Therefore, 
COPDCompEx (secondary endpoint) will be used to assess whether MEDI3506 has wider clinical efficacy, specifically, that treatment with  MEDI3506 has the potential to reduce acute 
exacerbations. To enable evaluation of COPDCompEx, an intervention period of 28 weeks (7 doses) has been selected (see Section 4.2.3) .
Approximately 144 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to placebo or  of 
MEDI3506 SC Q4W, for 7 doses. The randomization will be stratified by 
 and background medication (includes ICS vs 
does not include ICS). 
There are 3 study periods: screening and run-in; intervention period; and follow-up (Table 1) .
Screening/Run-in Period
Informed consent and evaluatio n of inclusion/exclusion criteria (with the exception of CT, 
echocardiogram measures, and eDiary compliance) will be assessed at SV1. Only participants 
who meet all other eligibility criteria will be required to perform echocardiogram, CT and 
other scheduled assessments at screening SV2. Echocardiogram and CT dates will be scheduled at SV1, to occur post-confirmation of eligibility at SV2. SV1 and SV2 may be conducted over more than one clinic appointment to accommodate informed consent, echocardiogram, CT and sputum assessments; however, these must be completed in accordance with the SV window, per Table 2,  and to allow sufficient time for a radiologist 
review prior to SV3 (Randomization Visit). '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 39 of 155At the completion of initial enrolment at SV1, participants will proceed to the run-in period 
for at least 4 weeks, to allow adequate time for all the eligibility criteria to be evaluated. At approximately 1 to 3 weeks into the study period, SV2 will be conducted to further assess participant eligibility, including CT assessment of emphysema and echocardiogram. Sites should ensure there is adequate time to ensure results of CT and echocardiogram are available 
to determine eligibility. Computed tomography emphysema percentage will be calculated 
using automated software by an external vendor. Where an automated report is not possible due to technical issues, if possible, the CT scan emphysema percentage will be reported by a suitably qualified radiologist provided by the external vendor. Moreover, a suitably qualified radiologist at the clinic site (for clinical findi ngs outside of emphysema and morphometric 
assessment) will be required to review the CT for additional findings, before SV3. 
Presence or absence of excessive improvement in FEV
1will be assessed between SV1 and 
SV3 (period of at least 4 weeks). Acceptable adherence of eDiary completion, at-home 
assessments, and BCSS average score in cough and sputum domains will be assessed over the 
14 days preceding SV3. Participants who meet th e eligibility criteria will be randomized to 
study intervention.
During the screening period, the participant must undergo all assessments per Table 2
including biosampling and baseline CT evalua tion, with the exception of blood sampling for 
genomic assessments, which is optional. A previously performed chest CT scan may be acceptable for baseline evaluation, see Section 8.1.9.
Participants will be given a device at SV1, incorporating a spirometer for PEF/FEV
1and an 
eDiary for recording symptom and medication use including as-needed medication at home. 
This will be used to collect baseline data of spirometry, the eDiary (ER-S:COPD, BCSS, cough VAS item), and adherenc  during the screening/run-in period (at least 4 weeks). Participants will be instructed to perform all home spirometry assessments before use of their usual standard-of-care inhaled medication.
Participants entering the sub-study will have additional requirements during the 
screening period as set out in Section 8, as long as sub-study eligibility is confirmed for the 
individual participants. Sub-study participati on is dependent on site expertise / capability.
Participants will continue with stable doses  of permitted concomitant COPD medications from 
the screening through to the randomization visit. '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 40 of 155Intervention Period: 7 doses and EOT visit
Section 6.5.5 provides a list of medication restrictions and prohibitions to be followed 
throughout the conduct of the clinical trial.
A DSMB has been established to oversee the MEDI3506 clinical development program. 
Further details of the DSMB are found in Section 9.6.
Participants will be maintained on their currently prescribed maintenance therapies from 
enrolment throughout the run-in, intervention period and follow-up period. During the intervention period, the participant must undergo all assessments per Table 3,  with the 
exception of blood sampling for genomic assessments which is optional, and repeat 
 which is at the investigator’s discretion as detailed in 
Section 8.6.1.2.
Intervention Period
Participants fulfilling all eligibility criteria, including hose requiring a review of data gathered 
at SV2 assessment and SV3 pre-dose, will begin a randomized, placebo-controlled intervention period of 7 doses. The primary endpoint assessment occurs at Week 12. The final 
dose is administered at Week 24. The End of Intervention visit is at Week 28. MEDI3506 or 
placebo will be administered by SC injection Q4W.
Participants will be reviewed by a telephone visit after first dose visit and attend on site visits 
to perform assessments including biosampling, sp irometry and other functional measurements 
such as AO, as per the SoA (Secti n 1.3).
Participants will remain at the investigational site:
!After the first and second dose of study intervention: At least 2 hours post dose for 
observation; or until participant is stable; or the time taken to complete SoA, whichever is 
longest
!After Doses 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7: At least 1 hour post dose for observation; or until participant 
is stable; or the time taken to comp lete SoA, whichever is longest
Participants will be asked to complete the eDiary, home spirometry. In addition, all 
participants will be asked to wear a cough monitoring device for 24 hours immediately 
following study visits as per SoA (Section 1.3).
An automated alert will be provided to the participant and site if there is a significant 
deterioration in the eDiary data points, prompti ng the participant to co ntact the site or their 
treating physician for further clinical review and management of a possible AECOPD.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 41 of 155At clinic visits, participants will undergo a short assessment to confirm moderate or severe 
AECOPD including assessments of appropriate management.
Follow up Period
Follow-up visits will occur 4 and 8 weeks after EOT visit to allow for determination of 
immunogenicity and potential prolonged PD effects, and evaluation of safety. Participants will be discharged from follow-up 3 months af ter the last dose of study intervention.
The maximum amount of blood collected from each pa rticipant over the duration of the study, 
including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 450 mL in 3 months. 
Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with 
the samples.
Additional Visits
A clinical assessment of any potential exacerbation during the intervention and follow up 
periods will occur either at the next scheduled visit or, if necessary, an additional E/A visit 
prior to the next scheduled visit (see the SoA in Section 1.3).
For any participants with suspected heart failure during participation in the study, an ad hoc 
echocardiogram and NT-proBNP measurements are required. In addition, for these participants, vital signs, physical examinations and any other examinations (eg, chest X-ray) can be performed at the investigator’s discretion, following local standard practice.
4.1.1 Study (and Sub-Study) Conduct and Planned Mitigations During 
COVID-19 Pandemic 
Coronavirus disease 2019 has emerged as a worldwide pandemic disease with significant 
implications for public health. AstraZeneca accepts that a careful risk-benefit analysis should be performed in each region before init iating clinical research that impacts the clinical 
resources needed for the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, AstraZeneca will monitor countries and sites, and the study will not begin until local and national governments and clinical sites have indicated that it is acceptable to conduct clinical studies, any stay-in-place or lockdown 
orders have been lifted, and the safety of site staff and participants can be ensured. 
Furthermore, each study site must have appropri ate measures to ensure safety of site staff and 
participants.
It is recognised that depending on the location and facilities of a clinical site, study visit 
attendance may place participants at risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Where visits need to occur at locations other than the primary study site (eg, CT scans or echocardiograms), then '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 42 of 155the investigator should select appropriate locations given the current environment. It is 
accepted that additional visits (eg, as part of  participation) necessarily entail an additional risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, it is recognised that more ge neral population- level measures to reduce infection 
rates (eg, travel restrictions) may inhibit the ability of participants to attend study visits. 
Necessary healthcare responses at sites to the pandemic (eg, additional infection control 
measures) may also inhibit the ability of a clinical site to effectively and properly conduct the study. Study visit attendance for dosing and for clinical assessments of treatment response are critical for the scientific value of the study.
Therefore, investigators should not enrol participants unless they have reasonable confidence 
that throughout the duration of the study:
!Participants will be able to attend study visits, whilst avoiding contact with concentrations 
of COVID-19 patients (eg, hospital entr ances used by such patients); and
!The site will be able to conduct the study eff ectively and safely, considering relevant 
national and local factors.
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a repeated measures mixed effect model which, 
in the event of missing data, uses all data that are available.
AstraZeneca will routinely conduct risk-based enrolment assessments on a country and site 
level during the pandemic phase of COVID-19, and study monitoring will include:
!AEs associated with new onset SARS-CoV-2 infection
!Participants withdrawn due to COVID-19 illness
!Missed visits due t  COVID-19 related issues
!Other missing data.
It is accepted due to age, disease under study  and common comorbidities the target population 
has risk-factors for severe COVID-19 illness. The ability to exclude the most at-risk patients whilst maintaining the target population and the relevance of the study is  necessarily limited.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

not be included in the study (see Exclusion Criteria 1and2, Section 5.2):
1 Participants with active COVID-19 infection at screening.  
2 Participants with a history of significant C OVID-19 illness within 6 months of enrolment 
defined as:
(a) A diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia based on radiological assessment. 
(b) A diagnosis of COVID-19 with significant new findings from pulmonary imaging 
tests.
(c) A diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation and/or oxygen supplementation 
therapy.
Because the screening/run-in period is at least 4 weeks, participants will be tested for active 
SARS CoV-2 infection using a nucleic acid test targeting SARS-CoV-2 at both screening visits (see SoA [Table 2] ), and those with a positive result at either screening visit will become 
screen failures. This test may be performed  either at a local laboratory or at the central
laboratory.
Participants suspected of having contracted COVID-19 should be managed according to local 
and national guidelines to prevent spread of COVID-19 infection to staff and patients. These participants, as well as any who test pos itive for SARS-CoV-2, should not be au tomat ically 
discontinued from investigational product or be withdrawn from the study. Investigators should refer to Section  7when considering participant discontinuation or withdrawal 
decisions. Sites  will be required to provide docu mentation of a COVID-19 screening and 
mitigation plan that describes how and where participants would be tested if they are 
suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. The plans should also describe mitigation activities designed to protect site staff a d others at the site, including other participants and patients. Appendix J contains an example screening questionnaire that may be used prior to each visit 
to identify participants with symptoms of, or recent risk factors for, SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Infection control measures should be followed in accordance with local and national 
guidelines including, but not limited to, staff screening and use of personal protective equipment.
4.1.1.1 Vaccination Against COVID-19
There is no clinical data available to assess the interaction (if any) of MEDI3506 with any 
COVID-19 vaccine.
The sponsor accepts that vaccination against COVID-19, when and where it is available and 
participants are eligible according to applicable guidelines, is in the participant’s best interest. '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 44 of 155Consequently, vaccination during the study is, in general, permitted and any delays in 
vaccination due to study participation should be minimized.
To help ensure the interpretability of safety d ata, receipt of COVID-19 vaccine (either first or 
subsequent dose) is prohibited within 30 days be fore randomization or within 7 days before or 
after any dose of IP (Section 6.5.5) . Receipt of, at least, the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine 
more than 30 days before randomization, without significantly delaying enrolment, should be 
preferred but may not be possible, eg, not locally available at the time, participant not eligible at the time, express participant decision not to be vaccinated. Otherwise, vaccination may be performed at any time outside the prohibited 7-day window before or after any dose of IP. If the (approximate) date of a subsequent dose of COVID-19 vaccination is known, then enrolment of the participant should be timed so that that dose is not within 30 days prior to scheduled randomization. If this d ate is not known then enrolment into study s hould not be 
delayed. If an enrolled participant does (unexpectedly) receive COVID-19 vaccine within 30 
days prior to scheduled randomization, the site should contact the AstraZeneca Study
Physician for advice on how the situation should be managed.
4.1.2 Study Conduct Mitigation During Study Disruptions Due to Cases of 
Civil Crisis, Natural Disaster, or Public Health Crisis
The guidance given below supersedes instructions provided elsewhere in this protocol and 
should only be implemented during cases of civil crisis, natural disaster or public health crisis 
(eg, during quarantines and resulting site closures, regional travel restrictions, and 
considerations if site personal or study participants become infected with SARS-CoV-2 or similar pandemic infections), which would prevent the conduct of study-related activities at sites, thereby compromising the study site sta ff or the participant’s ability to conduct the 
study. The investigator or designee should contact the study Sponsor to discuss whether the mitigation plans below sho ld be implemented.
To ensure continuity of the c linical study during a civil crisis, natural disaster or public health 
crisis, changes may be implemented to ensure the safety of study participants, maintain 
compliance with GCP, and minimise risks to study integrity.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 45 of 155Where allowable by local health authorities, ethics committees, healthcare provider guidelines 
(eg, hospital policies) or local government, these changes may include the following options:
!Pausing recruitment and screening of new participants
!If, for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic, a participant is not able to attend their 
scheduled visit within the ± 3 day visit windo w, they can have their visit rescheduled 
within 14 days of the original scheduled visit; however, visits that cannot be rescheduled 
within a 14 day window must be  skipped and participants should continue at the next 
scheduled visit.
!During the COVID-19 pandemic, on-site visits may be replaced by a telemedicine visit. 
Having a telemedicine visit with the participan ts will allow collection of data for AEs, 
concomitant medications, and adherence to the eDiary and ePRO measures to be reported 
and documented. The term telemedicine visit refers to remote contact with the 
participants using telecommunications technology including phone calls, virtual or video 
visits, and mobile health devices.
!Performance of clinic spirometry at an alterna tive location where the participant may 
perform spirometry manoeuvres under supervision, eg  conducted at participant’s home 
by qualified site staff.

refer to Appendix K.
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a heterogeneous disease (Segal and Martinez 2018)
and as such any proposed treatment should be targeted at the participants within that diagnosis most likely to respond, and with the greatest unmet burden of disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by airflow limitation (post-BD FEV
1/FVC < 0.70) that is 
not fully reversible, usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the lung. The Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify
Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) observation al study of 2163 participants with
moderate-to-severe COPD found a mean rate of decline of FEV
1of 33 mL/year over 3 years, 
with higher rates of FEV 1decline in the presence of current smoking, emphysema, and BD 
reversibility ( Vestbo et al 2011) . Research on the impact of chronic bronchitis in COPD 
patients on mortality and FEV 1decline in a population-based cohort, showed that COPD 
participants with chronic bronchitis (n = 172) had a greater FEV 1decline (-38 mL/year, 95% 
CI -61.7 to -14.6; p = 0.024) compared with COPD participants without chronic bronchitis, and also a higher risk of respiratory mortality (hazard r atio 2.16, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.17; 
p = 0.002) and increased risk of acute exacer bations (objective re sponse 4.0, 95% CI 2.7 to 
5.9; p < 0.001) (Lahousse et al 2017) . However, emerging evidence (Dunican et al 2021;
Kim et al 2021)  demonstrates mucus hypersecretion at all stages of COPD, evident on CT 
imaging alongside even very extensive emphysema. This accumulation of mucus in the small airways can occur in the absence of significant symptoms ( Hogg et al 2007) , likely as a result '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 46 of 155of the lack of cough receptors in the peripheral airways (Burgel and Nadel 2008) . Patients 
with recurrent exacerbations have higher sputum inflammatory markers (Bhowmik et al 2000)
which suggests that underlying inflammation may lead to disease progression, but yet may still contribute to the ongoing inflammation associated with disease progression (Anzueto 2010; Crooks et al 2000) . 
Patients with COPD and mucus hypersecretion therefore present a high unmet need. Current 
therapy for these patients consists of dual (ICS + LABA or LABA + LAMA) or triple therapies (ICS + LABA + LAMA), with add-on in the event of increased exacerbation historyof such treatments as PDE4 inhibitors, and chronic macrolide (such as azithromycin) 
treatment. These add-on treatments, however, have issues associated with individual tolerability and antibiotic resistance which have hampered their use. 
As discussed in Section 2.2, MEDI3506 mode of action is hypothesized to impact airway 
inflammation, mucus and cough symptoms, and lung function endpoints in COPD, and 
through modification of these factors, reduce frequency and severity of exacerbations.
This study tests the hypothesis that MEDI3506 will improve lung function in participants with 
COPD and chronic bronchitis, using FEV
1as the primary outcome measure. The study uses 
secondary outcomes to gather evidence to support the mode of action of MEDI3506, 
concentrating on lung physiology, mucus, cough, and ePROs related to symptoms and disease impact. 
There will be one sub-study in this trial: 
4.2.1 Rationale for Study Population
Chronic bronchitis by physician assessment of participant disease history (presence of cough 
and phlegm on most days for ≥ 3 months/year for ≥ 2 years) and BCSS average score ≥ 2 in 
cough and sputum domains over the 4-week run-in period allow not only the standard definition of chronic bronchitis history to be used to define participants who could benefit, but also to increase the chances of seeing a measurable effect size in BCSS and other symptom related measures. This BCSS inclusion criterion helps to identify those patients with 
symptomatic mucus hypersecretion most likely to respond to MEDI3506 due to its mechanism 
of action. However, the ability to score severity of emphysema on CT scan will also allow for '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 47 of 155analysis of subpopulations of patients with COPD based upon extent of emphysema to further 
examine the relationship between emphysema and response to MEDI3506.
During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as a result of changed patient behaviour, there has 
been a significant reduction in exacerbation frequency compared with previous years. Data from the UK suggested a 50% reduction in exacerba tion related-hospital admissions compared 
with pre-pandemic (Tan et al 2020; Alsallakh et al 2021) , and a 39% reduction in primary care 
consultations related to COPD. This picture is replicated in other countries. Leaving the requirement for at least one moderate or severe exacerbation in the previous 12 months unchanged would lead to the exclusion of patients who in previous years would have been included.
In this study, participants are required to have at least one moderate or severe exacerbation in 
the previous 24 months, as participants with frequent exacerbations have been shown to have an increased symptom burden and likelihood of subsequent exacerbations ( Hurst et al 2010) , 
and a history of exacerbation also results in poor outcomes irrespective of ICS use and for 
exacerbation history of ≥ 1 moderate exacerbation (Calverley et al 2017) . Participants should 
be clinically stable and free from an exacerbation of COPD for 1 month prior to SV1 and prior to Day 1.
4.2.2 Rationale for Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint is change from baseline to Week 12 in clinic pre-BD FEV 1.
Forced expiratory volume in 1 second is a validated and clinically important endpoint in 
COPD studies, and has been used extensively in trials used to support registration of add on 
therapy to current standard of care (dual/triple th erapy) in a similar chronic bronchitis patient 
population (Martinez et al 2015) . 
4.2.3 Rationale for Intervention Period Duration
The last dose is administered at Week 24 and the end of treatment is 4 weeks later (Week 28).
Based on available data, the improvement in FEV 1assumed in the sample size determination 
(Section 9.2) is expected to be achieved by Week 12. However, improvement in FEV 1is 
considered important but not sufficient to meet the unmet medical need in COPD. To enable 
evaluation of the secondary endpoint of COPDCompEx, the treatment is continued after collection of primary endpoint data, to collect further events.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 48 of 1554.2.4 Participant Input into Design
The AstraZeneca Patient Partnership Program is an internal working group that enables study
participant feedback on clinical trial study designs. During study development, the Patient 
Partnership Program influenced the following aspects of the study design:
!Provision written into the CSP to rotate injection sites.
!Participant training for the eDiary and spirometry devices used at home will be supported 
by trouble shooting and technical guidance
!Participants may be provided with a sing le source study guide providing study rationale 
and guidance in seeking additional support from sites (does not directly affect the CSP).
!There may be ongoing communications with participants such as newsletters and regular 
site contact (does not directly affect the CSP).
!Site facilities were explored to  support participant focused visits such as out of office or 
TC visits (does not directly affect the CSP).
!A centralized recruitment program may be used.
!Nasal sampling will not be repeated in participants that are unsuitable for repeat sampling 
as judged by the Investigator.
In addition, a study coordinator review of the SoA took place in order to ensure the SoA was 
feasible and realistic, particularly in terms of visit duration. This consultation led to the following alterations to the SoA:
!Provision for allowing informed c nsent at a separate, stand-alone visit has been included 
in the CSP.
!Detailed guidance has been included to clarify the order of assessments in Section 8.
!Duration estimates for visits were confirmed.
4.3 Justification for Dose
In this proof-of-concept st udy, a dose regimen of  Q4W SC will be administered for 
7 doses. This dose is predicted to have a lower exposure, in terms of C max,ss (approximately 
2.4-fold) and AUC (approximately 1.1-fold), compared with the highest dose administered (ie, single dose of  IV MEDI3506) in the Phase I clinical study (Study D9180C00001; refer to IB for further details).
Exposures (ie, C
max,ss of 1276μg/mL and AUC 0-4 weeks of 28012 μg day/mL) achieved at the 
26-week no observed adverse effect level of 150 mg /kg in cynomolgus monkeys (refer to the 
IB for further detail) are approximately 38- to 47-fold higher than predicted at the proposed 
maximum dose of  SC Q4W in this Phase II clinical study. '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 49 of 155The optimal serum concentration for MEDI3506 efficacy in COPD is not known. A mouse 
challenge model suggests a target concentration of 20 μg/mL (refer to the IB for additional 
details). Analysis of the PK data from the Phase I clinical study of MEDI3506 predicts that 
 SC Q4W will achieve an average steady-state concentration of 21 μg/mL, similar to 
the target concentration established in the mous e model. In addition, this dose is predicted to 
achieve > 90% suppression of IL-33 in the sputum based on the theoretical PK/PD model. If
replicated in humans with COPD,  SC Q4W is anticipated to achieve near-maximum efficacy based on the mouse and PK/PD models.
4.4 End of Study Definition
The end of the study is defined as the date of last scheduled procedure shown in the SoA (Table 3)  for the last participant in the study globally.
4.4.1 Study Stopping Criteria
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study  as a whole are handled in accordance with 
Appendix A9 .
The study may be put on hold pending a full safety  data review, if any of the following criteria 
are met:
!Five or more (in different participants) reports of new onset symptomatic heart failure 
confirmed by echocardiography1
!Four or more (in different participants) reports of Grade 5 severity infection (excluding 
COVID‑19 infection), not ass ciated with a COPD exacerbation1
!Two or more (in different participants) reports of new onset non ‑infective colitis, 
confirmed histopathologically
!Two or more cases of ≥Grade 4 severity hypersensitivi ty reactions (e g, anaphylaxis),

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 50 of 155If the sponsor determines that temporary suspension  or termination of the study is required, 
the sponsor will discuss the reasons for taking such action with all participating investigators 
(or heads of the medical institutions, where applicable). When feasible, the sponsor will provide advance notice to all participating investigators (or heads of the medical institutions, where applicable) of the impending action.
If the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons, the sponsor will promptly inform all 
investigators, heads of the medical institutions (where applicable), and/or institutions conducting the study. The sponsor will also promptly inform the relevant regulatoryauthorities of the suspension/termination along with the reasons for such action. Where 
required by applicable regulations, the investigator or head of the medical institution must 
inform the IRB/IEC promptly and provide the reason(s) for the suspension/termination. If the 
study is suspended for safety reasons and it is deemed appropriate by the sponsor to resume 
the study, approval from the relevant regulatory  authorities (and IRBs/I ECs when applicable) 
will be obtained prior to resuming the study. The investigator shall also promptly inform the participant of the study suspension/terminatio n and should assure a ppropriate participant 
therapy and/or follow-up.
5 STUDY POPULATION
Each participant must meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria 
(excluding sub-study specific criteria) for this study in order to be assigned/randomized to the 
study intervention. Under no circumst nces can th ere be exceptions to this rule. Participants 
who do not meet the eligibility requirements are screen failures (refer to Section 5.4). 
Participants who provide informed consent to  participate in the CT sub-study but are 
subsequently found not to meet all of the inclusion  criteria and/or meet any of the exclusion 
criteria, applicable to the sub study, should not participate further in the sub-study but should 
continue to participate in the main study so long as they are eligible as described above.
In this CSP, “enrolled” participants are defined as those who sign the ICF. “Randomized” 
participants are defined as those who undergo randomization within the RTSM system. 
Prospective approval of CSP deviations to eligibility criteria, also known as CSP waivers or 
exemptions, is not permitted.
5.1 Inclusion Criteria
Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria apply:
Age:
1 Participant must be 40 to 80 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the ICF.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 59 of 1555.3.2 Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco
Chronic alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years is restricted prior to SV1 and throughout the 
conduct of the study.
Current tobacco smokers or prior tobacco smokers, with smoking history ≥10 pack-years 
(1 pack-year = 20 cigarettes smoked per day for 1 year) at SV1 are allowed. Never smokers are not allowed to enter the study. Any change in smoking status in 12 weeks prior to enrolment or intention to change smoking status  between enrolment and end of follow-up will 
result in a screen failure. However, following ch ange in smoking status, they will be eligible 
for re-screening. Smoking status changes during the course of the study will be captured on the eCRF but the participant will be permitted to continue in the study. See also Section  8.
The use of e-cigarettes (eg, JUUL) is allowed during the course of the study. 
5.3.3 Activity
1 Participants should avoid engaging in st renuous exertion for at least 30 minutes prior to 
all scheduled l ung function assessments, AO and blood collection at the site.
2 Participants should avoid showers/bath ing and any activity that will cause heavy
perspiration whilst wearing the cough monitor, as the cough monitor must not come into contact with water.
5.4 Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but 
are not subsequently randomly assigned to study intervention. A minimal set of screen failure 
information is required to ensure t ansparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal i nformation includes demography, screen failure 
details, eligibility criteria, and any SAEs.
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be 
rescreened, if there is reason to believ e the reason for ineligibility was temporary (eg. 
exacerbation and/or background medication stability periods). Only one rescreening per 
participant is allowed in the study, when there is a reasonable expectation that the participant 
will become eligible for the study. Prior to rescreening, participants must be reconsented. Participants in rescreening retain their previous E-code.
Where individuals are rescreened, the results of echocardiogram and IGRA (TB test) carried 
out as part of the original screening process can be included as long as they are within the last 3 months and there have been no specific risks of TB infection such as foreign travel to a high '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 61 of 1556.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability of Interventions
1 The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention.
2 Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention and only authorised 
site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study intervention must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorised site staff. 
3 MEDI3506 does not contain preservatives and, therefore, any unused portion must be 
discarded.
The unblinded study intervention manager will select the appropriate kits allocated by the 
RTSM system to prepare the participant’s dose. The unblinded study intervention manager 
must ensure that only the unblinded team members have access to the areas of the pharmacy 
where the study intervention is being stored and prepared.
6.2.1 Study Intervention Inspection
Each vial allocated for dose preparation should be inspected. MEDI3506 and placebo are supplied as a clear to opalescent sterile liquids  
If there are any defects noted with the study intervention, the investigator and site monitor 
should be notified immediately. Refer to the Product Complaint section in the IMP manual for 
further instructions.
6.2.2 Dose Preparation Steps
No incompatibilities between MED I3506 and plastics (ie, polypropylene and polycarbonate 
syringes) have been observed.
MEDI3506 and placebo do not contain preservatives and any unused portion must be 
discarded. Preparation of study intervention is to be performed aseptically. Total in use 
storage time from needle puncture of the study intervention vial to start of administration 
should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C (36 °F to 46 °F). If 
storage time exceeds these limits, a new dose must be prepared from new vials assigned by the RTSM system.
A vial should be used only 1 time to prepare a single dose.To prepare the participant’s dose, the unblinded study intervention manager will select study

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 63 of 155It is advised that the site of injection be rotated so that the participant receives study 
intervention injections in different anatomical regions from one visit to the next. In cases 
when rotation of the injection site is not feasible and/or the participant prefers not to rotate injection sites, the reason for not rotating the injection site should be documented in the source documents.
Each injection site must be documented on the eCRF and in the source documents at each 
study intervention visit.
6.2.2.2 Monitoring Dose Administration
After the administration of study interve ntion, vital si gns will be assessed according to the 
SoA (Section 1.3), and SC injection sites will be assessed for any reactions as detailed in 
Section 8.2.3.
As with any biologic product, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. Therefore, 
appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis 
(Appendix I) .
6.2.3 Accountability
The site’s designated unblinded study intervention manager is required to maintain accurate 
study intervention accountability records. U pon completion of the study, copies of study
intervention accountability records will be returned to AstraZeneca. All unused studyintervention and vials will be disposed of following site procedures and upon author ization by 
AstraZeneca, or will be returned to an AstraZeneca-authorized depot if a site is unable to 
dispose of unused study intervention. The outer carton should be kept onsite to assist with kit 
assignment checks, if permitted by site procedures.
6.3 Measures to Minimise Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1 Methods for Assigning Study Intervention Groups
All participants will be centrally assigned to randomised study intervention using an RTSM system and will be stratified by baseline eosinophil count (< 300 cells/ μL, ≥300 cells/ μL) and 
background medication usage (ICS or no ICS). 
Before each site is initiated, the login informatio n and directions for the RTSM system will be 
provided.
Study intervention will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in SoA (Section 1.3). 
The RTSM system will provide to the investig ator(s) or pharmacists the kit identification 
numbers to be allocated .'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 64 of 155Routines for this will be described in the RTSM sys tem user manual that will be provided to 
each centre.
6.3.2 Methods to Ensure Blinding
Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive study intervention (MEDI3506 
 or placebo). Investigators will remain bli nded to each participant’s assigned study
intervention throughout the course of the study.
Since MEDI3506 and placebo are not identical, study intervention will be handled by an 
unblinded study intervention manager at the site and will be administered by an unblinded study team member who w ill not be involved in the management of study participants. An 
independent study intervention monitor will also be unblinded to perform study intervention accountability. In the event that the study inte rvention allocation for a participant becomes 
known to the investigator or other study staff involved in the management of study
participants, AstraZeneca must be notified immediately . If the study intervention allocation for 
a participant needs to be known to treat an individual participant for an AE (Section 6.3.3) , the 
investigator must notify AstraZeneca immediately . The site will maintain a written plan 
detailing which staff members are blinded/unblinded and the process of study intervention preparation and administration used to maintain the blind.
In the event of a Quality Assurance audit, the auditor(s) will be allowed access to unblinded 
study intervention records at the site(s) to verify that randomization/dispensing has been done 
accurately.
To facilitate the in-stream analy is of PK and ADA samples, the randomisation schedule may 
be provided to limited personnel who have responsibility for analysing the samples. These unblinded sample analysts will not have any other involvement with the conduct of the study.
MEDI3506 could reduce eosinophil counts in blood over time. As a precaution, eosinophil, 
basophil, and monocyte data from the hematology  laboratory tests will not be communicated 
to blinded sponsor or site personnel during the intervention and follow-up periods. These data do not require blinding at baseline (SV1 to SV3 pre-dose).
6.3.3 Methods for Unblinding
The randomization code s hould not be broken except in medical emergencies when the 
appropriate management of the participant requires knowledge of the study intervention randomization. The investigator documents and re ports the action to AstraZeneca, without 
revealing the study intervention given to  participant to the AstraZeneca staff.
AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to study interve ntion and that potentially require expedited '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

analyses of data until all decisions on the ev aluability of the data from each individual 
participant have been made and documented.
The RTSM system will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions. In case of an 
emergency, in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study intervention will affect the 
immediate management of the participant’s condition, the investigator has the sole 
responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participants’ intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If a participant’s intervention assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The investigator documents and reports the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing the study intervention given to participant to the AstraZeneca staff.
6.3.3.1 Unblinding for Analysis Purposes
An interim analysis may be included in this study prior to the Primary Analysis. Should an 
interim be conducted, the purpose will be to inform decisions on future development options 
for MEDI3506 or other programs. No termination of this study or adjustments to the studydesign are planned since the interim analysis would be for administrative purpose only. 
An interim analysis will require unblinding of a group of sponsor staff or designated 
representatives including those with clinical  medical, statistical, and programming expertise, who will form a firewalled unblinded r view committee for administrative purposes. The unblinded review committee will be responsible for reviewing the interim results and will 
ensure that the review is performed in a way that maintains the integrity of the trial, and in 
accordance with the interim analysis unblinding plan, which will be prepared prior to the 
interim analysis. Sponsor staff and designated sponsor representatives who conduct the interim analysis will take no f rther part in any study activities after they are unblinded. They will not reveal the interim analysis results or study intervention codes to any of the study team
member (sponsor staff or representative) who will remain blinded and continue to be involved in the study’s conduct until completion as originally planned. In addition, interim analysis results will not be shared with investigators  or participants. The scope and additional details 
on interim analyses are provided in Section 9.5.
There are 3 planned analyses for this study as described in Section 9.5. Personnel from 
AstraZeneca or its representatives directly asso ciated with the conduct of this study will
remain blinded until the completion of the Primary Analysis. Personnel from the study sites, and the study participants, will remain bli nded until the completion of the Final Analysis.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

When participants are dosed at the site, they will receive study intervention directly from an
unblinded Product Administrator, who is appropriately trained. The date and time of the dose administered (first injection) in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents and recorded in the eCRF.
6.5 Concomitant Therapy
The investigator must be informed as soon as possible about any medication taken from the time of screening until the final study visit. Any concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations, taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF.
Investigators may prescribe concomitant medications or treatments that are:
!not prohibited (see Section 6.5.5) ,
!neither compromise participant safety not aff ect study data, as judged by the investigator; 
and
!deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care.
Specifically, participants should receive full supportive care during the study, including 
intermittent treatment with antibiotics, anti metics, an ti-diarrheals, and analgesics, and other 
care as deemed appropriate, and in accordance with their institutional guidelines. The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any que stions regarding concomitant or prior therapy.
Participants are recommended to be vaccinated against influenza and pneumonia according to 
local schedule. Vaccination is permitted during the study but not within ±7 days of dosing.
6.5.1 Required Maintenance Therapy for COPD
All participants are required to be treated with stable doses of maintenance dual inhaled (ICS + LABA or LABA + LAMA) or triple inhaled therapy (ICS + LABA + LAMA) for COPD for at least 3 months prior to enrolment (SV1). Both dual and triple therapy may be in the form of separate inhalers or fixed dose combination inhalers but may not be in nebulized form. However, all inhalers must be locally approved for the maintenance treatment of COPD. Maintenance treatment should remain unchanged throughout the duration of the study (except 
for treatment of COPD ex acerbations, see Section 6.5.4) . If a change in COPD maintenance 
treatment is required, it must be discussed with the medical monitor.
Note: The Spiriva Respimat device is considered to be an inhaler.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

The following medication withhold periods should be observed prior to scheduled spirometry
and AO at site:
!SABA and SAMA for at least 6 hours prior.
!Twice daily LABA or LAMA-containing therapies for at least 12 hours prior.
!Once daily LABA or LAMA-containing therapies for at least 24 hours prior.
If any of the restrictions are not met and th e spirometry s ssion cannot be sufficiently delayed 
on the day, it should be  rescheduled within the allowed visit window.
Spirometry assessments will also be performed at home daily (except on days when the 
participant is attending at site visits). Instructions regarding the participant’s medication and home spirometry sequence are described in Section 8.1.3
6.5.4 Treatment of Exacerbations of COPD
In general exacerbations of COPD should be treated according to the judgment of the treating 
physician in line with local guidelines.
Both systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics used to treat a COPD exacerbation should not be 
used for more than 14 day  If treatment duration is expected to exceed 14 days, the medical monitor must be contacted  An increased dose of ICS may be used alongside OCS, however it 
should be returned to usual maintenance dose at resolution of the exacerbation.
Medications may be administered by nebulizer if required during the course of an 
exacerbations. Scheduled use of SABA/SAMA and oxygen supplementation is permitted during the course of an exacerbation.
6.5.5 Restricted and Prohibited Medications
The following medications are restricted from SV1 to the end of the follow-up period, unless 
clinically indicated, as determined by a physician:
!Acute systemic (oral or injectable) corticosteroids within 4 weeks of SV1 until the end of 
the follow-up period, except for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD during the course of the study.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

If study intervention is permanently discontinued, the participant w ill remain in the study and 
attend all remaining intervention period and follow-up period visits.
See the SoA (Section 1.3) for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study
intervention and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.
An individual participant will not receive any further study intervention if any of the 
following occur in the participant in question:'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

7.2 Participant Withdrawal from the Study
!A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request. This is 
expected to be uncommon.
!A participant who considers withdrawing from the study must be informed by the 
investigator about modified follow-up options (eg, telephone contact, a contact with a relative or treating physi ian, or information from medical records).
!At the time of withdrawal from the study, if possible, an E/D should be conducted, as 
shown in the SoA (Section 1.3). See SoA for data to be collected at the time of study
withdrawal and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.
∀The participant will discontinue the stud y intervention and be withdrawn from the 
study at that time.
!If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.
!If a participant withdraws from the study, it should be confirmed  if he/she still agrees for 
existing samples to be used in line with the original consent. If he/she requests withdrawal 
of consent for use of samples, destruction of any samples taken and not tested should be 
carried in line with what was stated in the informed consent and local regulation. The
investigator must document the decision on use of existing samples in the site study
records and inform th e Global St udy Team.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 71 of 1557.3 Lost to Follow-up
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.
!The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a 
required study visit:
!The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study.
!Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, 
if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts shoul d be documented in the participant’s 
medical record.
!Should the participant c ontinue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study. 
!Site personnel, or an independent third party,  will attempt  to collect the vital status of the
participant within legal and ethical boundaries for all participants randomised, including 
those who did not get study intervention. Pub lic sources may be searched for vital status 
information. If vital status is determined as deceased, this will be documented and the 
participant will not be considered lost to follow-up. Sponsor personnel will not be 
involved in any attempts to collect vital status information.

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
!Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section 1.3). Clinical 
study protocol waivers or ex emptions are not allowed.
!Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
study intervention.
!Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study conduct.
!All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The i nvestigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

8.1.1 Clinic Spirometry
8.1.1.1 General Requirements
All spirometry is performed pre-dose.
Lung function (FEV 1and FVC) will be measured by spirometr y using equipment provided by 
a central vendor. Spirometry will be performed by the investigator or authorized delegate 
according to ATS/ERS guidelines (Miller et al 2005) .
The vendor providing central spirometry is responsible for assuring that the spirometer meets 
ATS/ERS recommendations and that the site personnel who will be performing the testing are properly certified. Spirometry calibration and data quality checks (including monitoring of unexpectedly high variability of results) will be detailed in a separate spirometry procedures 
manual and in the monitoring plan. Participants who exhibit unexpectedly high variability ofFEV
1will be evaluated by the investigator for etiology of variability, necessary follow-up 
actions, and assessment of continued participant eligibility. The investigator will discuss 
unexpectedly high variability with the AstraZeneca Study Physician.
Participants should observe the relevant medication withhold periods and other restrictions 
beforehand (see Section 5.3and Section 6.5.3)  If any of the restrictions are not met and the 
session cannot be sufficiently delayed on the day, the site visit and dosing should be 
rescheduled within the allowed visit window. All lung function measurements should take place prior to dosing, if dosing is also scheduled at the same visit.
Usual infection control measures should be followed including use of filters, per the 
instructions of the central vendor  Any additional infection control measures in accordance 
with COVID-19 related loc l and nati onal guidelines should also be followed.
Time of day for scheduled site visit spirometry
Spirometry testing should be performed at sp ecified visits according to the SoA (Section 1.3). 
Spirometry testing must be initiated in  the morning between 6:00 AM and 11:00 AM during 
the screening period and at the randomization visit (SV3). 
All post-randomization spirometry assessments should be performed within ± 1.5 hours of the 
time that the randomization spirometry was performed. For example, if the randomization spirometry was started at 8:00 AM, then all subsequent spirometry testing needs to be initiated between 6:30 AM and 9:30 AM.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

Detailed procedure for performing spirometry will be described in an instruction manual. 
Details regarding assessment of the quality of spirometry and the Best Test Review process 
will also be detailed in the manual and Monitoring Plan. 
Spirometry references
The Global Lung Function Initiative equations will be used to determine the PNV and are pre-
programmed into the spirometer (Quanjer et al 2012) . 
Forced expiratory volume in 1 second expressed as percent of the PNV, will be calculated as 
follows:
FEV 1% of PNV = (FEV 1measured/FEV 1PNV) × 100
8.1.1.2 Post-BD Spirometry
Post-BD spirometry will be performed at sp ecified visits as detailed in the SoA (Section 1.3).
Endpoint maximal BD will be induced using albuterol (90 μg metered dose) or salbutamol 
(100μg metered dose) with or without a spacer  device up to a max imum of 4 inhalations 
within 30 minutes ± 15 minutes of the fin al pre-BD spirometry measurement. Post-BD 
spirometry will be performed 15 to 30 minute  later.
Order of administration for the COPD maintenance medication and study intervention
relative to the scheduled pre- and post-BD spirometry
The participant’s usual COPD morning maintenance therapy must not be given until 
spirometry are complete in order to maintain th e integrity of planned efficacy analyses around 
lung function improvement. Study intervention dosing should also be withheld until pre-BD/post-BD spirometry is complete. 
Record keeping
A signed and dated copy of the pre- and post-BD printout must be kept at study centre for 
source data verification. The printout must be marked with the study code, enrolment code, date and time of measurement, visit number. If a printout cannot be printed, the mean value of the measurements will be recorded in the participant’s charts.
8.1.2 Airwave Oscillometry
Airwave oscillo metry will be performed at specified visits as detailed in the SoA
(Section 1.3), using the endpoints of R5-R20, R5, R20, and AX. Airwave oscillometry is a 
non-invasive lung function test included in this study, which will be assessed using an AO 
device. It is assessed during quiet, tidal breathing with no participant effort required, by superimposing a multi-frequency oscillation onto the participant’s natural breathing, to '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

A calibrated system will be used for measurements. Detailed procedures for equipment 
calibration, performance of measures, recording and analyzing AO data will be described in a separate manual provided to each site. Details regarding assessment of the quality of the AO 
process will also be detailed in the manual.
!All AO function measurements should take place prior to dosing, if dosing is also 
scheduled at the same visi t, and prior to spirometry.
!Participants should observe the medication wi thhold periods and lifestyle considerations 
stated in Section 6.5.3 and Section 5.3, respectively.
Note: If any of the above restriction are not met, the AO assessment should be rescheduled 
within the allowed visit window and should be conducted prior to spirometry.
8.1.3 Home Spirometry and eDiary
During the intervention period, participants w ill be required to monitor lung function at home 
using an at ‑home spirometry device for daily recording of FEV 1and PEF. This will be done 
once daily in the morning, with the same  time window recommendation as the clinic 
spirometry; however, the time window is not compulsory (ie, all data will be used for 
analyses). Participants will be instructed t  perform all home spirometry assessments before 
use of their usual standard-of-care inhaled medication.
Further details will be provided in a separate instruction manual provided to each site.
Participants will be trained on at-home use of the eDiary at SV1. The site staff will set 
assessment reminder alarms on the device (morning and evening). Training will emphasize the 
importance of completi g the eDiary assessments as scheduled to capture the participant’s experience and meet the objectives of the study. 
The investigator/authorized delegate will check participant’s adherence to the eDiary 
assessment schedule and also emphasize the importance of transmitting data daily as is necessary, to minimize missing data, and at each study visit. 
Every morning participants will perform home spirometry and use the eDiary answer the 
following questions / questionnaires:
!Major COPD symptoms (dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum color, see Appendix G)
∀Participant-reported worsening of 1 or more major COPD symptoms will trigger 
assessment of minor COPD symptoms (sore throat, cold, fever without other cause, cough, and wheeze).'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

Every evening participants will use the eDiary to answer the following questions / 
questionnaires:
!BCSS individual symptoms scores (cough, sputum, breathlessness, see Section 8.1.8.3)
!The ER-S:COPD (see Section 8.1.8.1)
!Cough VAS (see Section 8.1.8.2)
The eDiary will generate an alert to the participant and the investigational site if any of the 
following criteria are met:
!Worsening of 1 major COPD symptom and at least 1 other major or minor symptom for 
2 consecutive days.
!Fall in PEF by ≥30% from bas eline for 2 consecutive days
Baseline is defined as the average of 14 days prior to first dose of investigational product.
This alert should trigger a contact betwe n the participant and the investigational site. Alerts 
will only be received by site when eDiary upl oads/syncs, subject to connection availability, 
therefore participants may initiate contact with the investigator for assessment of possible 
AECOPD regardless of any prompts from the site, or the eDiary and spirometry.
The investigator then makes th  decision whether or not to initiate (or escalate, as appropriate) 
treatment for a COPD exacerbation. The investigator site is responsible for documenting the action taken for every alert, in the source notes and relevant eCRF modules, regardless who 
initiates contact (site or participant).
8.1.4 Objective Cough Monitoring
Objective cough frequency over 24 hours will be measured using an ACM (VitaloJAK™; Vitalograph, Buckinghamshire, UK), which will be fitted and worn by the participants for approximately 24 hours after the visits detailed in the SoA (Section 1.3). Set up of the cough 
monitors should be performed as th e final assessment at each visit.
The sites will receive training to ensure the ACM is correctly fi tted and activated by site staff, 
and the site staff will be given instructions to provide to the participants on how the ACM should be worn during the 24 hour period, to ensure data are recorded correctly. Advice '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

undertake cough counting for all participants using a standardized process. Details on the 
process to follow will be provided to the sites as part of the ACM training.
Detailed procedures for set up of device, recording and analyzing objective cough data will be 
described in a separate manual provided to each site. Details regarding assessment of the quality of objectiv e cough monitoring undertaken by the Vendor will also be detailed in the 
manual.
8.1.5 COPDCompEx
The COPDCompEx is a composite endpoint for exacerbations in COPD. The COPDCompEx 
combines exacerbations with events defined from participant e-Diaries and PEF. The 
definitions for both types of exacerbation are as follows:
!COPDCompEx defined exacerbations: episodes leading to one or more of the following: 
hospitalization, emergency room visit, treatment wi th OCS, or treatment with antibiotics. 
Note, this definition is not exactly the same as is used in Section 8.1.6.
!Diary events: defined by threshold and lope criteria using the following diary and home 
spirometry variables: overall symptom rating, nighttime awakenings due to symptoms, 
.
More details on the derivation and analy is of this variable will be given in the SAP.
8.1.6 COPD Exacerbations (AECOPD)
An AECOPD will be defined as a change in the subject’s usual COPD symptoms that lasts 
2 or more days, is beyond normal day-to-day variation, is acute in onset, and may warrant a 
change in regular medication. The change in symptoms must include at least one major COPD symptom and at least one other major or minor symptom from the list below:
!Major COPD symptoms: dyspnea, sput um volume, and sputum color 
!Minor COPD symptoms: cough, wheeze, sore throat, cold symptoms (rhinorrhea or nasal 
congestion), and fever without other cause.
These symptoms are captured by the eDiary (see Section 8.1.3) . If an AECOPD event is not 
associated with eDiary alert due to COPD symp toms (eg, technical issue with the eDiary), the 
investigator should interview the participant and evaluate potential worsening and duration of major and minor symptoms.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 77 of 155If symptoms are acute or have progressed rapidly and require treatment less than 2 days from 
onset of symptoms, the investigator will have to justify the decision for defining the event as an exacerbation and record it in the eCRF.
If a subject’s symptoms and the overall clinical findings support the diagnosis of a COPD 
exacerbation, but the subject has not experienced a worsening of at least one major COPD 
symptom and at least one other major or mi nor symptom (eg, rapid worsening leading to 
intubation), the investigator will have to just ify the decision for defining the event as an 
exacerbation and record it in the eCRF.
A clinical assessment of any potential exacerbation during the intervention and follow up 
periods will occur either at the next scheduled visit or, if necessary, an additional E/A visit 
prior to the next scheduled visit (see the SoA in Section 1.3).
8.1.6.1 Severity of AECOPD
An AECOPD will be classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the following criteria.
An AECOPD will be considered severe if it results in:
!An inpatient COPD-related hospitalization (documentation stating that the subject was
hospitalized for the COPD exacerbation or a record of the subject being admitted for ≥24 hours to an observation area, the emergency department, or other equivalent 
healthcare facility depending on the c ountry and healthcare system).
!COPD-related death
An AECOPD that is not considered severe will be considered moderate if it results in:
!Use of systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics for at least 3 days; a single depot
injectable dose of cortic steroids will be considered equivalent to a 3-day course ofsystemic corticosteroids
Exacerbations that are neither considered moderate or severe will be considered mild.
8.1.6.2 Duration of AECOPD
The start and stop dates of COPD exacerbations will determined as follows:
The start and stop dates of mild AECOPD will be the onset and resolution of worsened 
symptoms respectively.
The start dates of moderate and severe AECOPD will be the earliest of:
!Start date of systemic corticosteroids for AECOPD

If less than 7 days have elapsed since the end date of an AECOPD and the start date of a new 
AECOPD, the second event will be considered a relapse of the prior AECOPD in the 
statist ical analysis.
8.1.6.3 COPD Exacerbation eCRF
The investigator should record all pertinent findings and symptoms associated with the 
exacerbation event and their duration in source documents and in the COPD exacerbation eCRF. In particular, the investigator should also note any changes in medications related to 
cardiovascular function at any AECOPD event to enable cardiac event evaluation in this eCRF module.
Associated symptoms of COPD are considered as symptoms of disease under study and will
not be recorded as AEs unless considered an SAE.
All COPD related SAEs will also be recorded on the SAE eCRF.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 79 of 1558.1.8.1 Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool– Patient-reported 
Outcome (EXACT-PRO) and Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD 
(E-RS™:COPD)
The EXACT-PRO is a 14-item ePRO instrument developed to assess the frequency, severity 
and duration of COPD exacerbations (Jones et al 2011; Leidy et al 2011) . The instrument was 
developed for daily, at home, administration using a handheld electronic device. Respondents are instructed to complete the diary each evening just prior to bedtime and to answer the questions while considering their experiences “today”. The daily EXACT-PRO total score has 
a range of 0 to 100 with higher scores indicative of greater severity. Total score changes are 
used to identify the onset and recovery from  an EXACT-PRO defined exacerbation event. In 
identifying event onset and recovery, the EXACT-PRO can provide information on event frequency and duration as well as event severity.
The E-RS™:COPD is an 11-item ePRO developed to evaluate the severity of respiratory
symptoms of COPD (Leidy et al 2014a; Leidy et al 2014b) . The E-RS™:COPD is a subset of 
items from the EXACT-PRO. The E-RS™:COPD was designed to be captured as part of the daily EXACT-PRO assessment. Summation of E-RS™:COPD item responses produces a total 
score ranging from 0 to 40, with higher scores i ndicating greater severity. In addition to the 
total score, symptom domain scores can be calculated for breathlessness (5 items; score range: 0 to 17), cough and sputum (3 items; score range: 0 to 11) and chest symptoms (3 items; score range: 0 to 12) by summing the responses of items within a respective domain. As with the total score, higher domain scores indicate greater  severity. The EXACT-PRO will be captured 
daily each evening in this study via the eDiary.
8.1.8.2 Cough Visual Analogue Scale (Cough VAS)
Participants will be asked to complete a cough severity VAS (100 mm linear scale marked 
with a horizontal line by the participant , with 0 mm representing ‘‘no cough’’ and 100 mm 
representing “worst cough ) m asuring subjective assessment by the participant of the prior 
24 hrs for severity of cough symptoms (Smith et al 2006) . The cough VAS will be completed 
each evening in the eDiary.
8.1.8.3 Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS©)
The BCSS©, is a 3-item daily diary ( Leidy et al 2003)  that assesses the severity of the 
3 symptoms: breathlessness, sputum, and cough, each on a 5-point scale. Item scores can be reported as domains scores and are summed to yield a total score. Higher scores for each domain, and thus for total score, indicate more severe symptoms. The BCSS will be captured each evening via the eDiary.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 80 of 1558.1.8.5 St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)
The SGRQ is a 50-item ePRO instrument de veloped to measure the health status of 
participants with airway obstruction diseases (Jones et al 1991) . The questionnaire is divided 
into 2 parts: Part 1 consists of 8 items pertaining to the severity of respiratory symptoms in the preceding 4 weeks; Part 2 consists of 42 items related to the daily activity and psychosocial impacts of the individual’s respiratory condition. The SGRQ yields a total score and 3 domain scores (symptoms, activity, and impacts). The total score indicates the impact of disease on 
overall health status. This total score is expressed as a percentage of overall impairment, in 
which 100 represents the worst possible health status and 0 indicates the best possible health status. Likewise, the domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of greater impairment. Based on empirical data and interviews with patients, a change of 4 units is associated with a minimum clinically important difference. Specific details on the scoring algorithms are provided by the developer in a user manual (Jones and Forde 2009) . The 
SGRQ will be completed using eDiary in accordance with the SoA (Section 1.3)and a 4 week 
recall version will be used.
8.1.8.6 COPD Assessment Test (CAT)
Participants will be asked to complete a CAT at SV1. The CAT is designed to measure the 
impact of COPD on a person's life ( Jones et al 2009) . The CAT consists of eight questions that 
ask the participant to rate items relating to symptoms and impact on quality of life (such as 
normal activity and sleep). Each question is performed on a scale from 0 to 5 with 0 being the 
best possible health status or least impairment and 5 being the worst health status or greatest 
impairment. The CAT will be performed at the baseline visit (SV1) only to enable 
sub-analyses based on baseline disease activity status via the eDiary, which will be further 
described in the SAP.

This study will include as an option for part icipants to complete an anonymized questionnaire, 
‘Study Participant Feedback Questionnaire’ for participants to provide feedback on their clinical trial experience. Individual participant level responses will not be reviewed by 
investigators. Responses will be used by AstraZeneca to understand where improvements can 
be made in the clinical trial process. This questionnaire does not collect data about the participant’s disease, symptoms, study intervention effect or AEs and therefore would not be study data. The Study Participant Feedback Questionnaire will be captured electronically at time points indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3) and is subject to agreement in the ICF.
8.1.9 Chest CT
Where an inspiratory chest CT scan has been performed within 6 months of informed consent 
and can be obtained and is adequate for quantitative as essment it shall serve as the baseline 
scan. Otherwise, a CT scan will be performed, per Table 2,  to serve as the baseline scan.
In order to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure  a CT scan to serve as the baseline scan 
should only be performed if all of the following criteria are met.
!The participant has nothad an inspiratory chest CT scan within 6 months of informed 
consent, which can be obtained and is adequate for quantitative assessment, and
!The participant is believed to be eligible, at the time, according to all inclusion and 
exclusion criteria
Quantitative assessment for the extent of emphysema of the baseline scan will be performed, 
using procedures described in the Vendor manual provided to sites. 
All CT scans performed (or used) for the purposes of this study should be locally reviewed by 
a suitably qualified radiologist for clinical fi ndings outside of emphysema and morphometric 
assessment, to ensure any incidental clinically important findings are identified and referred/treated appropriately (eg, suspected cance r). (This local review may be performed 
remotely in accordance with local practices.) If a participant is found to have low-risk abnormalities (eg. nodules) that, according to local guidelines, only require surveillance where the first surveillance scan would be required after SV14 then that participant may be included '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 82 of 155at the discretion of the investigator. Participants that require earlier surveillance scans or more 
active investigation must notbe randomized, per Exclusion Criterion 9(g).
New CT scans must be performed in a standardized way:All new CT scans should be performed post-BD, ie, within 60 minutes of using up to 
4 inhalations of albuterol or salbutamol. When these are undertaken at the same visit as 
spirometry and small airway measurements, CT should be performed after these assessments, 
so as not to confound the BD withhold periods. If BD is performed as part of the spirometryassessments, this should be repeated if the BD occurred in excess of 60 minutes prior to the CT scan.
A radiology manual, as well as further training by the imaging vendor, will describe both the 
process of obtaining new scans and how to submit scans (historical and new) to the imaging vendor. An optimized CT protocol will also be provided to the sites that includes all required scan parameters.
Any clinical findings from historical CT should be recorded on the specific imaging eCRF 
page for SV1. Any findings based on the local assessment of a new CT scan performed during screening/run-in must be recorded in the corr sponding eCRF section for SV3.
All CT images submitted to the imaging vendor must first be de-identified at the site to 
remove any participant identifiers. No clinical interpretation of the CT scans will be 
performed by the central imaging vendor.

8.2 Safety Assessments
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3).
8.2.1 Medical, Surgical, and COPD History
Complete medical a nd surgical history will include history of COVID-19 and COVID-19 
vaccination if applicable, prior and current, medical conditions, past or present cardiovascular disorders, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, neurological, endocrine, lymphatic, hematologic, imm unologic, psychiatric, genit urinary, drug and surgical history, or any other 
diseases, disorders, or surgical procedures
The participant’s COPD history will also be collected including questions related to the 
participant’s COPD history, durati n of C OPD, and COPD medications (both past and 
current).
8.2.2 Physical Examinations, Weight and Height
!Complete and brief physical examinations will be performed by a licensed HCP 
(eg, physician, physician’s assistant, or licensed nurse practitioner). A complete physical 
examination will include, but will not be limited to, assessment of general appearance, 
head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, skin, as well as cardiovascular, respiratory, 
abdominal, and nervous systems. 
!A brief physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of cardiovascular, 
respiratory, and nervous systems. Each clinically significant abnormal finding will be recorded in the medical history, and each treatment emergent abnormality, including 
injection site reactions identified by assessing SC injection sites, will be recorded as an 
AE.
!Physical examinations, weight and height will be recorded at timepoints specified in the

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 84 of 1558.2.3 Vital Signs
The nominal timing of vital signs is described in the SoA (Section 1.3). The participant should 
be in a resting supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to the collection of vital signs, as 
follows: 
!Oral or tympanic temperature
!DBP
!SBP
!Heart (pulse) rate
!Respiratory rate
For the first 2 doses of study intervention, pa rticipants are to remain at the site for ≥2 hours or 
until stable, whichever is later. In addition, vital signs will be taken before and immediately after administration of study intervention, and at 30, 60, and 120 minutes (± 5 minutes) thereafter or until stable, whichever is later. For the subsequent doses of study intervention, 
participants are to remain at the site for ≥ 1 hour or until stable, whichever is later. In addition,
vital signs will be taken before and immediately after administration of study intervention, and at 30 and 60 minutes (± 5 minutes) thereafter  Following the observation period, participant discharge will be at the discretion of the investigator.
8.2.4 Electroca rdiograms
Electrocardiograms will be performed t timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3) and 
prior to vital signs, and blood sampling. El ectrocardiograms will be done as a single 
measurement. 
The nominal timing of ECGs is described in the SoA (Section 1.3). The ECG assessment 
should be performed before interventions wi th the participant (eg, spirometry and 
administration of the COPD related medications and study intervention). The participant should be in a resting supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to the collection of ECGs. At baseline, pre-dose of study intervention at SV3 (Day 1), triplicate ECGs will be performed 
(all 3 ECGs within a 5-minute time period, at least 1 minute apart). The mean value of each parameter from the triplicate will be used as th e baseline value. Electrocardiograms taken at 
all other times will be single assessments. 
Electrocardiograms will be recorded with 12-lead digital ECG devices at a speed of 
25 mm/second with amplitude recording of 10 mm/mV. Where possible the same make and model ECG device should be us ed for recording all ECGs for a particular participant. At least 
3 full complexes must be recorded. Date and time settings should be checked regularly and following time changes for daylight savings time. Skin preparation should be thorough and electrode positions should be according to standard 12-lead ECG placements.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

reviewed by the PI or a qualified designee before the participant is permitted to leave the clinic. Abnormalities and obvious changes in ECG parameters from baseline will be assessed by the principal investigator for clinical significance.
Electrocardiogram variables will be collected, as follows:
!Heart (pulse) rate
!RR interval
!QRS interval
!PR interval
!QT interval
8.2.5 Echocardiogram
A transthoracic echocardiogram to assess LVEF will be performed and reported locally (see 
the SoA in Section 1.3).
It should be performed using local guidelines and standards. All echocardiograms must assess 
left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, and LVEF by 2D examination. An accepted, objective quantitative method must be used to calculate LVEF (eg, the modified biplane Simpson’s rule). For each participant, the same quantitative method used to assess LVEF at their first echocardiogram undertaken, during the screening period, must be applied to all subsequent assessments of LVEF.
Routine examination beyond left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, and 
LVEF is not required unless clini ally indicated. However, a standard 2D echocardiogram must be performed in any parti ipant with an abnormal LVEF (< 40%), in order to identify 
potential causes of depressed left ventricular function.
8.2.6 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
The nominal timing of blood draws is described in the SoA (Section 1.3). A Laboratory
Manual will be provided to the sites that specifies the procedures for collection, processing, storage, and shipment of samples, as well as laboratory contact information, specific to this clinical research study. Clinical laboratory safety tests will be performed in a central clinical laboratory with the exception of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test which may be performed 
either locally (according to local standards) or centrally. Urine pregnancy tests may be 
performed at the site using a licensed test (dips tick). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory
results should be repeated as soon as possible (preferably within 24 to 48 hours).'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

!SARS-CoV-2 (serology and nucleic acid test)
It is recognised that frequent routine testing of asymptomatic participants for SARS-CoV-2 at 
visits SV3 onwards may be unnecessary and not  actually contribute to participant safety. In 
regions where there is no community spread  of covid infection (sporadic/imported cases or 
outbreaks only) and is expected to remain as  such, the medical monitor, at the request of the 
PI of a site, may authorise a less demanding schedule of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing from SV3 onwards at that site. This authorisation may be ended by the medical monitor, at any time, should the local epidemi logy change (or be expected to change).
8.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The PI is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the 
content of this section
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix B.
Adverse events will be reported by the pa rticipant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the participant's legally authorised representative). 
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording 
events that meet the definition of an AE.
8.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
Adverse events and SAEs will be collected by the investigator from informed consent throughout the intervention period and including the follow-up period.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by him or her, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor.
8.3.2 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs
Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant’s last AE assessment in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. AstraZeneca retains the right to request a dditional information for any participant with
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.
Adverse event variables
The following variables will be collected for each AE:
!AE (verbatim)
!The date and time when the AE started and stopped
!Severity grade 
!Whether the AE is serious or not
!Investigator causality rating against the study intervention (yes or no)
!Action taken with regard to the study intervention

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 89 of 1558.3.3 Causality Collection
The investigator should assess causal relationship between study intervention and each AE, 
and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility 
that the event may have been caused by the study intervention?’
For SAEs, causal relationship should also be assessed for other medication and study
procedures. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’.
For COVID-related events, the investigator should add ‘COVID’ as part of the verbatim term.
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix B.
8.3.4 Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question 
from the study site staff: ‘Have you had any health probl ms since the previous visit/you were 
last asked?’ or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.
8.3.5 Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests
The results from the CSP-mandat d la oratory tes ts and vital signs will be summarized in the 
CSR. 
Deterioration as compared to baseline in CSP- mandated laboratory values, spirometry values 
and vital signs s hould therefore only be reported as AEs if:
!They fulfil any of the SAE criteria, or
!Are the reason for discontinuation of tr eatment with the study  intervention, or
!Are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include 
but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were 
required or other action was taken with the study intervention, eg, dose adjustment or 
study intervention interruption).
If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clin ical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE  and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value). '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 90 of 155In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in 
non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease under study.
8.3.6 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest are events of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of MEDI3506 and may require close monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to AstraZeneca. An AESI may be serious or non-serious. The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand them in association with the use of MEDI3506.
The following AESIs will be particu larly monitored in this study:
!Hepatic function abnormality meeting the definition of HL as described in Section 8.3.7.
!Serious hypersensitivity (including Type 1 to 4 hypersensitivity reactions), for example 
anaphylaxis and severe allergic reactions  and immune complex disease.
!Injection site reactions.
!Cardiac events (including angina or myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, 
symptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease, cor pulmonale, or arrhythmia).
!Serious infections (including opportunistic infections and viral reactivations), for example 
herpes simplex virus/varicell  zoster virus, Epstein Barr virus/cytomegalovirus, TB, and 
all other opportunistic infections listed in the Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment 
of Opportunist ic Infections in HIV Infected Adults and Adolescents: Reco mmendations 
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, 
and the HIV Medicine A ociation of the Infectious Diseases Society of America 
(NIH 2019) .
!Gastrointestinal AEs
!Malignancy
8.3.7 Hy’s Law
Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further 
evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥2 × ULN may 
need to be reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix E for further instruction on cases of 
increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of HL.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 91 of 1558.3.8 Disease-Under Study
Symptoms of disease under study are those which might be expected to occur as a direct result 
of COPD. Events which are unequivocally due to disease under study should not be reported 
as an AE during the study unless they meet SAE cr iteria or lead to discontinuation of the study
intervention. 
Acute exacerbations of COPD should be reported as AEs.
8.3.9 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the study
intervention, or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform 
the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day, ie, immediately but no later than 
24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 
1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately. Investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within 1 calendar 
day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
For further guidance on the definiti n of an SAE, see Appendix B of the CSP.
The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness is the IB for MEDI3506.
8.3.10 Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca except if the 
pregnancy is discovered before the study participant has received any study intervention.
8.3.10.1 Maternal Exposure
If a participant becomes pregnant during the course of the study, study intervention should be 
discontinued immediately.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the study intervention 
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Congenital anomalies/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 93 of 1558.4 Overdose
An overdose is defined as a participant receiving a dose of study intervention in excess of that 
specified in the IB, unless otherwise specified in this CSP.
!An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
!An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study intervention occurs in the course of the study, the 
investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZen eca Pa ient Safety data entry site within 1 or 
5 calendar days for overdoses associated with an SAE (see Section 8.3.9)  and within 30 days 
for all other overdoses.
The designated sponsor representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant 
information is provided to the sponsor's Patient Safety data entry site.
8.5 Human Biological Samples
Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided in the studyspecific laboratory manual. Samples should be stored in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. For further details on Handling of Human Biological Sample see Appendix C.
Samples will be stored for a m ximum of 15 year s from the date of the issue of the CSR in 
line with consent and local requirements, after which they will be destroyed/repatriated.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 94 of 1558.5.1 Pharmacokinetics
Serum samples will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations of MEDI3506 as 
specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).
Samples may be collected at additional time poi nts during the study if warranted and agreed 
upon between the investigator and the sponsor eg, for safety reasons. The timing of sampling may be altered during the course of the study based on newly available data (eg, to obtain data closer to the time of peak or trough matrix concentrations) to ensure appropriate monitoring. 
Serum samples will be used to analyse th e PK of MEDI3506. Samples collected for analyses 
of MEDI3506 serum concentration may also be used to evaluate safety or efficacy aspects 
related to concerns arising during or after the study. Samples from participants who received placebo may be analysed at minimum selected time points to confirm no dosing with MEDI3506 took place.
Samples will be collected, labelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual.
8.5.1.1 Determination of Study Intervention Concentration
Samples for determination of study intervention concentration in serum will be assayed by 
bioanalytical test sites operated by or on behalf of AstraZeneca, using an appropriatelyvalidated bioanalytical method. Full details of the analytical method used will be described in 
a separate bioanalytical report.
Study intervention concentration information th at may unblind the study will not be reported 
to investigative sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded.
Incurred sample reproducibility analysis, if any, w ill be performed alongside the bioanalysis 
of the test samples. The results from the evaluation, if performed, will be reported in a separate Bioanalytical Report.
8.5.2 Immunogenicity Assessments
Blood samples for determination of ADA in serum will be assayed by bioanalytical test sites 
operated by, or on behalf of, AstraZeneca, using an appropriately validated bioanalyticalmethod. Tiered analyses will be performed to include screening, confirmatory, and titer assaycomponents. Full details of the methods used will be described in a separate report.
Anti-drug antibody samples may also be further tested for characterization of the ADA 
response, including possible assessment of neutralising antibody. No ADA samples will be collected after follow up period, ex cept if considered necessary by the sponsor in the event of 
a potentially relevant adverse event in an individual patient.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 97 of 1559 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
9.1 Statistical Hypotheses
The primary efficacy endpoint is th e Change from Baseline in pre-BD FEV 1at Week 12. A 
treatment policy estimand will be applied wh ereby all available data are included in the 
analysis, irrespective of whether a participant remains on study intervention or not.  
The null hypothesis is that the change from baseline in FEV 1at Week 12 on MEDI3506 is 
equal to the change from baseline in FEV 1at Week 12 on placebo. The alternative hypothesis 
is that the change from baseline in FEV 1at Week 12 on MEDI3506 is greater than the change 
from baseline in FEV 1at Week 12 on placebo, ie:
H0: Change from Baseline in FEV 1at Week 12 (MEDI3506-placebo) = 0.
H1: Change from Baseline in FEV 1at Week 12 (MEDI3506-placebo) > 0. 
Hypothesis testing will be performed at the one-sid ed 10% level. If the p-value is < 0.1, reject 
H0and accept H 1.
The primary analysis will act as a gate-keeper for hypothesis testing of secondary endpoints. 
Should the primary analysis hypothesis H 0be rejected, then multiplicity will be controlled for 
a subset of key secondary endpoints using Hochberg procedure. Details will be described in the SAP. 
9.2 Sample Size Determination
A sample size of 140 participants (70 participants per arm) will provide 80% power to detect a difference in mean change from baseline in FEV
1at Week 12 of 90 mL (assumed standard 
deviation of 250 mL) between the two randomized groups at a one-sided 10% level of statist ical signif icance. To allow for 2% of participants being ineligible for the primary
analysis, approximately 144 participants will be randomized in the study (72 per arm).'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 98 of 1559.3 Populations for Analyses
The following populations are defined:
Table 9 Populations for Analysis
Population Description
ITT population Participants who are randomized and receive any study intervention. Participants 
will be analyzed according to their randomized study intervention group.
As-treated population Participants who are randomized and receive any study intervention. Participants 
will be analyzed according to the study intervention they actually receive.
PK population Participants who received at least one dose of MEDI3506 and had at least one 
detectable serum concentration measurement post first dose of study intervention. Participants will be analyzed according to the study intervention they actually receive.
ITT = Intention-to-treat; PK = Pharmacokinetics.
The ITT population will be used to summari ze all demographic and baseline characteristics, 
concomitant medications, and efficacy measures. The As-treated population will be used to summarize all safety measures (AEs, laboratory tests, ECG, and vital signs). The PK population will be  used to summarize PK measures.
9.4 Statistical Analyses
All personnel involved with the analysis of  the study will remain blinded until primary 
database lock and CSP deviations dentified. Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives. A comprehensive SAP will be developed and finalized before database 
lock and will describe the part cipant populations to be included in the analyses, and 
procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyse s of the primary and secondary endpoints. Any deviations 
from this plan will be reported in the CSR.
9.4.1 General Considerations
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the ITT population.
The primary estimand is a ‘Treatment Policy’ estimand, as follows: The difference in mean 
change from baseline in FEV 1at Week 12 (MEDI3506 – placebo) will be estimated using a 
repeated measures mixed effects analysis of covariance model, for the ITT population. This will include all available data from all visits up to and including Week 12, irrespective of whether the participant discontinued study intervention or received reliever therapy.
Demography and baseline characteristics will be summarized by study intervention group for 
the ITT population.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

9.4.2.1 Primary Endpoints
The difference in mean change from baseline in FEV 1at Week 12 (MEDI3506–placebo) will 
be estimated using a repeated measures mixed effects analysis of covariance model, for the 
ITT population. The model will include all available data from all visits up to and including 
Week 12, irrespective of whether the participant discontinued study intervention. Since a repeated measures model is being applied, no imputation will be made for missing data. The model will include fixed effects for baseline, eosinophil strata, background medication strata, visit, study intervention and the baseline by visit and study intervention by visit interactions. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to describe the correlations between observations on a participant between visits. Estimates of the least square mean change from baseline in FEV
1for each study intervention, and the difference between them, together with 
80% CI, will be obtained from the model for each visit. The significance of the study 
intervention effect will be tested at a 10% one-sided level of significance as described in 
Section 9.1.
Additionally, the difference in mean change from baseline in FEV 1at each study visit will be 
analyzed using a repeated measures mixed effects analysis of covariance model as described above, including all available data from all visits through to Week 28.
9.4.2.2 Secondary Endpoints 
Time to first COPDCompEx event will be analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model, 
with study intervention, eosinophil strata and background medication strata fitted as covariates. The data will also be displayed in  a Kaplan-Meier plot. The COPDCompEx event 
rate will be analyzed using negative binomial regression, with the l og(follow up time) 
included as an offset term. The dependent variable will be the number of COPDCompEx events through end of intervention, and the model will include study intervention group, eosinophil strata and background medication strata as fixed effects. 
Subgroup Analyses:
Subgroup analyses may be performed. These will be described in the SAP, including a 
subgroup analysis of extent of emphysema on mean change from baseline in lung function at Week 28.
9.4.2.3 Exploratory Endpoints
9.4.3 Safety
The occurrence of treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs will be described by system organ class, 
preferred term, severity, and relationship to the study intervention. Participants will be '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

9.4.4.4 Additional Analyses
The incidence rate of positive antibodies to MEDI3506 will be reported by study intervention 
group. If there is a high incidence of ADA, th  association of ADA with MEDI3506 concentration will be assessed. In addition  the relationship between ADA and PD, efficacy, and safety may be evaluated. MEDI3506 serum concentrations will be tabulated along with
descriptive statistics. Mean and individual serum MEDI3506 concentration-time profiles will be plotted. Population PK modeling may be pe rformed if data allow. The potential correlation 
between PK exposure and PD biomarkers, and efficacy/safety response may be evaluated.
9.5 Interim Analyses 
The study team may decide to conduct an administrative un-blinded analysis of the study, 
prior to the Primary Analysis, with the intent to trigger internal (AstraZeneca) investmentdecisions. The purpose of this interim analysis would be to inform decisions on future development options for MEDI3506 or other programs. No termination of this study, or adjustments to the study design are planned. Regardless of any interim analysis results, this study will be continued and completed. As a result, no alpha will be spent at the interim 
analysis. Additional details on the unblinding for interim analysis are provided in 
Section 6.3.3.1.
Details of any interim analyses, if conducted, will be included in the Interim Analysis Plan.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

Evaluating, Follow-up, and Reporting
Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical 
study participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurrence.  An AE may occur at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study intervention has been administered.
Definitions of Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study  phase (ie, run-in, intervention, washout, 
follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following riteria:
!Results in death
!Is immediately life-threatening
!Requires in-participant hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation 
!Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
!Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
!Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the participant or may require medical 
treatment to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Adverse Events for malignant tumours reported during a st udy should gener ally be assessed 
as Serious AEs. If no other seriousness criteria apply, the ‘Important Medical Event’ criterion 
should be used. In certain situations, however, medical judgement on an individual event basis should be applied to clarify that the malignant  tumour event should be assessed and reported 
as a Non-Serious AE. For example, if the tumour is included as medical history and 
progression occurs during the study, but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the malignant tumour, the AE may not  fulfil the attributes for being assessed as 
Serious, although reporting of the progression of the malignant tumour as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, some types of malignant tumours, which do not spread remotely after a 
routine treatment that doe s not require hospitalization, may be assessed as Non-Serious; 
examples in adults include Stage 1 basal cell carcinoma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer 
removed via cone biopsy.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 110 of 155Life Threatening
‘Life-threatening’ means that the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
participant’s death. ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospitalisation
Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not  considered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the participant was enrolled in th e study, provided that it did not deteriorate in 
an unexpected way during the study.
Important Medical Event or Medical Treatment
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospitalisation, disability or incapacity but may jeopardise the participant or may require medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious. 
These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.
!Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatment
!Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
!Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
!Blood dyscrasias  (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convulsions that do not re sult in hospitalisation
!Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Severity Rating Scale:
The determination of severi ty should be made by the investigator based upon medical 
judgment and the severity categories of Grade 1 to 5 (based on the CTCAE criteria; 
NCI 2017)  as defined below:
Grade 1 An event of mild intensity that is usually transient and may require only 
minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 111 of 155Grade 2 An event of moderate intensity that is usually alleviated with additional 
specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the participant.
Grade 3 A severe event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the clinical status of the 
participant.
Grade 4 An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with an imminent 
risk of death.
Grade 5 Death as a result of an event.It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix B2 . An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Appendix B2 . On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix B2 .
A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causali y consider the following factors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reasonable possibility’ that an AE may have been caused by the study intervention.
!Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the participant actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug?
!Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology a nd toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties?
!De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose 
of the suspect drug?
!No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology such 
as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
!Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-
challenge.
!Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 112 of 155In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
!Is this a recognised feature of overdose of the drug?
!Is there a known mechanism?
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is  meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.
The causality assessment is  performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment. With no available facts or arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship, the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relationship in cases where the diseas e under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.
Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study, a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study intervention that either causes harm to the 
participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant. 
A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the study intervention, but rather a human or 
process related failure while the study intervention is in control of the study site staff or participant.
Medication error includes situ ations where an error: 
!occurred
!was identified and intercepted before the participant received the study intervention
!did not occur, but circumstances were recognised that could have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
!Study intervention name confusion
!Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly , even if it was not actually given to 
the participant
!Study intervention not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site 
of administration
!Study intervention not taken as indicated eg, tablet dissolved in water when it should be 
taken as a solid tablet '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

of the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error 
!Participant accidentally missed study intervent ion dose(s) eg, forgot to take medication
!Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
!Participant failed to return unused medication or empty packaging

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 114 of 155Appendix C Handling of Human Biological Samples
Chain of Custody
A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.
The investigator at each centre keep s full traceability of collected biologi cal samples from the 
participants while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and records relevant processing information related to the samples whilst at site.
The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps record of receipt of arrival and onward 
shipment or disposal.
AstraZeneca or delegated representatives will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through 
internal procedures, monitoring of study sites , auditing or process checks, and contractual 
requirements of extern al laboratory  providers
Samples retained for further use will be stored in the AstraZeneca-assigned biobanks or other 
sample archive facilit ies and will be tracked by the a ppropriate AstraZeneca Team during for 
the remainder of the sample life cycle.
If required, AstraZeneca will ensure that remaining biological samples are returned to the site 
according to local regulations or at the end of the retention period, whichever is the sooner.
Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples 
If a participant withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will 
be disposed of/destroyed/repatriated, and the action documented. If samples are alreadyanalyzed, AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the results of this research.
Following withdrawal of consent for biological samples, further study participation should be 
considered in relation to the withdrawal processes outlined in the informed consent.
The investigator:
!Ensures participant’s withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
highlighted immediately to AstraZeneca or delegate.
!Ensures that relevant human biological samples  from that participant, if stored at the 
study site, are immediately identified, di sposed of as appropriate, and the action 
documented
!Ensures that the participant and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

LABELLING AND SHIPMENT OF BIOHAZARD SAMPLES
International Airline Transportation Association 
(https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dgr/Pages/download.aspx ) classifies infectious 
substances into 3 categories: Category A, Category B or Exempt
Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disa bility, life-threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healthy humans or animals. Category A pathogens are e.g., Ebola, Lassa fever virus. Infectious substances meeting these 
criteria which cause disease in humans or both in humans and animals must be assigned to UN 2814. Infectious substances which cause disease only in animals must be assigned to UN 2900:
Category B Infectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A. Category B pathogens are eg, Hepatitis A, C, D, and E viruses. Theyare assigned the following UN number and proper shipping name
!UN 3373 – Biological Substa ce, Category B
!are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650
Exempt - Substances which do not contain infectious substances or substances which are 
unlikely to cause disease in humans or animals are not subject to these Regulations unless theymeet the criteria for inclusion in another class.
!Clinical study samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regulations
!Clinical study samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient temperature in 
IATA 650 compliant packaging

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 119 of 155Appendix E Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver Biochemistry 
and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be followed in order to identify and appropriately 
report PHL cases and HL cases. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. 
Specific guidance on managing liver abnormalities can be found in Section 8.3.7 of the CSP.
During the course of the study the investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry. The investigator is responsible for determining whether a participant meets PHL 
criteria at any point during the study.
All sources of laboratory data are appropriate for the determination of PHL and HL events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study vi sits and other visits including central and all 
local laboratory evaluations even if collected out side of the study visits; for example, PHL 
criteria could be met by an elevated ALT from a central laboratory and/or elevated TBL from 
a local laboratory. 
The investigator will also review AE data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations 
in liver biochemistry) for possible PHL events.
The investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether HL criteria are met. Hy’s law criteria are met if there is no alternative  explanation for the elevations in liver 
biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury caused by the IMP. 
The investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting SAEs and AEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.
Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate aminotransferase or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN at any point
during the study following the start of study medication irrespective of an increase in ALP.
Hy’s Law (HL)
Aspartate aminotransferase or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN, where no 
other reason, other than the IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug. '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 120 of 155For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to identify cases of PHL it is importan t to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory data for any participant who meets any of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination:
!ALT ≥ 3 × ULN
!AST ≥ 3 × ULN
!TBL ≥ 2 × ULN
Central Laboratories Being Used:
When a participant meets any of the PHL identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, 
the central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the investigator (also sent to 
AstraZeneca representative). 
The investigator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the PHL 
identification criteria are met, where this is the case the investigator will:
!Notify the AstraZeneca representa ive
!Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by the central laboratory without delay.
When the identification criteria are met from cen tral or local laboratory results the investigator 
will wit hout delay:
!Determine whether the participant meets PHL criteria (see Section E2for definition) by 
reviewing laboratory reports from all previous visits (including both central and locallaboratory results)
Local Laboratories Being Used:
The investigator will without delay review each  new laboratory report and if the identif ication 
criteria are met will:
!Notify the AstraZeneca representative
!Determine whether the participant meets PHL criteria (see Appendix E2Definitions 
within this Appendix for definition) by reviewing laboratory reports from all previous 
visits
!Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory eCRF'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

Follow-up
E 4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Not Met
If the participant does not meet PHL criteria the investigator will:
!Inform the AstraZeneca represent ative that the participant has not met PHL criteria.
!Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance provided in 
the CSP.
E 4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met
If the participant does meet PHL criteria the investigator will:
!Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any study visit prior to starting study
intervention
Notify the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform th e central Study Team
!Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the investigator will report the case as an SAE of 
PHL; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and causality assessment ‘yes/related’ 
according to CSP process for SAE reporting
!For participants that met PHL criteria pri r to starting IMP, the investigator is not 
required to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change #in the participant’s 
condition
!The AstraZeneca Study Physician contacts the investigator, to provide guidance, discuss 
and agree an approach for the study participants’ follow-up (including any further 
laboratory testing) and the continuous review of data
!Subsequent to this contact the investigator will:
∀Monitor the parti ipant until liver bi ochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. Completes follow-up SAE Form as required.
∀Investigate the aetiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as 
discussed with the AstraZeneca Study Physician.
∀Complete the three Liver eCRF Modules as information becomes available 
A ‘significant’ change in the participant’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in 
any of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the investigator, this may be in consultation with the AstraZeneca Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, the AstraZeneca 
Study Physician contacts the investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria othe r than drug induced 
liver injury caused by the IMP, to ensure timely  analysis and reporting to health authorities 
within 15 calendar days from date PHL criteria was met. The AstraZeneca Global Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global Safety Physician will also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate. 
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the investigator will follow the 
instructions below.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, 
a determination of whether the alternative e xplanation is an AE will be made and 
subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for an SAE:
If the alternative explanation is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate eCRF
If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted PHL SAE and 
AE eCRFs accordingly with the new information (reassessing event term; causality and seriousness criteria) following the AstraZeneca standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
!Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard 
processes. 
∀The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion s hould be used if no other serious criteria 
apply
∀As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a cau sality asse ssment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 15 calendar days in obtaining the information 
necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:
!Provides any further update to the previously submitted SAE of PHL, (report term now 
‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causality assessment is related to IMP and seriousness criteria 
is medically importan t, according to CSP process for SAE reporting.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

Women are considered to be of childbearing potential unless they meet either of the criteria, 
as follows:
!Surgically sterilized (including bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or
!hysterectomy), or
!Post-menopausal.
For women aged < 50 years, post-me nopausal is defined as having both:
!A history of ≥ 12 months amenorrhea, without an alternative cause, following cessation of
!exogenous sex-hormonal treatment and,
!A follicle-stimulating hormone level in the post-menopausal range.
For women aged ≥ 50 years, post-menopausal is defined as having a history of ≥ 12 months 
amenorrhea, without an alternative cause, following ces ation of exogenous se x-hormonal
treatment.
A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure rate 
(ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. The acceptable methods of contraception are described in Table 10 below.
Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and withdrawal are NOT acceptable methods of 
contraception.
Table 10 Highly Effective Methods of Contraception
Barrier Methods Hormonal Methods
• Intrauterine device
• Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) a
• Bilateral tubal occlusion
• Vasectomized partner b
• Sexual abstinence c Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing 
hormonal contraception)
• Oral (combined pill)
• Injectable• Transdermal (patch)• Progestogen-only hormonal contraception• Desogestrel
aThis is also considered a hormonal method.
bWith appropriate post-vasectomy medical testing of surgical success (ie, absence of sperm in ejaculate).
cSexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of the study and if it is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
participant.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network Guidance for Anaphylaxis Diagnosis
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis 
Network define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death (Sampson et al 2006) . They recognize 3 categories of anaphylaxis, with criteria 
designated to capture from 80% of cases (Category 1) to > 95% of all cases of anaphylaxis (for all 3 categories). 
1 Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) AND AT LEAST 1 OF THE FOLLOWING:
(a) Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia).
(b) Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence).
2 Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that 
participant (minutes to several hours):
(a) Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula).
(b) Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, 
hypoxemia).
(c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)
(d) Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting).
3 Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that participant (minutes to several 
hours):
(a) Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mmHg or greater than 30% decrease from that 
person’s baseline.
For the purpose of AE reporting, the above criteria should be used to guide retrospective 
judgment as to whether an event was true anaphylaxis. Guidance on the recognition of possible anaphylaxis at the time of the event is provided (Appendix I) .'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 130 of 155Appendix I Signs and Symptoms and Management of Acute Anaphylaxis
Appropriate drugs, such as epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids, etc, and medical
equipment to treat anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available at study sites, and 
study personnel should be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. Local or national guidelines for the recognition and management of acute anaphylaxis should be followed where available. Where not available, guidance is provided below.
Signs and Symptoms of Acute Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is an acute and potentially lethal mult i-system allergic reaction in which some or 
all of the following signs and symptoms occur:
!Diffuse erythema.
!Pruritus.
!Urticaria and/or angioedema.
!Bronchospasm.
!Laryngeal edema.
!Hypotension.
!Cardiac arrhythmias.
!Feeling of impending doom.

Management of Acute Anaphylaxis
I 2.1 Immediate Intervention
1 Assessment of airway, breathing, circul ation, and adequ acy of mentation.
2 Administer epinephrine intramuscularly every 5 to 15 minutes, in appropriate doses, as 
necessary, depending on the presenting signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, to control signs and symptoms and prevent progression to more severe symptoms such as respiratory distress, hypotension, shock and unconsciousness.
I 2.2
Possibly Appropriate, Subsequent Measures Depending on Response to 
Epinephrine
1 Place participant in recumbent pos ition and elevate lower extremities.
2 Establish and maintain airway.
3 Administer oxygen.
4 Establish venous access.5 Normal saline IV for fluid replacement.
I 2.3
Specific Measures to Consider after Epinephrine Injections, Where 
Appropriate
1 Consider epinephrine infusion.
2 Consider H1 and H2 antihistamines
3 Consider nebulized beta-2 ag nist [eg, albuterol (salbutamol)] for bronchospasm resistant 
to epinephrine.
4 Consider systemic corticosteroids.
5 Consider vasopressor (eg, dopamine).
6 Consider glucagon for participant taking b-blocker.
7 Consider atropine for symptomatic bradycardia.
8 Consider transportation to an emergency department or an intensive care facility.9 For cardiopulmonary arrest during anaphylaxis, high-dose epinephrine and prolonged 
resuscitation efforts are encouraged, if necessary.
If a suspected anaphylactic reaction occurs during or within a 24-hour period after 
administration of study intervention, blood samples for serum tryptase should be collected as soon as possible after the event, at 60 ± 30 minutes after the event, at discharge, and between 2 and 4 weeks post discharge. Immediate care of the participant and treatment of the reaction must take priority over collecting blood samples.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 134 of 155Appendix K Changes Related to Mitigation of Study Disruptions Due to 
Cases of Civil Crisis, Natural Disaster, or Public Health Crisis
Note: Changes below should be implemented only during study disruptions due to any of or a 
combination of civil crisis, natural disaster, or public health crisis (eg, during quarantines and 
resulting site closures, regional travel restrictions and considerations if site personnel or studyparticipants become infected with SARS-CoV-2 or similar pandemic infection) during which participants may not wish to or may be unable to visit the study site for study visits. These changes should only be implemented if allowable by local/regional guidelines and following notification from the Sponsor, and instructions on how to perform these procedures will be provided at the time of implementation.
Reconsent of Study Participants During Study Interruptions
During study interruptions, it may not be possi ble for the participants to complete study visits 
and assessments on site and alternative means for carrying out the visits and assessments may be necessary, eg, remote visits. Reconsent s hould be obtained for the alternative means of 
carrying out visits and assessments and should be obtained prior to performing the procedures 
described in Sections K2toK6 . Local and regional regulations and/or guidelines regarding 
reconsent of study participants should be checked  and followed. Reconsent may be verbal if 
allowed by local and regional guidelines (note, in  the case of verbal reconsent the ICF should 
be signed at the participant’s next contact with the study site). Visiting the study sites for the sole purpose of obtaining reconsent should be avoided.
Rescreening of Participants To Reconfirm Study Eligibility
Additional rescreening for screen failure due to study disruption can be performed in 
previously screened participants  The investigator should confirm this with the designated 
AstraZeneca Study Physician.
In addition, during study disruption there may be a delay between confirming eligibility of a 
participant and either enrolment into the study or commencing of dosing with IP. If this delay is outside the screening window specified in the SoA (see Section 1.3) the participant will 
need to be rescreened to reconfirm eligibility before commencing study procedures. This will provide a nother opportunity to re-screen a participant in addition to that detailed in 
Section 5.4.The procedures detailed in Section 5.1must be undertaken to confirm eligibility 
using the same randomization number as for the participant.'&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

Home or Remote Visit to Replace On-site Visit (where applicable)
A qualified HCP from the study site or TPV servi ce will visit the participants home / or other 
remote location as per local SOPs, as applicable. Supplies will be provided for a safe and 
efficient visit. The qualified HCP will be expected to collect information per the CSP.
Telemedicine Visit to Replace On-site Visit (where applicable)
In this appendix, the term telemedicine visit refers to remote contact with the participants
using telecommunications technology including phone calls, virtual or video visits, and 
mobile health devices.
During a civil crisis, natural disaster, or public health crisis, on-site visits may be replaced by 
a telemedicine visit if allowed by local/regional guidelines. Having a telemedicine contact with the participants will allow AEs, concomitant medication, and adherence to the eDiary and ePRO measures to be reported and documented.
At-home or Remote Location IP Administration Instructions
If a site visit is not possible, at-home or remote location administration of IP may be 
performed by a qualified HCP, provided this is  acceptable within local regulation/guidance, or 
by the participant or his/her caregiver. The option of at-home or remote location IP administration ensures participants safety in cas es of a pandemic where participants may be at 
increased risk by traveling to the site/clinic. This will also minimize interruption of IP administration during other study disruptions, eg, site closures due to natural disaster. 
Section  K 5.1 to be used only when applicable for the IP formulation being used, eg, with 
injectable biologics. 
K 5.1
At-home or Rem te Location IP Administration by a Qualified HCP or 
TPV Service
A qualified HCP from the study site or TPV service should administer the IP at the 
participant’s home or other remote location according to the CSP. All necessary supplies and 
instructions for administration and documentati on of IP administrati on will be provided. 
Additional information related to the visit can be obtained via a telemedicine or home visit.
K 5.2 At-home or Remote Location IP Administration by the Participant or 
His/Her Caregiver
Prior to at-home or remote location IP administration the investigator must assess the 
participant or his/her caregiver to deter mine whether they are appropriate for at-home or 
remote location administration of IP. Once the par ticipant or his/her caregiver is deemed 
appropriate for at-home or remote location administration, he/she must receive appropriate training. All necessary supplies and instructions for administration and documentation of IP '&3URWRFRO$PHQGPHQW_9970)_

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 141 of 155Appendix M Protocol Amendment History
The Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes Table for the current amendment is located 
directly before the Table of Contents.
Amendment 4 (23 July 2021)
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union because it either significantly impacts the safety or physical/mental integrity of participants or 
the scientific value of the study.
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:
To reflect emerging evidence supporting coexistence of significan t mucus hypersecr etion in all 
extents of emphysema , to adjust for the impact of COVID-19 on exacerbation frequency globally, 
and to clarify wording on various points.

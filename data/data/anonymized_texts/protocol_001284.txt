Title of Study: 
Prospective, open- label, uncontrolled, Phase III study to assess the efficacy and safety of 
Octafibrin for on- demand treatment of acute bleeding and to prevent bleeding during and 
after surgery in subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency  
Indication: Congenital fibrinogen deficiency  
Number of Study Centres: Approximately 15 study centres worldwide.  
Study Duration: 4th quarter 2014 to 4th quarter 2019 Development Phase: III  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of Octafibrin for on -demand treatment of acute bleeding 
episodes (spontaneous or after  trauma).  
Secondary:  
• To show an association between the overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy 
and the surrogate endpoint ‘clot s trength’ or ‘clot firmness’ (referred to as ‘maximum 
clot firmness’ [MCF] in this protocol) that was used as a surrogate endpoint for haemostatic efficacy and determined via thromboelastography (TEG) in the pivotal pharmacokinetic (PK) study FORMA -01. Ther efore, MCF as surrogate efficacy 
parameter will be determined before first infusion and 1 hour after end of first and last infusion.  
• To achieve a peak target plasma fibrinogen level of 100 mg/dL in minor bleeds  and 
150 mg/dL for major bleeds 1 hour  post-infusion.  
• To determine the response to Octafibrin based on incremental in vivo recovery (IVR).  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of Octafibri n in preventing bleeding during and after 
surgery.  
• To assess the safety of Octafibrin in subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency, 
including immunogenicity, thromboembolic complications, and early signs of allergic  or 
hypersensitivity reactions.

Test Product, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s):  
In this study, Octafibrin will be administered as intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection. 
Continuous infusion is not allowed. 
 
Octafibrin Dose Calculation  
Octafibrin will be individually dosed to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level dependent on the type of bleeding or surgery (minor or major). The dose will be 
calculated individually as follows : 
*The median response in this dose calculation formula is the median incremental in vivo recovery reported in the 
interim analysis of study FORMA -01. 
**The measured level for the first infusion will be the historical level for that patient after a washout or, if below 
the limit of detection of the local assay, zero (0) will be  used.  
 
Dosing for On -Demand Treatment of  Bleeding  
For each bleeding episode that is treated as part of the study, each subject will receive at 
least 1 infusion of Octafibrin for the treatment of a major or minor acute bleeding episode 
on Day 1. 
Octafibrin will be individually dosed to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level dependent on the bleeding type (minor or major).  
• Minor bleeding will be treated to achieve a recommen ded target fibrinogen plasma 
level of 100 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 80 mg/dL.  
• Major bleeding will be treated to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma level of 150 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 130 mg/dL. 
On subsequent study days, fibrinogen plasma levels will be measured daily to determine whether additional infusions of Octafibrin are needed:  
• Minor bleeding will be observed for at least 3  days.  
• Major bleeding will be observed for at least 7  days. 
Addition al Octafibrin infusions, as required  
• Additional infusions of Octafibrin should be administered if the actual fibrinogen 
plasma level measured on subsequent study days is below the accepted lower limit of 
the target level (80 mg/dL for minor bleeding, 130 mg/dL for major bleeding). 
• If the actual fibrinogen plasma level is above the accepted lower limit of the target level,  
Octafibrin should not be administered.

Definition of minor and major bleeding  
• Minor bleeding events are defined as mild haemarthrosis or superficial muscle, soft 
tissue, and oral  bleeding.  
• Major bleeding events are defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, 
such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular, or pericardial bleeding, or intramuscular bleeding with compartment syndrome, or bleeding causing a decrease in haemoglobin level by 20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L) or  more.  
Characterisation of any other bleeding events not within these categories will be discussed individually with the investigator.  
 
Dosing for Surgery 
For each surgery that is treated as part of the study, within 3 hours prior to surgery, each 
subject will receive a loading infusion of Octafibrin.  
Octafibrin will be individually dosed to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level dependent on the surgery type (minor or major).  
• Patients undergoing minor surgery will be treated to achieve a recommended target 
fibrinogen plasma level of 100 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 80  mg/dL.  
• Patients undergoing major surgery will be treated to achieve a recommended target 
fibrinogen plasma level of 150 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 130 mg/dL.  
On each post -operative day, fibrinogen plasma levels will be  measured daily to determine 
whether maintenance infusions of Octafibrin are needed:  
• Minor surgery will be observed for at least 3 post -operative  days. 
• Major surgery will be observed for at least 7 post -operative  days. 
Maintenance infusions, as required:  
• Additional infusions of Octafibrin should be administered if the actual fibrinogen 
plasma level measured on subsequent study days is below the accepted lower limit of 
the target level (80 mg/dL for minor surgery, 130 mg/dL for major bleeding). 
• If the actual  fibrinogen plasma level is above the accepted lower limit of the target  level,  
Octafibrin should not be administered.

Definition of minor and major surgery  
Surgeries are defined as major , if any of the following criteria are met:  
• Requiring general or spinal  anaesthesia.  
• Requiring opening into the great body cavities.  
• In the course of which hazards of severe haemorrhage is  possible.  
• Requiring haemostatic therapy for at least 6  days. 
• Orthopaedic interventions involving joints (ankle, knee, hip, wrist, elbow, shoulder).  
• 3rd molar extraction or extraction of > 3 teeth.  
• Surgeries/conditions in which the subject's life is at stake.  
Characterisation of any other surgery not within these categories and considered major by 
the investigator will be discussed individually with the investigator.  
All other surgeries are classified as minor. The classification is made prospectively.  
 
Duratio n of Treatment:  
Planned duration over the entire study: The planned study duration is up to 5 years. The 
study will be considered completed when a minimum of 24 subjects have at least one documented bleeding episode.  
Planned duration for an individual subj ect: 
For subjects receiving on -demand treatment,  
• The individual subject observation and follow -up period for each documented 
episode starts with the first dose of Octafibrin administered for on -demand treatment of 
an acute bleeding episode (Day 1) and will be followed for up to Day 30. 
• Each subject’s treatment observation period is defined according to the severity of the 
event and will last at least 3 days for minor and 7 days for major bleeding  episodes.  
For subjects undergoing surgical prophylaxis,  
• the surgical observation period starts with the first dose of Octafibrin administered 
prior to elective surgery (Day 1) and, depending on the severity of the event, will last at 
least 3 post -operative days for minor and 7 post -operative days for major surgeries or 
until the day of the last post- operative infusion, whichever comes  last. 
During the study observation period, enrolled patients will be treated for any bleeding epi - 
sodes or planned surgeries that can be managed under the protocol. Patients may remain in the study until the 24th patient has at least one documented bleeding epi sode.  
As many bleeding episodes or surgeries as possible occurring throughout the study obser - 
vation period will be documented. Only the first bleeding episodes will be used for the analysis of the primary endpoint. All bleeding episodes documented in the  study will be

Patients who are screened for the study but do not present with a bleeding episode or 
planned surgery during the study observation period will be considered ’no treatment’ 
patients and reported separately.  
Reference Therapy, Dose, Mode of Administration, and Batch Number(s):  
Not applicable.  
Study Outcome Parameters (Primary and Secondary Endpoints):  
 
Efficacy:  
Primary endpoint:  
The primary endpoint is the overall clinical assessment of the haemostatic effic acy of 
Octafibrin in treating the first documented bleeding episode of each patient. The first 
bleeding episode covers the time period from the first Octafibrin infusion until 24 hours 
(i.e., 1 day) after the last infusion or the end of the treatment obser vation period, whichever 
comes last. 
The investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for bleeding will be 
based on a 4- point haemostatic efficacy scale (see table below). The final efficacy 
assessment of each patient will be adjudicated by the Independent Data Monitorin g & 
Endpoint Adjudication Committee (IDMEAC). The number of subjects per outcome 
category will be assessed in the final analysis.  
 
4-point haemostatic efficacy scale  
 
 
Category  Definition 
 
Excellent  Immediate and complete cessation of bleeding in the absence of other 
haemostatic intervention as clinically assessed by the treating physician; 
and/or <10% drop in haemoglobin compared to pre-infusion.

Secondary endpoints:  
• MCF assessment before first infusion and 1 hour after end of first and last infusion of 
each documented bleeding episode.  
• Fibrinogen plasma level before and 1 hour after the end of each infusion as well as at the 
time of the overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy (i.e., 24 hours after the last infusion of each documented bleeding episode).  
• Response as indicated by incremental IVR, calculated as the maximum increase in 
plasma fibrinogen (Clauss data) between pre- infusion and 1 and 3 hours  post-infusion.  
• Efficacy of Octafibrin in all bleeding episodes collected in the study using the 
investiga tor’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for bleeding based on a 
4-point haemostatic efficacy  scale.  
• Efficacy of Octafibrin in surgical prophylaxis will be assessed at the end of surgery by 
the surgeon and post -operatively by the haematologist using the following  scales:  
 
Category  Definition 
 Excellent Intra -operative blood loss* was lower than or equal to the average expected  
blood loss for the type of procedure performed in a subject with normal 
haemostasis and of the same sex, age, and stature.  
Good  Intra -operative blood loss* was higher than average expected blood loss but 
lower or equal to the maximal expected blood loss for the type of procedure in 
a subject with normal  haemostasis.  
Moderate  Intra -operative blood loss* was higher than maximal expected blood loss for   
the type of procedure performed in a subject with normal haemostasis, but haemostasis was controlled.  
None Haemostasis was uncontrolled necessitating a change in clotting factor 
replacement  regimen.  
 
*All excludes unexpected blood loss due to surgical complications, i.e.,  
–Direct injury of a vessel (artery or vein)  
–Vessel injury not adequately responding to routine  surgical procedures achieving haemostasis  
–Accidental injury of parenchymatous tissue (e.g., liver, lung)  
Excellent No post -operative bleeding or oozing that was not due to complications of  
surgery. All post -operative bleeding (due to complications of surgery) was 
controlled with Octafibrin as anticipated for the type of procedure.  
Good  No post -operative bleeding or oozing that was not due to complications of 
surgery. Control of post -operative bleeding due to complications of surgery 
required increased dosing with Octafibrin or additional infusions,  not 
  originally anticipated for the ty pe of  procedure.   Intra -operative efficacy as assessed by surgeon (at the end of the surgery=after last suture)

An overall efficacy assessment taking both the intra - and post -operative assessment into 
account will be adjudicated by the IDMEAC. In the event that any intra - or post - 
operative endpoint data differ between the investigator’s assessment and the adjudicat ed 
assessment by the IDMEAC, the endpoint will be that based on the adjudicated 
assessments based on an agreed algorithm.  
The surgical observation period starts with the first dose of Octafibrin administered 
prior to elective surgery (Day 1) and, depending on the severity of the event, will last at least 3 post -operative days for minor and 7 post -operative days for major surgeries or 
until the day of the last post- operative infusion, whichever com es last.  
In addition, the location, severity and type of surgery will be documented. Expected and actual duration of surgical procedure and details of administered dose(s) of Octafibrin (pre-, intra - and/or post -operatively) will be recorded. Fibrinogen pl asma levels (pre- , 
intra-, and post -operatively) will be measured. Details of concomitantly administered 
products (except standard anaesthesia) along with a brief narrative describing the outcome of the intervention will be recorded.

NOTE: If, in the investigator’s judgement, the  infusion  of  Octafibrin administered  on 
Day 1 is deemed the only infusion needed for treatment of the subject’s bleeding event, the 
subject will need to reach the end of the treatment observation period, where the “24 hours 
(i.e., 1 day) after the last infusion” assessments should be  performed.  
 
All study days after Day 1 (treatment observation period)  
Each subject’s treatment observation period is defined according to the severity of the 
event and will last at least 3 days for minor and 7 days for major bleeding episodes . 
If the patient requires multiple infusions, the actual treatment duration will be determined  
by the investigator based on his /her judgement of the subject’s  condition.  
On subsequent study days (at least 3 days for minor bleeding or 7 days for major bleeding), fibrinogen plasma levels will be measured daily to determine whether additional infusions of Octafibrin are needed. 
 
Daily assessments (for at least 3 days for minor bleeding or 7 days for major bleeding)  
• Blood draw for:  
− fibrinogen plasma level (local lab –activity; central lab –antigen and activity): Based 
on local lab results, the investigator will determine whether addition al infusions of 
Octafibrin are  needed.  
− safety lab  (local –haematology)  
− retention plasma samples for potential retesting.  
• AEs and concomitant  medications.  
Octafibrin infusion, as required  
After these daily assessments, dosing should occur as required depending on the actual and target plasma level and based on the following criteria:  
• If the actual fibrinogen plasma level is below the accepted lower limit of the target 
fibrinogen plasma leve l (80 mg/dL for minor bleeding, 130 mg/dL for major bleeding), 
the subject should receive another infusion of  Octafibrin . 
• If the fibrinogen plasma level is greater than or equal to the accepted lower limit of the 
target fibrinogen plasma level, Octafibrin should not be administered on that  day.

Pre- and post -infusion assessments  
If the subject receives an infusion of Octafibrin , the following pre - and post -infusion assess-  
ments will be done. 
Pre-infusion assessments:  
• Blood draw for (within 30 minutes before  infusion):  
− fibrinogen plasma level (local lab –activity; central lab –antigen and activity)

− immunogenicity  
− retention plasma samples for potential retesting.  
• AEs and concomitant  medications.  
Day 30 (29 days after the first infusion) —Final Examination  
On Day 30 (± 1 week), the following assessments will be performed:  
• Physical  examination.  
• Blood draw for:  
− immunogenicity  
− retention plasma samples for potential retesting.  
• AEs and concomitant  medications.  
The Day 30 assessment concludes the series of observations for a bleeding episode. No 
further study -related assessments for this episode will be performed, unless safety concerns 
(e.g., ongoing AEs) require follow -up. Subjects returning to the study site f or another acute 
bleeding episode within the study observation period will again undergo the same series of Day 1 to Day 30 assessments as outlined above. At the end of the study duration, all subjects will be asked to return for a Study Completion Visit.  
If the patient experiences another bleeding event between Day 14 and Day 30, this will be treated as a new bleeding event, provided that it is not directly related to the prior event. In this case, Day 30 evaluations will be postponed until 30 days after t he start of the new 
bleeding episode. 
Any additional bleeding episodes will be documented in the same way as the first bleeding 
episode. They will not be used for the analysis of the primary endpoint, but they will be included in the analysis as a secondar y endpoint.  
 
ASSESSMENTS IN SUBJECTS UNDERGOING SURGICAL PROPHYLAXIS  
In the case of a surgical procedure, Octafibrin will be given prior to surgery as well as 
during and after surgery based on the physician’s judgement, the patient’s history, and the sever ity of the procedure. Subjects enrolled for elective surgery will be treated (as required) 
and assessed throughout the surgical observation period.  
The surgical observation period starts with the first dose of Octafibrin administered prior 
to elective surg ery (Day 1) and, depending on the severity of the event, will last at least       
3 post -operative days for minor and 7 post -operative days for major surgeries or until the 
day of the last post -operative infusion, whichever comes  last. 
NOTE: All adverse ev ents (AEs), including thromboembolic events and early signs of 
allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, occurring between first infusion of IMP before the start of surgery and the Last Post -operative Day will be  recorded.

Patients may remain in the study until the 24th patient has at least one documented bleeding 
episode. When the study is closed, all subjects will be asked to return for a Study Completion Visit.  
 
Study Completion Visit 
At the end of the study duration, all subjects will be asked to return for a Study Completion 
Visit, during which the following assessments will be performed:  
• Blood draw for retention serum samples for potential viral testing.  
• Physical  examination.  
After the Study Completion Visit, the clinical study is considered completed for the subject.  
If the subject has not been treated for bleeding or surgery, subject will be notified that the study has ended and will be considered a ‘no treatment’ patient and report ed separately. No 
further assessments will need to be performed.  
 
Statistical analysis:  
Continuous variables will be summarised using descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum, and number of observations and missing observations). Categorical variables will be summarised with counts and percentages.  
Efficacy analysis  
 
Primary endpoint  
For bleeding efficacy, the primary endpoint is the overall clinical assessment of the haemo-  
static efficacy of Octafibrin in treating the first documented bleeding episode of each 
patient. The first bleeding ep isode covers the time period from the first Octafibrin infusion 
until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the last infusion or the end of the treatment observation 
period, whichever comes  last. 
For the statistical analysis, the assessment made by the investigator on the 4- point rating 
scale will be transformed to a dichotomous endpoint with success defined as a rating of excellent or good. The success rate will be calculated as the proportion of patients with success, and the two -sided 90% Blyth- Still-Casella conf idence interval (CI) will be 
calculated. By comparing the lower limit of this confidence interval with a predefined threshold of 0.7, the hypothesis that the success rate is greater than 0.7 will be tested (H
0: p 
≤ 0.7 / H A: p > 0.7). The final efficacy assessment of each patient will be adjudicated by an 
Independent Data Monitoring & Endpoint Adjudication Committee (IDMEAC).

Secondary  endpoints  
 
Clot strength  (MCF)  
Fibrinogen levels 1 hour after infusion of the investigational medicinal product (IMP), MCF 
at pre infusion and at 1 hour after first and last infusion as well as changes of MCF from pre infusion will be summarised using descriptive statistics and displaye d graphically. In 
addition, a correlation analysis between MCF and the haemostatic efficacy assessment will be performed.  
 
Octafibrin use  
The dose of the IMP used per day and in total will be summarised using descriptive statistics for minor and major blee ding events. Frequency of infusions and duration of 
treatment will also be  summarised.  
 
In-vivo recovery (IVR)  
Response and classical IVR will be calculated for each infusion of each subject. Descriptive tables will show the distributions of the 2 parameters per infusion day separated for minor and major bleeding events. An exploratory analysis using a repeated -measures analysis of 
covariance model will analyse whether the response/classical IVR changed over time, with dose associated with respective IVR as covariate in model.  
 
Surgical prophylaxis  
Efficacy of Octafibrin in surgical prophylaxis will be assessed intr a-operatively (at the end 
of surgery = after last suture) by the surgeon and post -operatively by the haematologist 
using two 4 -point efficacy scales. The overall surgical efficacy will be adjudicated by the 
IDMEAC.  
Safety analysis  
Safety parameters will be  descriptively summarised.  
 
Interim analysis  
An interim analysis will be performed after data is available for the first bleeding episode of 10 subjects; 2 of these subjects should be between 12 and 18 years old. Descriptive efficacy and safety analysis wi ll be performed and presented to IDMEAC.

1 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background  
Human fibrinogen is a plasma glycoprotein synthesised in the liver, and it circulates in the 
plasma at a concentration of 2.9 –4.5 g/L. In healthy human adults, about 2–5 g of fibrinogen 
is synthesised daily, and the same amount is catabolised [1, 2]. Fibri nogen is essential for 
haemostasis, wound healing, fibrinolysis, inflammation, angiogenesis, cellular and matrix interactions, and neoplasia. These processes involve the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin, 
and often the interaction of fibrinogen with var ious proteins and cells. The plasma half -life of 
fibrinogen, under normal physiological conditions, has been estimated to be 3–5 days [3, 4]. 
The plasma level of clottable fibrinogen may be markedly decreased or even undetectable in 
various congenital or a cquired conditions [5, 6]. Conditions of congenital fibrinogen 
deficiency include:  
• Afibrinogenaemia: Complete absence or extremely low levels of plasma  fibrinogen.  
• Hypofibrinogenaemia: Reduced concentration of plasma fibrinogen. 
• Dysfibrinogenaemia: Presence of abnormal or dysfunctional fibrinogen molecules.  
Congenital afibrinogenaemia is a rare inherited autosomal recessive disorder occurring in homozygotic patients with an estimated incidence of 1 in 10
6 in the European population [7]. 
The disease is characterised by a complete lack of coagulable and/or immunologically determinable fibrinogen in the plasma. Patients present with frequent severe bleeding  episodes since birth or early childhood [8, 9]. Bleeding may occur after a minor trauma or a 
small surgi cal intervention, into the skin, mucosa, muscles, gastrointestinal tract, or the  brain.  
Congenital hypofibrinogenaemia is more common than afibrinogenaemia and is characterised 
by low but measurable fibrinogen plasma levels. Clinical symptoms of hypofibrinogenaemia are usually milder compared to afibrinogenaemia, and the condition is frequently combined 
with a dysfibrinogenaemia that is characterised by an abnormal fibrinogen variant. Several 
missense mutations in the 3 fibrinogen genes have been identified  as the cause of 
dysfibrinogenaemia and hypofibrinogenaemia that lead to abnormal gene expression resulting in the decreased fibrinogen concentration or dysfunctional fibrinogen molecules.  
Therapeutic substitution with human fibrinogen concentrate can corr ect the haemostatic  
defect and arrest bleeding in patients with these fibrinogen deficiencies [5, 7, 9, 10, 11]. 
 
1.2 Octafibrin  
Octafibrin is a highly purified, lyophilised, human plasma fibrinogen concentrate, without 
added albumins. Octafibrin is double vi rus inactivated using 2 dedicated virus inactiva - 
tion/removal steps, i.e., solvent/detergent treatment and nanofiltration.  
Solvent/detergent treatment mode of action causes enveloped viruses to be irreversibly destroyed. These include the most transfusion- relevant viruses, such as human 
immunodeficiency virus types l and 2 (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] -1, HIV -2), 
hepatit is B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), but also many other adventitious agents, 
e.g., newly emerging viruses that are enveloped, such as West Nile virus (WNV).

The Planova 20N filter was specifically developed by Asahi Kasei Phar ma Corp. to remove 
infectious agents from protein solutions on the basis of their size. Thus, this nanofiltration  
step is in principle effective for removing even very small enveloped and non- enveloped 
viruses. Nanofiltration may be the only method to dat e permitting efficient removal of 
enveloped and non- enveloped viruses under conditions where 90- 95% of protein activity is 
recovered  [12].  
 
1.3 Rationale for Conducting the  Study  
It is estimated that there are 500 to 1000 patients with congenital fibrinogen de ficiency in the 
European Union (EU). Historically, the principal source for the treatment of congenital fibrinogen deficiency has been cryoprecipitate [7]. Plasma -derived and viral -inactivated 
fibrinogen concentrates are proven to be safer and more specifi c in the treatment of congenital 
fibrinogen deficiency compared to cryoprecipitate  [13].  
The introduction of Octafibrin will present an additional and safe option, providing more 
choices of supply for the benefit of the medical community and patients affected by congenital fibrinogen deficiency.  
This phase III study is designed as a multinational, multi -centre, prospective,  open -label, 
uncontrolled study to assess the efficacy and safety of Octafibrin for on- demand treatment of 
acute bleeding in subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency. 
As there are currently no guidelines concerning fibrinogen concentrates in either t he United 
States (US) or the EU, this pivotal study was designed following the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Recombinant and Human Plasma - 
Derived Factor IX Products (CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009) [14] and discussions with the Paul Ehrlich Institute and the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) of the EMA.  
 
1.4 Dose Rationale  
The dose rationale is based on published data from a questionnaire survey based upon the data obtained in 100 a - or hypofibrinogenaemic patients [15]. Based on this representative sample 
(53 males and 47 females with median fibrinogen plasma level of 6 mg dL
-1), the peak 
fibrinogen plasma level most often recommended for on -demand treatment of minor bleeding 
was approximately 100 mg/dL, but the target level for m ajor episodes, such as central nervous 
system bleeding, was higher (150 mg/dL). Minor episodes, like epistaxis, gum bleeding, menorrhagia, were usually treated with target peaks of 50 to 70 mg/dL. Duration of treatment ranged from 1 to 2 weeks for major events, from 1 to 7 days for minor events. Minor surgeries were treated for up to 7 days with a target fibrinogen plasma level of 100 mg/dL. Major surgeries were treated for 4 to 14 days with a target fibrinogen plasma level of 150 mg/dL.

1.5 Benefit- Risk  Statement 
Effective management of congenital fibrinogen deficiencies in bleeding situations is  
necessary for the prevention of potentially life -threatening bleeding episodes.  
Studies consistently showed that fibrinogen substitution was able  to successfully control 
bleeding, increase fibrinogen plasma levels, and reduce the amount of transfusions needed with allogeneic blood products. In addition, it was shown to be well tolerated and to have a very good overall safety profile.  
Provided that the pharmacokinetic (PK) values are in the same range as for the already 
licensed fibrinogen concentrate, Octafibrin is expected to be efficacious in the treatment of 
congenital fibrinogen deficiency.  
As known for other fibrinogen plasma -derived concentrat es, the following adverse reactions 
may occur with the use of Octafibrin : 
1. Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions.  
Observed symptoms may include hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, and hypotension. These reactions may progress to severe anaphylaxis, 
including shock. 
2. Thromboembolic  events.  
Such events have been reported in patients treated with plasma -derived fibrinogen 
concentrates. Thus, patients receiving Octafibrin should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of thrombosis.  
3. Infections caused by medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma. Standard measures to prevent these infections include the selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma pools for specific markers of infection, and the inclus ion 
of effective manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to 
unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. The measures taken are considered 
effective for enveloped viruses, such as HIV, HBV, and HCV, and for the non- enveloped 
hepatitis A virus (HAV). The measures taken may be of limited value against  non- 
enveloped viruses, such as parvovirus  B19. 
In conclusion, there is no reason to believe that participation in this study presents the subjects with any greater risk of viral transmission or thrombosis than treatment with currently marketed products. The manufacturing process of Octafibrin , which includes 2 viral 
inactivation steps with different chemical/physical action principles, represents a high 
standard for plasma -derived concentrates in terms of viral  safety.

2 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary  Objective  
The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of Octafibrin for on -demand treatment of 
acute bleeding episodes (spontaneous or after trauma).  
 
2.2 Secondary  Objectives  
The secondary objectives are:  
• To show an association between the overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy 
and the surrogate endpoint ‘clot strength’ or ‘clot firmness’ (referred to as ‘maximum 
clot firmness’ [MCF] in this protocol) that was used as a surrogate endpoint for 
haemostatic efficacy and determined via thromboelastography (TEG) in the pivotal PK study FORMA -01. Therefore, MCF as surrogate efficacy parameter will be determined 
before first infusion and 1 hour after end of first and last infusion. 
• To achieve a peak target plasma fibrinogen level of 100 mg/dL in minor bleeds and   150 mg/dL for major bleeds 1 hour  post-infusion.  
• To determine the response to Octafibrin based on incremental in vivo recovery (IVR).  
• To demonstrate the efficacy of Octafib rin in preventing bleeding during and after 
surgery.  
• To assess the safety of Octafibrin in subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency, 
including immunogenicity, thromboembolic complications, and early signs of allergic 
or hypersensitivity  reactions.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN 
 
3.1 Primary and Secondary  Endpoints  
 
3.1.1 Primary  Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the overall clinical assessment of the haemostatic efficacy of 
Octafibrin in treating the first documented bleeding episode of each patient. The first bleeding 
episode covers the time period from the first Octafibrin infusion until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) 
after the last infusion or the end of the treatment observation period, whichever comes last.  
The investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for bleeding will be 
based on a 4- point haemostatic efficacy scale as described in Section 7.2.1. The final efficacy 
assessment of each patient will be adjudicated by the Independent Data Monitoring & 
Endpoint Adjudication Committee (IDMEAC).  
In the final analysis, the number of subjects per outcome category will be assessed.  
 
3.1.2 Secondary  Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
• MCF assessment before first infusion and 1 hour after end of first and last infusion of 
each documented bleeding episode (see Section  7.2.2.1). 
• Fibrinogen plasma level before and 1 hour after the end of each subsequent infusion as well as at the  time  of the  overall  clinical  assessment  of  haemostatic efficacy (i.e.,  
24 hours after the last infusion of each documented bleeding  episode).  
• Resp onse as indicated by incremental IVR, calculated as the maximum increase in 
plasma fibrinogen (Clauss data) between pre- infusion and 1 and 3 hours post -infusion 
(see Section  7.2.2.2). 
• Efficacy of Octafibrin in all bleeding episodes collected in the study using the 
investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for bleeding based on 
a 4-point haemostatic efficacy  scale.  
• Efficacy of Octafibrin in preventing bleeding during and after surgery as assessed at the 
end of surgery by the surgeon and post -operatively by the haematologist using two 4-  
point haemostatic efficacy scales (see Section 7.2.2.3). An overall efficacy assessment 
taking both the intra- and post -operative assessment into account will be adjudicated by 
the IDMEAC. The surgical observation period starts with the first dose of Octafibrin administered prior to elective surgery (Day 1) and, depending on the severity of the event, will l ast at least 3 post -operative days for minor and 7 post -operative days for 
major surgeries or until the day of the last post -operative infusion, whichever comes 
last. The number of subjects per outcome category will be assessed and will include at least 4  surgeries.

The safety endpoints are:  
• Vital signs.  
• Physical  examination.  
• Routine clinical laboratory assessment, including coagulation  parameters.  
• Adverse events (AEs), including thromboembolic complications and early signs of 
allergic o r hypersensitivity  reactions.  
• Immunogenicity testing at Day 14 and Day 30 after the administration of Octafibrin for 
bleeding.  
 
3.2 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a multinational, multi- centre, prospective, open- label, uncontrolled, Phase III study to 
assess the efficacy and safety of Octafibrin for on- demand treatment of acute bleeding and 
surgical prophylaxis in subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency.  
A total of 24 male and female subjects with congenital fibrinogen deficiency will be enrolled in the study. This will include at least 4 subjects aged between 12 and 18 years (only 18 and above in Russia). This will also include at least 4 surgeries, 2 of which should be performed in subjects aged between 12 and 18 years (only 18 and above in Russia). The study will be conducted in approximately 15 study centres worldwide.  
During the study observation period, enrolled patients will be treated for any bleedi ng 
episodes or planned surgeries that can be managed under the protocol. Patients may remain in the study until the 24th patient has at least one documented bleeding episode. The study will be considered completed when a minimum of 24 subjects have at leas t one documented 
bleeding episode. The study as a whole should be completed within 5 years.  
As many bleeding episodes or surgeries as possible occurring throughout the study obser - 
vation period will be documented. Only the first bleeding episodes will be used for the analysis of the primary endpoint. All bleeding episodes documented in the study will be assessed as a secondary endpoint.  
The investigator will inform the monitor of any recruitment difficulty or delay of the anticipated completion date.  
Patie nts should be treated with the investigational medicinal product (IMP) whenever 
possible. If, in the opinion of the investigator, a bleeding episode is not effectively stopped or 
surgical prophylaxis is not adequate after the recommended dose of Octafibrin  has been 
administered, the subject may receive a different licensed fibrinogen concentrate (e.g., 
Haemocomplettan P
®/RiaSTAP™) or whatever the investigator considers standard of care. 
The use of another licensed fibrinogen concentrate is also permitted in emergency situations, e.g., if the IMP is not available for the patient in  time.

3.2.1 On-demand Treat ment of Acute Bleeding  
Subjects presenting to the study site for on- demand treatment of an acute bleeding episode 
who are eligible for enrolment and have provided written informed consent will be included 
into the study. 
Each subject will receive at least 1 infusion of Octafibrin for the treatment of acute bleeding 
on Day 1. The individual subject observation and follow -up period for each documented 
episode starts with the first dose of Octafibrin administered for on -demand treatment of an 
acute bleeding ep isode (Day 1) and will be followed for up to Day 30. 
Each subject’s treatment observation period is defined according to the severity of the event 
and will last at least 3 days for minor and 7 days for major bleeding episodes. 
On each day of the treatment observation period (i.e., 3 days for minor and 7 days for major 
bleeding), fibrinogen plasma levels will be measured daily to determine whether additional infusions of Octafibrin are needed:  
• Additional infusions of Octafibrin should be administered if the actual fibrinogen plasma 
level measured on these days is  below  the  accepted  lower  limit  of  the  target  level  
(80 mg/dL for minor bleeding, 130 mg/dL for major  bleeding).  
• If the actual  fibrinogen plasma level  is above  the accepted  lower  limit  of the target level,  
Octafibrin should not be administered.  
 
The actual treatment duration will be determined by the investigator based on his/her 
judgement of the subject’s condition.  
All adverse events (AEs), including thromboembolic events and early signs of allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, occurring between the start of the first Octafibrin infusion and the 
end of each 30- day observation and follow -up period will be recorded. Concomitant 
medications will also be recorded throughout each 30- day observation and follow -up period.  
All SAEs occurring after the first IMP infusion will be documented and reported for a patient throughout the duration of the patient’s participation in t he study or as required to meet local 
regulations. Also, any concomitant medications used to treat an SAE will be recorded.  
At the end of the study (i.e., when the 24th patient has had at least one treated bleeding epi - 
sode), all patients will be asked to  return for a Study Completion Visit.  
 
3.2.2 Surgical  Prophylaxis  
Subjects planning to undergo elective surgery may also be enrolled in the study.  
Within 3 hours prior to surgery, each patient will receive a loading infusion of Octafibrin to 
achieve a recommended fibrinogen plasma level of  100  mg/dL  for  minor  surgeries  and 150 mg/dL for major  surgeries.  
Each subject’s surgical observation perio d starts with the first dose of Octafibrin 
administered prior to elective surgery (Day 1) and, depending on the severity of the event, will last at least 3 post -operative days for minor and 7 post -operative days for major surgeries 
or until the day of the last post -operative infusion, whichever comes  last. 
Study Protocol 
No. FORMA -02 CONFIDENTIAL  Version 6.0  
31-Oct-2014  
Page 14  
  
On each post -operative day, fibrinogen plasma levels will be measured daily (i.e., at least 3 
post-operative days for minor and 7 post -operative days for major surgeries) to determine 
whether additional infusions of Octafibrin are needed. 
• Additional infusions of Octafibrin should be administered if the actual fibrinogen plasma 
level measured on subsequent days is below the accepted lower limit of the target level 
(80 mg/dL for minor surgeries, 130 mg/dL for major  surgery).  
• If the fibrinogen plasma level is greater than or equal to the accepted lower limit of the target fibrinogen plasma level, Octafibrin should not be  administered.  
The actual treatment duration will be determined by the i nvestigator based on his/her judge - 
ment of the subject’s condition.  
All AEs, including thromboembolic events and early signs of allergic or hypersensitivity 
reactions, occurring between first infusion of IMP before the start of surgery and the Last 
Post-Operative Day will be recorded.  
All SAEs occurring after the first IMP infusion will be documented and reported for a patient 
throughout the duration of the patient’s participation in the study or as required to meet local regulations. Also, any concomitant  medications used to treat an SAE will be recorded.  
At the end of the study (i.e., when the 24th patient has had at least one treated bleeding episode), all patients will be asked to return for a Study Completion Visit.  
 
3.3 Discussion of Study Design and Choi ce of Control  Group(s) 
As there are currently no guidelines concerning fibrinogen concentrates in either the US or the EU, the study was designed following established programs for Factor IX concentrates. 
Typically, the clinical evaluation of a new concentrate initially examines  the IVR and the PK 
properties of the principal active factor. Prior to initiating the present study, comparative PK 
data have been obtained in study FORMA -01. 
The open- label uncontrolled design and choice of study objectives are motivated by 
regulatory re quirements for Factor IX [14] and discussions with the regulatory  bodies.  
The median response value used in the fibrinogen dosage calculation is the median incremental in vivo recovery reported in the interim analysis of study FORMA -01. 
Although all bleedi ng episodes occurring throughout the study observation period will be 
documented, only the first bleeding episode per patient will be used for the analysis of the primary endpoint (see Section 3.1.1). This is because the study will end once the 24th enroll ed 
patient has at least one documented bleeding episode, potentially resulting in a large diversity 
in the number of bleeding episodes between patients. The entirety of bleeding episodes 
documented in the study will be assessed as a secondary endpoint (see  Section 3.1.2).

Patients should be treated with IMP whenever possible. If, in the opinion of the investigator, a 
bleeding episode is not effectively stopped or surgical prophylaxis is not adequate after the recommended dose of Octafibrin has been administered, the subject  may receive a different 
licensed fibrinogen concentrate (e.g., Haemocomplettan P
®/RiaSTAP™) or whatever the 
investigator considers standard of care. The use of another licensed fibrinogen concentrate is 
also permitted in emergency situations, e.g., if the  IMP is not available for the patient in time.  
 
4.4.2 Forbidden Concomitant  Therapy  
Subjects may not receive any coagulation- active drug (i.e., non- steroidal anti- inflammatory 
drugs, warfarin, coumarin derivatives, platelet aggregation inhibitors) within 1 week prior to 
start of treatment for the bleeding episode or surgery, or as a planned or expected medication during the time period from Day 1 until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the last Octafibrin infusion.  
 
4.5 Withdrawal and Replacement of Subjects  
4.5.1 Premature Subject  Withdrawal  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, without the need to justify their decision. The investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects in case of AEs, protocol violations, or other reasons. Since  an excessive rate of withdrawal can render 
the study non- interpretable, the unnecessary withdrawal of subjects must be  avoided.  
For any discontinuation after study entry, the investigator will obtain all the required details and document the reason(s) for  discontinuation in the CRF. If the reason for withdrawal of a 
subject is an AE, the main specific event or laboratory test will be recorded in the CRF, and the investigator will make thorough efforts to clearly document the outcome.  
 
If possible, the Study Completion Visit should be performed.  
 
4.5.2 Subject Replacement  Policy  
Subjects withdrawn from the study for safety reasons will not be replaced.  
 
4.6 Assignment of Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Not applicable.  
 
4.7 Relevant Protocol Deviations  
In the case of any major protocol deviation or violation, the investigator and Octapharma will decide on the further participation of the subject in this study, after having discussed all relevant aspects.  
 
4.8 Subsequent  Therapy  
In case the bleeding is not ef fectively stopped or surgical prophylaxis is deemed not to be 
adequate after the recommended Octafibrin dosing as judged by the  investigator  (see  
Section 5.4), the subject may receive a different licensed fibrinogen concentrate (e.g., Haemocomplettan P
®/RiaSTAP™) or whatever the investigator considers standard of  care.

(mg/kg  body  weight)   Median response* (mg/dL per mg/kg body  weight)   
 
5.4.1 Octafibrin Dose  Calculation  
Octafibrin will be individually dosed to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level dependent on the type of bleeding or surgery (minor or major). The dose will  be 
calculated individually as  follows:  
 
*The median response in this dose calculation formula is the median incremental in vivo recovery reported in the 
interim analysis of study FORMA -01. 
**The measured level for the first infusion will be the historical level for that patient after a washout or, if below the 
limit of detection of the local assay, zero (0) will be used.  
 
5.4.2 Dosing for On -demand Treatment of  Bleeding  
For each bleeding episode that is treated as part of the study, each subject will receive at least 
1 infusion  of Octafibrin for the treatment  of a  major or minor acute bleeding episode on  
Day 1. 
Octafibrin will be individually dosed to achieve a recomm ended target fibrinogen plasma 
level dependent on the bleeding type (minor or  major).  
• Minor bleeding will be treated to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level of 100 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 80 mg/dL.  
• Major bleeding will be treated to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level of 150 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 130 mg/dL. 
 
On subsequent study days, fibrinogen plasma levels will be measured daily to determine whether additional infusio ns of Octafibrin are needed:  
• Minor bleeding will be observed for at least 3  days.  
• Major bleeding will be observed for at least 7  days. 
Additional Octafibrin infusions, as required  
• Additional infusions of Octafibrin should be administered if the actual fibr inogen 
plasma level measured on subsequent study days is below the accepted lower limit of the target level (80 mg/dL for minor bleeding, 130 mg/dL for major bleeding). 
• If the actual fibrinogen plasma level is above the accepted lower limit of the target level,  
Octafibrin should not be administered.  
 
Definition of minor and major bleeding  
• Minor bleeding events are defined as mild haemarthrosis or superficial muscle, soft 
tissue, and oral  bleeding.  
• Major bleeding events are defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, 
such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular, or pericardial bleeding, or intramuscular bleeding with compa rtment syndrome, or bleeding causing a 
decrease in haemoglobin level by 20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L) or  more.  
Characterisation of any other bleeding events not within these categories will be discussed individually with the investigator.

5.4.3 Dosing  for Surgery  
For each surgery that is treated as part of the study, within 3 hours prior to surgery, subjects 
will receive a loading infusion of Octafibrin . 
Octafibrin will be individually dosed to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level dependent on the surgery type (minor or  major).  
• Patients undergoing minor surgery will be treated to achieve a recommended target 
fibrinogen plasma level of 100 mg/dL and an accepted lower limit of 80 mg/dL.  
• Patients undergoing major surgery will be treated to achieve a recommended target 
fibrinogen plasma level of 150 mg/dL and an acce pted lower limit of 130  mg/dL.  
On each post -operative day, fibrinogen plasma levels will be measured daily to determine 
whether maintenance infusions of Octafibrin are needed.  
• Minor surgery will be observed for at least 3 post -operative  days. 
• Major surgery  will be observed for at least 7 post -operative  days. 
Maintenance infusions, as required:  
• Additional infusions of Octafibrin should be administered if the actual fibrinogen 
plasma level measured on subsequent study days is below the accepted lower limit of  
the target level (80 mg/dL for minor surgery, 130 mg/dL for major bleeding). 
• If the actual fibrinogen plasma level is above the accepted lower limit of the target level,  
Octafibrin should not be administered.  
 
Definition of minor and major surgery  
Surgeries are defined as major , if any of the following criteria are met:  
• Requiring general or spinal  anaesthesia.  
• Requiring opening into the great body cavities.  
• In the course of which hazards of severe haemorrhage is  possible.  
• Requiring haemostatic therapy for at least 6  days. 
• Orthopaedic interventions involving joints (ankle, knee, hip, wrist, elbow, shoulder).  
• 3rd molar extraction or extraction of > 3 teeth.  
• Surgeries/conditions in which the subject's life is at stake.  
Characterisation of any other surgery not within these categories and considered major by the 
investigator will be discussed individually with the investigator.  
All other surgeries are classified as minor . 
The classification is made prospectively.

5.5 Preparation and Method of  Administration  
 
5.5.1 Preparation  
Each vial of Octafibrin will be reconstituted with 50 mL WFI. The solvent (i.e., WFI) and the 
concentrate in the closed vials must be warmed up to room temperature. Room temperature 
must be maintained during reconstitution. Octafibrin dissolves at room temperature to an 
almost co lourless and slightly opalescent solution within 30 minutes. If the solution is cloudy 
or contains particulates, it should not be used. The solution should not be frozen.  
Octafibrin should be administered immediately after  reconstitution at a  rate not ex ceeding    
5 mL per minute. Octafibrin should not be mixed with other medicinal products or 
intravenous  solutions.  
 
5.5.2 Method of Administration  
Octafibrin will be administered as intravenous (i.v.) infusion.  
NOTE: In this study, only bolus injections of Octaf ibrin are permitted. Continuous infusion 
is not allowed. 
 
5.6 Blinding, Emergency Envelopes, and Breaking the Study  Blind  
Not applicable.  
 
5.7 Drug Dispensing and  Accountability  
A drug dispensing log and the inventory will be kept current by the investigator, deta iling the 
dates and quantities of IMP dispensed to each subject. The inventory will be available to the monitor to verify drug accountability during the study. Any unused or partially used IMP, including empty containers (if possible), will be accounted for.  
Unused IMP may be destroyed at the study site, however, only after drug accountability has been verified and fully re -conciliated and written approval from the Sponsor has been 
obtained. Unused IMP can be returned to the Sponsor for destruction when drug accountability has been verified and fully re -conciliated and written approval from the 
Sponsor has been received.  
 
5.8 Assessment of Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance will be measured in terms of the subject receiving an infusion of 
Octafibrin from the study personnel. Administered doses of Octafibrin will be recorded for 
every infusion, including dates, times, and batch numbers; the batch numbers w ill be reported 
in the final study report.

• Inclusion and exclusion criteria, including written informed consent for participation in 
the study.  
• Demography, medical history (inclu ding details concerning allergic tendencies), review of 
previous  therapy.  
NOTE: If the period between screening and treatment is more than 3 months, informed 
consent will be re -reviewed and confirmed prior to treatment, and details of the review 
process wi ll be recorded in the patient chart and indicated in the CRF by the investigator. Also 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be confirmed prior to  treatment.  
 
6.1.2 Assessments in Subjects Undergoing On -demand Treatment of  Bleeding  
Subjects presenting to the study s ite for an acute bleeding episode will undergo a 30- day 
observation and follow -up period as outlined below. Throughout the study, subjects may 
undergo more than one 30- day observation and follow -up periods for treatment of additional 
bleeding episodes as r equired until the close of the study. At the end of their study 
participation, patients will be asked to return for a final Study Completion Visit.  
For information on the dose calculation and a definition of minor and major bleeding, see 
Section 5.4.2. The  flow chart of assessments  for  on -demand  treatment  is  provided  on  
page  xxi. 
NOTE: All adverse events (AEs, see Section 7.4), including thromboembolic events and 
early signs of allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, occurring between the start of th e first 
Octafibrin infusion and the end of each 30- day observation and follow -up period will be 
recorded. Concomitant medications will also be recorded throughout each 30- day observation 
and follow -up period. Administered doses of Octafibrin will be record ed for every infusion, 
including dates, times, and batch numbers.  
All SAEs occurring after the first IMP infusion will be documented and reported for a patient throughout the duration of the patient’s participation in the study or as required to meet local

6.1.2.1 Day 1 (first day of  treatment)  
For subjects requiring on -demand treatment, Day 1 is the day they present for treatment of an 
acute bleeding episode.  
 
Pre-infusion assessments 
The following assessments will be performed before the first infusion of Octafibrin for each 
bleeding episode:  
• Medical history (including details of any non- study bleeding episodes and therapy), and 
prior/concomitant  medication.  
• Characterisation of bleedin g episode.  
• Vital signs.  
• Physical  examination.

30 minutes before  infusion)  
– MCF (within 30 minutes before  infusion).  
– safety lab (local –haematology and clinical  chemistry)  
– thrombogenicity  
– immunogenicity  
retention plasma and serum samples for potential retesting (within 30 minutes 
before infusion). 
• Urine (dip stick) or blood pregnancy test for all female subjects of childbearing potential.  
 
NOTE: If the period between screening and treatment is more than 3 months, informed 
consent will be re -reviewed and confirmed prior to treatment, and details of t he review 
process will be recorded in the patient chart and indicated in the CRF by the investigator. 
Also, inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be confirmed prior to  treatment.  
 
First infusion of Octafibrin  
After the pre -infusion assessments, subjects will receive the first infusion of Octafibrin for 
treatment of bleeding (see Section 5.4).

Page 24  
  
Post-infusion assessments 
On Day 1, the following post -infusion assessments will be performed:  
 
1 hour (±15 minutes) after the end of infusion:  
• Vital signs.  
• Blood draw for:  
– fibrinogen plasma level (local lab –activity; central lab –antigen and activity)  
– MCF  
– safety lab (local –haematology and clinical  chemistry)  
– thrombogenicity

3 hours (±15 minutes) after the end of infusion:  
• Vital signs.  
• Blood draw for:  
– fibrinogen plasma level (central lab –antigen and activity)  
– safety lab (local –haematology and clinical  chemistry)  
– thrombogenicit y 
– retention plasma samples for potential retesting.  
• AEs and concomitant  medications.  
NOTE: If, in the investigator’s judgement, the infusion of Octafibrin administered on Day 1 
is deemed the only infusion needed for treatment of the subject’s bleeding event, the subject 
will need to reach the end of the treatment observation period, where the “24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the last infusion” assessments shoul d be performed.  
 
6.1.2.2 All Study Days after Day 1 (Treatment Observation  Period)  
Each subject’s treatment observation period is defined according to the severity of the event and will last at least 3 days for minor and 7 days for major bleeding episodes . If the patient 
requires multiple infusions, the actual treatment duration will be determined by the investigator based on his/her judgement of the subject’s condition, and the treatment observation period will last until 24 hours after the last infusion. 
 
Daily assessments (for at least 3 days for minor bleeding or 7 days for major bleeding)  
• Blood draw for:  
– fibrinogen plasma level (local lab –activity; central lab –antigen and activity): Based 
on local lab results, the investigator will determine whether additional infusions of Octafibrin are  needed.  
– safety lab  (local –haematology)  
– retention plasma samples for p otential retesting.  
• AEs and concomitant  medications.

Octafibrin infusion, as required  
After these daily assessments, dosing should occur as required depending on the actual and 
target plasma levels based on the following criteria:  
• If the actual fibrinogen plasma level is below the accepted lower limit of the target 
fibrinogen plasma level ( 80 mg/dL for minor bleeding, 130 mg/dL for major bleeding; 
see Section 5.4), the subject should receive another infusion of  Octafibrin . 
• If the fibrinogen plasma level is greater than or equal to the accepted lower limit of the 
target fibrinogen plasma leve l, Octafibrin should not be administered on that  day. 
 
Pre- and post -infusion assessments  
If the subject receives an infusion of Octafibrin , the following pre - and post -infusion 
assessments will be performed:  
 
Pre-infusion assessments:  
• Blood draw for (with in 30 minutes before  infusion):  
– fibrinogen plasma level (local lab –activity; central lab –antigen and activity)  
– retention plasma samples for potential retesting.

– retention plasma samples for potential retesting.  
 
NOTE: If, in the investigator’s judgemen t, there are no additional infusions of Octafibrin 
needed to treat the bleeding event, the subject will need to reach the end of the treatment observation period, where the “24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the last infusion” assessments should be  performed.  
 
6.1.2.3 Last Infusion or End of the Observation Period (whichever comes last) 
If a patient requires multiple infusions for a bleeding event as defined by the investigator based on his/her judgement of the subject’s condition , or the subject comes to the end of the observation period (whichever comes last), the following assessments will be performed:  
 
Pre-infusion assessments 
The following assessments will be performed prior to the last infusion of Octafibrin if 
multiple infusions are  needed:  
• Blood draw for (within 30 minutes before  infusion):  
– fibrinogen plasma level (local lab –activity; central lab –antigen and activity)  
– retent ion plasma samples for potential retesting.

6.1.2.4 Day 14 (13 Days after the First  Infusion)  
On Day 14 (± 2 days), the following assessments will be performed:  
• Blood draw for:  
– immunogenicity  
– retention plasma samples for potential retesting.  
• AEs and concomitant  medications.  
 
6.1.2.5 Day 30 (29 Days after the First Infusion) —Final  Examination  
On Day 30 (± 1 week), the following assessments will be performed:  
• Physical  examination.  
• Blood draw for:  
– immunogenicity  
– retention plasma samples for potential retesting.  
• AEs and concomitant  medications.  
The Day 30 assessment concludes the series of observations by bleeding episode. No further 
study- related assessments will be performed, unless safety concerns (e.g., ongoing AEs) 
require follow -up. 
Subjects returning to the study site for another acute ble eding episode within the study 
observation period will again undergo the same Day 1 to Day 30 assessments as outlined in Section 6.1.2.1 through Section 6.1.2.5. At the end of the study duration, all subjects will be asked to return for a Study Completion Visit as summarised in Section 6.1.4.  
If a patient experiences another bleeding event between Day 14 and Day 30, this will be treated as a new bleeding event, provided that it is not directly related to the prior event. In 
this case, the Day 30 evaluations  will be postponed until 30 days after the start of the new 
bleeding episode.  
Any additional bleeding episodes will be documented in the same way as the first bleeding episode. These will not be used for the analysis of the primary endpoint, but they will be 
analysed as a secondary endpoint.  
 
6.1.3 Assessments in Subjects Undergoing Surgical  Prophylaxis  
Subjects enrolled for elective surgery will undergo a treatment and assessment cycle as outlined in Section 6.1.3.1 through Section 6.1.3.3. Octafibrin will be given prior to surgery 
as well as during and after surgery based on the physician’s judgement, the patient’s history, and the severity of the procedure. Subjects enrolled for elective surgery will be treated (as required) and assessed from Day 1 (i .e., the day of surgery) to the Last Post -Operative Day. 
The Last Post -Operative Day is either post -operative day 3 for minor and post -operative day 7 
for major surgery or the day of the last post -operative infusion, whichever comes  last. 
For information o n the dose calculation and a definition of minor and major surgery, see 
Section 5.4.

• brief narrative describing the details of hospitalisation (start and end date, details of the 
procedure), follow -up, outcome, and efficacy of the  intervention. 
 
The assessments performed on the Last Post -Operative Day conclude the surgical observation 
period. No further study -related assessments will be performed, unless safety concerns (e.g., 
ongoing AEs) require follow -up. 
 
Patients may remain in the study until the 24th patient has at least one documented bleeding 
episode. When the study is closed, all s ubjects will be asked to return for a Study Completion 
Visit as summarised in Section 6.1.4.  
 
6.1.4 Study Completion  Visit  
At the end of the study duration, all subjects will be asked to return for a Study Completion Visit, during which the following assessments  will be performed:  
• Blood draw for retention serum samples for potential viral testing.  
• Physical  examination.  
After the Study Completion Visit, the clinical study is considered completed for the subject.  
If the subject has not been treated for bleeding or surgery, the subject will be notified that the 
study has ended and will be considered a ‘no treatment’ patient and reported separately. No 
further assessments need to be performed.

6.2 Duration of Study  
 
6.2.1 Planned Duration for the Study as a  Whole  
The study will be considered completed when a minimum of 24 subjects have at least one 
documented bleeding episode. The study as a whole should be completed within 5 years.  
The estimated start of the study (enrolment of first subject) is in the 4th quarter of 2014, and the estimated end of the study (last visit of last subject) is in the 4th quarter of 2019.  
 
6.2.2 Planned Duration for an Individual  Subject  
 
For subjects receiving on -demand treatment,  
• the individual subje ct observation and follow -up period for each documented episode 
starts with the first dose of Octafibrin administered for on -demand treatment of an acute 
bleeding episode (Day 1) and will be followed for up to Day 30. 
• Each subject’s treatment observation period is defined according to the severity of the 
event and will last at least 3 days for minor and 7 days for major bleeding  episodes.  
 
For subjects undergoing surgical prophylaxis,  
• the surgical observation period starts with the first dose of Octafibrin administered prior 
to elective surgery (Day 1) and, depending on the severity of the event, will  last  at least  3 post -operative days for minor and 7 post -operative days for major surgeries or until the 
day of the last post -operative infusion, whichever comes last. 
During the study observation period, enrolled patients will be treated for any bleeding epi - 
sodes or planned surgeries that can be managed under the protocol. Patients may remain in the study until the 24th patient has at least one documented bleeding episode. 
As many bleeding episodes or surgeries as possible occurring throughout the study 
observation period will be documented. Only the first bleeding episodes will be used for the analysis of the primary endpoint (see Section 3.1.1). All bleed ing episodes documented in the 
study will be assessed as a secondary endpoint (see Section  3.1.2). 
Patients who were screened for the study but do not present with a bleeding episode or planned surgery during the study observation period will be considered ‘no treatment’ 
patients.

6.2.3 Premature Termination of the  Study  
Both the investigator and the Sponsor reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. 
Should this be necessary, the procedures will be arranged on an individual study ba sis after 
review and consultation by both parties. In terminating the study, the Sponsor and the investigator will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ interests.  
Furthermore, the investigator should promptly infor m the Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) and provide a detailed written explanation. The pertinent regulatory authorities should be informed according to national regulations.  
Early termination of the study as a whole or ce ntre-wise may apply for the following reasons:  
• Clinical Study: At any time the study as a whole may be terminated prematurely if new 
toxicological or pharmacological findings or serious adverse events (SAEs) invalidate the earlier positive benefit -risk-assessment.  
• Study Centre: At any time the study may be terminated at an individual study centre  if: 
− The centre cannot comply with the requirements of the  protocol. 
− The centre cannot comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards.  
− The required recruitment rate is not met. 
Should the study be prematurely terminated, al l study materials (completed, partially 
completed, and blank CRFs, IMPs etc.) must be returned to the Sponsor.

7 ASSESSMENTS AND  METHODS  
 
7.1 Background and Screening Information  
The following information will be captured on at screening:  
Demographics : sex, age, weight and height (calculated body mass index), and ethnic origin.  
Medical history : obtained by interviewing the subject/legal guardian and by performing a 
physical examina tion. 
Previous and concomitant medication: obtained by interviewing the subject.  
 
 
7.2 Efficacy  Assessments  
7.2.1 Assessments for Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the overall clinical assessment of the haemostatic efficacy of  
Octafibrin in treating the first documented bleeding episode of each patient.  
• The first bleeding episode covers the time period from the first Octafibrin infusion 
until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the last infusion or the end of the treatment observation 
period, whichever comes  last. 
• The investigator’s overall clinical assessment covers the entire time period of the first 
bleeding episode as defined above. The assessment includes the clinical condition of the 
subject, laboratory values such as haematocrit and haemoglobin, as wel l as any 
additional haemostatic  treatments.  
The investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy will be based on a 4-point haemostatic efficacy scale (Table 2). The final efficacy assessment of each patient  
will be adjudicated by the  IDMEAC.  
 
Table 2: Overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy  
Category  Definition 
 
Excellent  Immediate and complete cessation of bleeding in the absence of other 
haemostatic intervention as clinically assessed by the treating physician;  and/or  
<10% drop in haemoglobin compared to pre -infusion.  
Good  Eventual complete cessation of bleeding in the absence of other haemostatic 
intervention as clinically assessed by the treating physician; and/or <20% drop in 
haemoglobin compared to pre-infusion.  
Moderate Incomplete cessation of bleeding and additional haemostatic intervention 
required, as clinically assessed by the treating physician; and/or between 20 and 25% drop in haemoglobin compared to pre-infusion.  
None No cessation of bleeding and alternative haemostatic intervention required, as clinically assessed by the treating physician; and/or >25% drop in haemoglobin  
  compared to  pre-infusion.

7.2.2 Assessments for Secondary Efficacy  Endpoints  
 
7.2.2.1 Clot Strength 
MCF will be determined using thromboelastography (TEG) and will be used as a surrogate 
marker for haemostatic efficacy. TEG is a method for the continuous measurement of clot formation and clot firmness. It utilises a mechanical detection system which is b ased on the 
ability of the blood or plasma clot to form a mechanical coupling over a distance of 1 mm.  
TEG is the continuous registration of blood clot firmness during the entire coagulation process (Figure 1). 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Example of thromboelastogram  
MCF (measured in mm) is a functional parameter which depends on the activation of coagulation, the platelet and fibrinogen content of the blood sample, and the polymerisation and cross -linking of the fibrin network. 
TEG has been shown in various studies to be predictive of clinical coagulopathy [16, 17, 18, 
19, 20]. TEG has been used as a functional marker for the assessment of fibrinogen content, and for the effects of fibrinogen supplementation on the clinical effica cy [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 
26]. Therefore, the MCF parameter is regarded as an adequate surrogate marker for the haemostatic efficacy of fibrinogen supplementation in patients with congenital fibrinogen deficiency.  
To obtain consistent results across all study centres, with minimal centre- to-centre variability, 
MCF data will be forwarded to the central laboratory. MCF will be assessed from frozen citrated plasma samples.  
The MCF (units: mm) at 1 hour post -infusion wi ll be regarded as surrogate efficacy criterion.

7.2.2.2 Recovery  
IVR will be determined using the following approaches:  
• Incremental IVR (response): calculated as the maximum increase in plasma fibrinogen 
(i.e., Clauss data) between pre -infusion  and 1 and 3 hours post -infusion (expressed as 
absolute concentration in plasma [mg/dL]), divided by the exact dose of Octafibrin 
(expressed as mg/kg dosed).  
• Classical IVR:  calculated as the maximum increase in plasma fibrinogen (i.e., Clauss 
data) between  pre-infusion and 1 and 3 hours post -infusion (expressed as absolute 
concentration in plasma [mg/dL]), divided by the total dose of Octafibrin per expected 
plasma volume (expressed as mg/dL), with expected plasma volume being estimated based on the blood volume formula described by Nadler  [27].  
 
7.2.2.3 Surgical  Prophylaxis  
The efficacy of Octafibrin in surgical prophylaxis will be assessed at the end of surgery by the 
surgeon and post -operatively by the haematologist as described in Table 3. The efficacy of 
Octafibrin in surgical prophylaxis will be based on an overall assessment. The overall surgical 
efficacy will be adjudicated by the IDMEAC who will evaluate the surgeons’ and investigators’ assessments in conjunction with a review of the surgical case.  
 
Table 3: Clinical assessment of surgical prophylaxis

Intra -operative efficacy as assessed by surgeon (at end of the surgery = after last suture)  
Excellent  Intra -operative blood loss* was lower than or equal to the average expected blood 
loss for the type of procedure performed in a subject with normal haemos tasis 
and of the same sex, age, and  stature.  
Good  Intra -operative blood loss* was higher than average expected blood loss but 
lower or equal to the maximal expected blood loss for the type of procedure in a 
subject with normal  haemostasis.  
Moderate Intra -operative blood loss* was higher than maximal expected blood loss for the 
type of procedure performed in a subject with normal haemostasis, but haemostasis was controlled.  
None Haemostasis was uncontrolled necessitating a change in clotting factor replacement  regimen.  
 
*All excludes unexpected blood loss due to surgical complications, i.e.,  
– direct injury of a vessel (artery or  vein)  
– vessel injury not adequately responding to routine surgical procedures achieving haemostasis

Post-operative efficacy as assessed by haematologist  
 
Excellent  No post -operative bleeding or oozing that was not due to complications of 
surgery. All post -operative bleeding (due to complications of surgery) was 
controlled with Octafibrin as anticipated for the type of  procedure.  
Good  No post -operative bleeding or oozing that was not due to complications of 
surgery. Control of post -operative bleeding due to complications of surgery 
required increased dosing with Octafibrin or additional infusions, not originally 
anticipated for the type of  procedure.  
Moderate Some post -operative bleeding and oozing that was not due to complications of 
surgery; control of post -operative bleeding required increased dosing with 
Octafibrin or additional infusions, not originally anticipated for the type of 
procedure.  
None Extensive  uncontrolled post -operative bleeding and oozing. Control of post - 
operative bleeding required use of an alternate fibrinogen concentrate.  
 
 
 
In addition, the location, severity, and type of s urgery will be documented. Expected and 
actual duration of surgical procedure and details of administered dose(s) of Octafibrin (pre-, 
intra- and/or post -operatively) will be recorded. Fibrinogen plasma levels (pre -, intra -, and 
post-operatively) will be m easured. Details of concomitantly administered products (except 
standard anaesthesia), along with a brief narrative describing the outcome of the intervention, 
will be recorded.

All remaining serum and plasma volumes will be labelled and stored as retention samples at 
the central laboratory for at least 24 months after the completion of the study and until Octapharma’s written authorisation to destroy these samples. These samples may be used for 
additional coagulation and viral testing, if needed. 
In addition, a urine or blood pregnancy test for all female subjects of childbearing potential 
will be performed before the first IMP infusion in each treatment episode (on -demand or 
surgery).  
The flow chart of assessments for on -demand treatment is provided on page xxi. The flow 
chart of assessments for surgical prophylaxis is provided on page xxii.  
 
7.3.1 Blood  Sampling  
The actual time of blood sampling must be recorded in the CRF and on the c orresponding 
laboratory requisition forms.  
If several blood samples have to be taken at one time point, the blood sampling will be done in the following  sequence:  
1. Coagulation (citrated  plasma)  
2. Haematology and virology serology (EDTA blood and serum, respec tively)  
3. Clinical chemistry  (serum)  
 
7.3.2 Citrated  Plasma  
Blood samples taken for plasma will be centrifuged after collection as instructed in the laboratory manual provided by the Sponsor. Aliquots of the supernatant are subsequently transferred into the tubes provided by the Sponsor and stored or shipped under conditions described in the laboratory  manual.  
For the analysis performed in the central laboratory, samples of citrated blood will be collected for coagulation factor analysis and antibody testing. After collection and centrifugation as instructed in laboratory manual, the plasma will be aliquoted into cryo - 
resistant tubes. Samples will be stored frozen  and shipped to the central laboratory on  dry-ice. 
For analyses performed locally, citrated blood as required by the local laboratory will be collected and  processed in accordance with local requirements.  
Retention samples will be taken at described time points in the study for possible retesting if needed.  
 
7.3.3 EDTA Blood  
A sample of EDTA blood will be collected for the measurement of haematology parameters (red blood cell count, RBCC; white blood cell count, WBCC; haemoglobin, HB; haematocrit, 
HCT; and platelet count, PC).  
All tests will be done at the local laboratory.

7.3.4 Serum  
For the determination of clinical chemistry (total bilirubin, BILI; alanine aminotransferase, 
ALT; aspartate aminotransferase, AST; blood urea nitrogen, BUN; serum creatinine, CREA; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), a serum blood sample will be collected.  
All tests will be done at the local laboratory.  
Retention samples will be taken at entry into the study and at the Study Completion Visit for potential viral testing if there is a suspicion of infection.  
 
7.3.5 Recording of Clinically Significant Abnormal Labora tory Values as  AEs/ADRs  
The investigator must assess the clinical significance of abnormal laboratory values outside the normal range as specified by the reference laboratory. Any clinically significant abnormalities should be fully investigated.  
Only laboratory abnormalities that have been rated as being clinically significant will be documented as AEs/ADRs. Clinically significant is defined as any laboratory abnormality that the investigator feels is of clinical concern and/or requires medical interventio n and/or follow - 
up. Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or aetiology of an abnormal result or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained if clinically indicated.  
Any abnormal laboratory value that persists should be followed until resolution or for 14 days after the Study Completion Visit, whichever occurs first. Preferably, clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should be medically diagnosed and entered as a diagnosis into the AE form.  
 
7.4 Safety  Assessments 
Any of the following drug safety information shall be collected:  
• All AEs occurring between the start of the first Octafibrin infusion and the end of each 30-
day observation and follow -up period for on- demand treatment or until the Last Post-  
Operat ive Day in surgeries will be  recorded.  
• All SAEs occurring after the first Octafibrin infusion will be documented and reported for 
a patient throughout the duration of the patient’s participation in the study or as required 
to meet local regulations (definitions and reporting requirements, see Section  7.4.1). 
• Post study related safety repor ts, pregnancies, drug overdose, interaction, abuse, misuse, 
or medication error (see Section  7.7).

7.4.1 Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
7.4.1.1 Definitions  
• AE: An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject receiving an IMP  
and which does not ne cessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not related to th e IMP.  
• Adverse drug reaction (ADR) : An ADR is any noxious and unintended response to an 
IMP related to any dose. The phrase ‘response to an IMP’ means that a causal relationship between the IMP and an AE carries at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the  
relationship cannot be ruled  out. 
• Other significant AEs : Any marked laboratory abnormalities or any AEs that lead to an 
intervention, including withdrawal of drug treatment, dose reduction or significant 
additional concomitant  therapy.  
• Withdrawal due to AE/ADR : Subject whose treatment with IMP is discontinued 
because of an AE or ADR. Any such events will be followed up by the investigator until 
the event is resolved or until the medical condition of the subject is stable. All follow -up 
information collected will be made available to the  Sponsor.  
 
7.4.1.2 Collection of AEs  
The condition of the subject will be monitored throughout each 30- day observation and 
follow -up period for on -demand treatment or each surgical observation period for surgical 
interventions. At each visit, whether scheduled or unscheduled, AEs will be elicited using a 
standard non- leading question such as ‘How have you been since the last visit?’  
Only AEs or ADRs which occur during any 30 -day observation and follow -up period for on-  
demand treatment or any surgical observation period for surgical interventions will be recorded in detail on the appropriate pages of the CRF. If the subject reports several signs or symptoms which represent a single syndrome or diagnosis, the latter s hould be recorded in the 
CRF.  
The investigator responsible will grade the severity of all AEs or ADRs (mild, moderate, or severe; see Section 7.4.1.3), the seriousness (non- serious or serious; see Section 7.5), and 
causality (see Section 7.4.1.4). The Sponsor is responsible to assess the expectedness of each ADR (expected or unexpected; see Section 7.4.1.5). 
In the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, the tests will be repeated 
and followed up until they have returned to normal and/ or an adequate explanation is 
available.  
Diseases, signs and symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing before the first administration of IMP are not considered as AEs when observed at a later stage unless they represent an exacerbation in intensity or frequency (worsening). 
The investigator responsible should always provide detailed information concerning any 
abnormalities and the nature of, and reasons for any necessary action(s), as well as any other  
Study Protocol 
No. FORMA -02 CONFIDENTIAL  Version 6.0  
31-Oct-2014  
Page 41  
  
observations or com ments, which are useful for the interpretation and understanding of the 
subjects’ AEs or ADRs.  
 
7.4.1.3 Severity of  AEs 
The intensity/severity of all AEs will be graded as follows:  
• Mild: an AE, usually transient, which causes discomfort but does not interfere with the 
subject’s routine  activities.  
• Moderate:  an AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with the subject’s 
routine  activities.  
• Severe:  an AE which is incapacitating a nd prevents the pursuit of the subject’s routine 
activities.  
Grading of an AE is up to the medical judgement of the investigator and will be decided on a 
case- by-case basis.  
 
7.4.1.4 Causality of AEs  
The relationship of AEs to the administered IMP will be assessed  by the investigator 
responsible:  
• Probable:  reports including good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a 
causal relationship, in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely, but not necessarily highly probable. A reaction that follows a reasonab le temporal sequence from 
administration of the IMP; or that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected medicine; or that is confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of the medicine and that could not reasonably be explained by known characteristics of the 
subject’s clinical  state.  
• Possible:  reports containing sufficient information to accept the possibility of a causal 
relationship, in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the connection is uncertain or doubtful, for  example because of missing data or insufficient evidence. A 
reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected medicine; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other  factors.  
• Unlikely: reports not following a reasonable temporal sequence from IMP 
administration. An event which may have been produced by the subject’s clinical state 
or by environmental factors or other therapies  administered.  
• Not related (unrelated): events for which suff icient information exists to conclude that 
the aetiology is unrelated to the  IMP.  
• Unclassified:  reports which for one reason or another are not yet assessable, e.g., 
because of outstanding information (can only be a temporary assessment).  
 
7.4.1.5 Classification of ADRs  
ADRs will be classified by the Sponsor as either expected or unexpected:  
• Expected:  an AE  that is listed in the current edition of the Investigator’s  Brochure.  
• Unexpected:  an AE that is not listed in the current edition of the Investigator’s 
Brochure, or that differs because of greater severity or greater  specificity.

7.4.1.6 Outco me of  AEs 
The outcome of all reported AEs has to be documented as follows:  
1. Recovered,  resolved.  
2. Recovering, resolving.  
3. Not recovered, not  resolved.  
4. Recovered, resolved with  sequelae.  
5. Fatal.  
6. Unknown.  
 
NOTE: A subject’s death per se is not an event, but an outcome. The event which resulted 
into subject’s death must be fully documented and reported, even in case the death occurs 
within 4 weeks after IMP treatment end, and without respect of being considered treatment - 
related or not.  
 
7.4.1.7 Action(s) Taken  
AEs requiring action or therapy must be treated with recognised standards of medical care to protect the health and well being of the subject. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicines must be available to ensure the best pos sible treatment of an emergency situation.  
The action taken by the investigator must be documented:  
1. In general:  
− None.  
− Medication (other than IMP) or other (e.g., physical) therapy started.  
− Test performed.  
− Other (to be  specified).  
2. Regarding the  IMP:  
− None. 
− Product  withdrawn. 
− Dose  reduced. 
− Dose  increased.  
The responsible investigator will follow -up each AE until it is resolved or until the medical 
condition of the subject is stable; all relevant follow -up information will be reported to the 
Sponsor.

7.5 Serious Adverse Events  
All reported SAEs occurring after the first administration of IMP in the study will be 
documented and reported for a patient throughout the duration of the patient’s participation in the study. This will be designated as occurring in either an “active peri od” (i.e., during the 
treatment observation and follow -up period) or an “inactive period” between treatment events 
(i.e., bleeding or surgery). 
All related concomitant medications will also be collected for these events.  
No SAEs will be collected between screening and the first treatment unless required by local 
regulations.  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in  death.  
• Is life-threatening.  
• Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation.  
• Results in persi stent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
• Is another important medical event.  
NOTE: The term ‘life -threatening’ refers to an event in which the subject was — in the view 
of the reporting investigator — at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
In other situations, medical judgement should be exercised in deciding whether an AE/ADR is serious: Important AEs/ADR s that are not immediately life -threatening or do not result in 
death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above, should also be considered serious. 
In addition, although not classified under the seriousness criteria, all suspected transmissions 
of an infectious agent should be reported as SAE. A suspected virus transmission means that virus antigen has been detected in the subject. A passive transmission  of antibodies alone does 
not constitute a suspected virus  transmission.  
 
7.5.1 SAE Reporting  Timelines  
All SAEs, whether suspected to be related to study treatment or not, are to be reported by telephone, fax or e -mail immediately to the Clinical Project Manager or designee. Contact 
details will be communicated at the study initiation visit.  
An Octapharma ‘ Serious Adverse Event Report’ must be completed  and submitted within   
24 hours after recognition of the  event. 
Study Protocol 
No. FORMA -02 CONFIDENTIAL  Version 6.0  
31-Oct-2014

In any case, all SAEs should also be reported to  
Octapharma’s Central Drug Safety Unit: 
OCTAPHARMA Pharmazeutika Produktions ges.m.b.H. 
Oberlaaer Strasse 235, 1100 Vienna, Austria  
Fax: +43 1 61032 9949 
E-mail: cdsu@octapharma.com  
24 hours emergency telephone number: +43 1 40 80 500 
 
Waiver from SAE expedited reporting requirement  
The following SAEs do not require expedited reporting:  
• Hospitalisation for the treatment of disease -related conditions assessed as unrelated to 
IMP treatment.  
• Prolongation of an existing hospitalization due to economic or social reasons, but not 
medical  reasons. 
 
7.6 Vital Signs and Physical  Examination  
Vital signs including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and 
body temperature should be recorded using standard clinical procedures at the study centres. 
Vital signs will be ass essed after 3 minutes of rest in the supine or semi -recumbent position.  
Physical examination will consist of checking the general appearance, skin condition, eyes, 
ears, nose and throat examination, heart auscultation, chest, breast and abdomen examination, neurological assessment, lymph node palpation, spine, and extremities examination.  
The flow chart of assessments for on -demand treatment is provided on page xxi. The flow 
chart of assessments for surgical prophylaxis is provided on page xxii.  
 
7.7 Other Rele vant Safety  Information  
 
7.7.1.1 Post-study Related Safety Reports  
Any ADR (i.e., any AE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP) which occurs after the completion of the study should be reported by the investigator. The usual procedure for reporting post marketing safety information should be followed, but relati on to the clinical 
study should be stated on the  report.  
If a subject/patient dies within 4 weeks after the last IMP administration, this should be reported as well, without being considered treatment related or not.  
Study Protocol 
No. FORMA -02 CONFIDENTIAL  Version 6.0

Page 45  
  
 
7.7.1.2 Pregnancies  
Every effort will be made to avoid a pregnancy during the use of an IMP.  
Pregnancies occurring after IMP treatment is initiated (foetal exposure to the IMP) need to be 
reported.  
In case of pregnancy during the study, the investigator is asked t o complete the pregnancy 
notification form and to send it (by fax) to the Clinical Project Manager or designee.  
Follow -up information on the outcome of both mother and foetus will be requested by a 
Sponsor representative.  
 
7.7.1.3 Overdose, Interaction, Misuse, Me dication Error and Lack of  Efficacy  
The following safety relevant information should be reported as an AE or, if the reaction fulfils one of the criteria for seriousness, as a SAE.  
• Drug overdose:  An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment 
at a dose higher than that specified in the protocol, and higher than the known therapeutic dose and of clinical relevance. The reaction must be clearly identified as an overdose.  
• Interaction:  A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance/medicinal product 
affects the activity of an IMP, i.e., the effects are increased or decreased, or they produce an effect that none of the products exhibits on its own. The reaction must be clearly identified as drug  interaction.  
• Misuse:  Misuse is the deliberate administration or use of the medicinal product outside 
its described indication or outside the current state of the art medical practice (off -label - 
use). The reaction must be clearly  identified as  misuse.  
• Medication error: Medication error involves the inadvertent administration or 
unintended use of a medicinal product which may be caused by the naming, presentation of pharmaceutical form/packaging, and/or instructions for use/labelli ng. 
The reaction must be clearly identified as a medication  error.  
 
7.8 Other  Assessments 
Not applicable.  
 
7.9 Appropriateness of Measurements  
The clinical and laboratory measurements used to assess the efficacy and safety of Octafibrin are generally accepted and in accordance with published recommendations. All laboratory parameters will be evaluated by accredited laboratory facilities using standardised and validated methods.  
The key laboratory investigations of the study (Clauss assay, fibrinogen specific enzyme  
linked immunosorbent assay, and MCF) will be performed by a central laboratory specialised in the determination of coagulation parameters.

8 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD  KEEPING 
 
8.1 Source Data and  Records  
Source data are defined as all the information related to clinical findings, observations, or 
other activities in the study, written down in original records or certified copies of original records allowing reconstruction and evaluation of the clinical stu dy. 
The investigator will maintain adequate source records (e.g., case histories or subject files for each subject enrolled). Source records should be preserved for the maximum period of time required by local regulations. 
For each subject enrolled, the in vestigator will indicate in the source record(s) that the subject 
participates in this study.  
All data entered in the CRF must be supported by source data in the subject records with the 
exceptions listed in Section 8.2. 
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audit(s), IEC/IRB review(s) and 
regulatory inspection(s), by providing direct access to source data/records. The investigator may authorise site staff (e.g., sub- investigators, nurses) to enter study data 
into the CRF. This must be documented in the ‘Delegation of Authority Log,’, filled in and 
signed by the investigator responsible. 
 
8.2 Case Report Forms  
For each subject enrolled, a CRF will be completed. The Principal Investigator or authorised 
investiga tors will sign the CRF as required on the forms.  
All forms will be filled out using an indelible (black or blue) pen, and must be legible. The 
following data will be recorded directly on the CRFs, without prior written or electronic record of source data, turning the CRF into  source:  
• Vital signs.  
• Physica l examination  results.  
• Date and time of blood sampling.  
 
8.3 Changes to Case Report Form  Data  
Errors occurring in CRFs will be crossed out without obscuring the original entry, the correction will be written alongside the initial entry, and the change will be initialled and dated by the investigator or authorised study site personnel. When changes to CRF data are necessary following removal of the original CRF from the study site, any such changes will  be documented on data clarification/resolution forms, whic h will be submitted to the 
investigator for signature. 
Study Protocol 
No. FORMA -02 CONFIDENTIAL  Version 6.0  
31-Oct-2014  
Page 47  
  
If reason for the change is not obvious, then a reason should be given. The Principal 
Investigator must, as a minimum, sign the final CRF page to attest the accuracy and completeness  of all the data. Once the data have been entered onto the database, they will be 
checked and any discrepancies will be raised and returned to the investigator for resolution. Data will be monitored and tabulated in accordance with the Data Management Plan . 
Once queries have been resolved by the site staff, the resolutions are assessed by Data Management for incomplete or ambiguous resolutions. If the query response provided confirms the data as correct, the discrepancy will be closed based on the query response. If the response does not adequately address the question raised, a new query will be issued for further clarification.  
Manual checks are performed and programs are run throughout the study until the data is clean and the database is ready for lock. All discrepancies will be resolved prior to database lock. There will be a final run of the programmed checks to ensure all discrepancies are closed out, source data verification will be confirmed as complete by the monitor, and all CRFs and resolved data discrepancies will be approved by the investigator prior to database lock.  
 
8.4 Information of  Investigators  
An Investigator’s Brochure will be handed out to the investigator before the start of the study. This Brochure contains all information in the Sponsor’s possession necessary for the investigator to be fully and accurately informed about the safety of the I MP under evaluation 
and the respective benefit -risk ratio.  
The Investigator’s Brochure will be updated by the Sponsor at regular intervals and in case new information concerning the IMP becomes available.  
The investigators will be informed about the method s for rating relevant study outcomes and 
for completing CRFs in order to reduce discrepancies between participating investigators and study sites.  
The investigator will be kept informed of important data that relate to the safe use of the IMP as the study proceeds.  
 
8.5 Responsibilities  
The investigator is accountable for the conduct of the clinical study. If any responsibilities are 
delegated, the investigator should maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom 
he/she has delegated significant st udy-related duties.  
A Delegation of Authority Log will be filled in and signed by the investigator responsible. In accordance with this authority log study site staff (e.g., sub- investigators, nurses) is  
authorized to perform study related tasks and to enter specific data into the CRF.

8.5.1 Co-ordinating  Investigator  
The co -ordinating investigator of this study is: 
Flora Peyvandi MD, PhD  
Associate Professor of Internal Medicine,  
A. Bianchi Bonomi Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center, 
University of Milan,  
Department of Medicine and Medical Specialties, IRCCS Maggiore Hospital,  
Mangiagalli and Regina Elena Foundation, Milan, Italy  
 
8.5.2 External  Parties  
Central laboratory testing, monitoring , data management, and biostatistics will be delegated 
under an agreement of transfer of responsibilities to a central laboratory or an external Contract Research organisation (CRO).  
All Octapharma procedures and policies have to be met by external parties (CROs and central 
laboratories), discrepancies or exceptions are to be approved by Octapharma. All parties involved in the study are responsible to comply with local and international obligations, regulatory requirements and duties in accordance with loca l laws, GCP guidelines, SOPs and 
other applicable regulations. 
 
8.6 Investigator’s Site  File 
At each study site, the investigator is responsible for maintaining all records to enable the 
conduct of the study to be fully documented. Essential documents as requi red by GCP 
guidelines and regulations (e.g., copies of the protocol, study approval letters, all original 
informed consent forms, site copies of all CRFs, drug dispensing and accountability logs, correspondence pertaining to the study, etc.) should be file d accurately and kept by the 
investigator for the maximum period of time required by local regulations.  
The investigator is responsible for maintaining a confidential subject identification code list, which provides the unique link between named source records and CRF data for the Sponsor. The investigator must arrange for the retention of this confidential list for the maximum period of time required by local  regulations.  
No study document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the investigator and the Sponsor. Should the investigator elect to assign the study documents to another party, or move them to another location, the Sponsor must be notified in writing.

8.7 Provision of Additional  Information  
On request, the investigator will supply the Sponsor with additional data relating to the study, 
or copies of relevant source records, ensuring that the subject’s confidentiality is maintained. This is particularly important when CRFs are illegible or when errors in data transcription are encountered. In case of particular issues or governmental queries, it is also necessary to  have 
access to the complete study records, provided that the subject’s confidentiality is protected in accordance with applicable regulations.  
 
8.8 Independent Data Monitoring & Endpoint Adjudication Committee  
An Independent Data Monitoring & Endpoint Adjudic ation Committee (IDMEAC) will be 
established by the Sponsor. The IDMEAC will be composed of recognised experts in the field of clinical care who are not actively recruiting subjects.  
The IDMEAC will review relevant data periodically during the study and wi ll give advice on 
the continuation, modification, or termination of the study. This committee will also be responsible for adjudicating the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in the study. 
A IDMEAC charter will define in detail the composition, respo nsibilities and procedures of 
the IDMEAC.

9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE  SIZE  
 
9.1 Hypothesis Testing and Determination of Sample  Size 
The following hypothesis will be tested:  
H0: p ≤ 0.7  
against the alternative  
HA: p > 0.7 
where p is the proportion of subjects with successful haemostatic efficacy (i.e., ‘excellent’ or 
‘good’).  
The null hypothesis will be tested against the alternative by comparing the lower limit of the 
two-sided 90% Blyth- Still- Casella confidence interval for the proportion of patients with 
successful haemostatic efficacy with the predefined threshold of 0.7.  
The number of subjects is limited by the very small number of patients with this indication. 
Therefore, no real sample size estimation is provided. Instead, the probabilities for different outcomes are provided, given a success rate of 90% for a total number of 24 subjects together with respective confidence intervals (CIs).  
Assuming that haemostatic treatment is successful (i.e., ‘excellent’ or ‘good’) in 90% of the 24 subjects, the success rates and probabilities given in Table 5 will  apply.  
 
Table 5: Overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy  
 
Outcome

≥22/24  ≥91.7%  0.564  0.779 – 0.978  
n = number of subjects with ‘excellent’ and ‘good’ haemostatic efficacy; N = total number of subjects.  
a Blyth -Still- Casella interval [28], realised by SAS software [29].  
Hence, assuming that treatment with Octafibrin is associated with a true success rate of 90% 
of the 24 subjects, there will be a 78.6% probability that at least 21 of 24 subjects will have a 
successful assessment. In case of 21 successful assessments, the lower boundary of the 90% CI will be 0.718, i.e. >70%.  
For the purpose of analysis, t he efficacy assessment made by the investigator on the 4 -point 
rating scale (see Section 7.2.1) will be transformed to a dichotomous endpoint, with ‘treatment success—yes’ defined as a rating of ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ and ‘treatment success — 
no’ defined as a rating of ‘moderate,’ ‘none,’ or a missing rating. The success rate will be 
calculated as the proportion of patients with treatment success.

9.2 Statistical  Analysis  
The primary endpoint is the overall clinical assessment of haemostatic ef ficacy in acute 
bleeding, covering the time period from the first Octafibrin infusion until 24 hours (i.e.,          
1 day) after the last infusion or the end of the treatment observation period, whichever comes 
last (see Section  3.1.1).  
In addition to the inferential evaluation of the success rate described in the preceding section, the haemostatic efficacy scale data will be presented descriptively by means of frequency counts and percentages.  
The statistical analysis of safety variables will be descriptive only.  
Continuous variables will be summarised using descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, Standard Deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum, and number of observations and missing observations). Categorical variables will be summarised with counts and percentages.  
Data will also be presented as bar and line graphs.  
A formal statistical analysis plan describing all details of the analyses to be performed will be prepared by the study statistician and approved by the Sponsor prior to the start of the statistical analysis.  
 
9.3 Populations for Analysis  
 
9.3.1 Safety  Population  
The safety population will include all subjects who received at least one infusion of the IMP. 
The analysis of safety will be based on this population.  
 
9.3.2 Full Analysis  Set 
The full analysis set defined according to the intention -to-treat (ITT) principle will include 
subjects who fulfil all of the following conditions: 
• Received at least one infusion of the  IMP.  
• Entered the study with a confirmed congenital fibrinogen deficiency (second inclusion criterion; see Section  4.2). 
• Presented with an episode of acute bleeding (third inclusion criterion; see Section  4.2). 
• And/or plan to undergo a surgical procedure with a need for at least one infusion of the IMP during the time period from the day of surgery until overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy (third inclusion criterion; see Section  4.2).

The per -protocol (PP) population will include all subjects of the full analysis set who fulfil all 
of the following conditions:  
• Provide valid, i.e., non- missing haemostatic efficacy  data.  
• Provide a 1- hour post -infusion MCF  value.  
• Received ≥90% of the planned total dose of the IMP in the first  infusion.  
• Received ≥80% of the calculated dose  (no dose was calculated, 0% will be assumed) of 
the IMP over all further infusions according to the treatment schedule  
• Did not meet any of the following exclusion criteria:  
– Bleeding disorder other than congenital fibrinogen deficiency.  
– End-stage liver disease (i.e., Child -Pugh- score B or  C). 
– Suspicion of an anti -fibrinogen inhibitor as indicated by previous IVR, if  available  
<0.5 (mg/dL)/(mg/kg).  
– Treatment with any fibrinogen concentrate or other fibrinogen -containing blood 
product within 2 weeks prior to start of treatment for the bleeding ep isode or 
surgery.  
• Did not use any coagulation -active drug (i.e., non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, 
warfarin, coumarin derivatives, platelet aggregation inhibitors) within 1 week prior to 
start of treatment for the bleeding episode or surgery, or as a planned or expected medication during the time period from Day 1 until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the last Octafibrin  infusion.  
• Surgical procedure with a need for at least one infusion of the IMP with an overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy.  
Any protocol deviations other than those with respect to the above conditions for the PP population must be agreed upon in writing by the Sponsor and the study statistician, and in any case, before database closure.  
The efficacy analysis will be performed for bleeding events using the full analysis set (ITT analysis) and for the PP population (PP analysis). An additional analysis will also be performed for the surgical population. 
 
9.3.4 Subpopulations  
Subpopulations based on the following categories will be examined:  
• Severity of bleeding: minor versus  major.  
• Age: Paediatric (≤18 years) versus adult (18–64) versus elderly patients ( ≥65), if 
appropriate.  
• Sex.

9.4 Efficacy Analysis Plan  
 
9.4.1 Primary  Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy of Octafibrin 
in treating the first documented bleeding episode of each patient. The first bleeding episode covers the time period from the first Octafibrin infusion until 24 hours (i.e., 1 day) after the 
last infusion or the end of the treatment observation period, whichever comes last (see Section 3.1.1). 
Frequency distribution will be provided for the haemostatic efficacy scale data. In addition, a 
90% CI for the success rate in haemostatic efficacy (excellent or good) according to Casella (Blyth -Still-Casella interval [28]) will be computed using SAS soft ware [29]. 
For the following subjects, the haemostatic efficacy outcome will be set to the worst efficacy category, i.e., ‘none’:  
• Subjects who withdraw from the study due to lack of  efficacy.  
• Subjects receiving cryoprecipitate or concentrates containing fibrinogen other than the IMP between first infusion and efficacy assessment (unless it is clearly documented that these products were administered for reasons unrelated to IMP efficacy [e.g., p harmacy 
error]).  
• Subjects with missing haemostatic efficacy  assessment.  
Haemostatic efficacy will be displayed by covariables (sex, age groups, weight, type of bleeding) in tables or with covariables in listings depending on the number per subgroup. 
 
9.4.2 Secon dary  Endpoints  
 
9.4.2.1 Clot strength  (MCF)  
MCF before the first infusion and 1 hour after the end of the first and last infusion as well as changes of MCF from pre -infusion will be summarised using descriptive statistics and 
displayed graphically. The course of l aboratory data will be presented graphically. Mean 
changes in MCF will be described with 2 -sided 95% CIs.  
The same analyses will be performed separated for the predefined subgroups as well as separated for the subjects’ clinical outcome represented by each step of the 4 -point 
haemostatic efficacy scale (excellent, good, moderate, none) and the dichotomised haemostatic efficacy scale (excellent/good, moderate/none). Scatterplots will show MCF by 
haemostatic efficacy  outcome.  
In addition, a correlation analysis between MCF and the haemostatic efficacy assessment will be performed. To evaluate the correlation betw een MCF and the primary efficacy variable, 
Spearman correlation coefficients will be estimated for the correlation of the 4 -point 
haemostatic efficacy with MCF and with MCF change.  
NOTE: If there is almost no variation in haemostatic efficacy outcomes (e.g ., if almost all of 
the outcomes are ‘excellent’) there will be only low discriminatory power to show an association between MCF and haemostatic efficacy.

9.4.2.2 In-vivo recovery  
IVR will be determined using incremental and classical IVR (see S ection 7.2.2.2). Calculation 
and analysis of IVR will be performed for the Clauss method only.  
Response (incremental IVR) will be calculated as the maximum increase in plasma 
fibrinogen (i.e., Clauss data) between pre -infusion and 1 and 3 hours post -infusi on (expressed 
as absolute concentration in plasma [mg/dL]), divided by the exact dose of Octafibrin 
(expressed as mg/kg dosed):  
 
Incremental IVR (response) (mg/dL increase/[mg/kg b.w.]) =  
Maximum increase in fibrinogen plasma level 1 and 3 hours post -infus ion 
compared to pre -infusion (mg/dL) /  
(exact dose of component in IMP administered [mg]/b.w. [kg])  
 
Classical IVR will be calculated as the maximum increase in plasma fibrinogen (i.e., Clauss data) between pre -infusion and 1 and 3 hours post -infusion (expressed as absolute 
concentration in plasma [mg/dL]), divided by the total dose of Octafibrin per expected plasma 
volume (expressed as mg/dL, expected plasma volume being estimated based on the blood volume formula described by Nadler [27]):  
 
Classical IVR (%) =  
100% x actual/expected increase =  
100% x maximum increase in fibrinogen plasma level 1 and 3 hours post - 
infusion compared to pre -infusion (mg/dL) x plasma volume (dL) / (exact dose 
of component in IMP administered [mg]):  
∆ value  IU  
  IU / dL   dL  
IVR   =     
 IU / kg  dose 
(IU) body weight (kg)  
 
 
Response and classical IVR will be calculated for each infusion of each subject. Descriptive 
tables will show the distributions of the 2 parameters per infusion day separated for minor and major bleeding. An exploratory analysis using a repeated- measures analysis of covariance 
model will analyse whether the response/classical IVR changed over time. The dose (mg/kg) associated with the respective IVR will be held as covariate in the model. The response/IVR over time and dose will also be presented in scatter plots for all subjects and by major/minor bleeding.  
 
9.4.2.3 Efficacy of Octafibrin in all Bleeding  Episodes  
The efficacy of Octafibrin in the treatment of all bleeding episodes recorded throughout the 
study obse rvation period will be assessed in the same way as the efficacy of Octafibrin in the 
treatment of the first bleeding episode per patient (see Section 9.4.1)

9.4.2.4 Surgical  Prophylaxis  
Efficacy of Octafibrin in surgical prophylaxis will be assess ed intra -operatively (at the end of 
surgery = after last suture) by the surgeon and post -operatively by the haematologist using 
two 4 -point efficacy scales. In the event that any intra - or post -operative endpoint data differ 
between the investigator’s assessment and the adjudicated assessment by the IDMEAC, the 
endpoint will be that based on the adjudicated assessments. The efficacy of Octafibrin in 
surgical prophylaxis will be evaluated by descriptive statistics based on an overall  assessment.  
The IDMEAC will conduct an independent adjudication of all haemostatic efficacy results and adjudicate the investigator’s assessments of the intra - and post -operative assessments 
(‘secondary  adjudication’).  
The primary endpoint (‘success’ or ‘failure’) will be derived from the adjudicated intra - and 
post-operative assessments according to the agreed algorithm presented in Table 6.

adjudication  
Good  Success  Success  Primary adjudication  Failure  
Moderate  Success  Primary adjudication  Failure  Failure  
None  Primary

9.4.2.5 Safety Analysis  Plan  
The analysis of safety will be based on the safety population.  
All AEs (including events likely to be related to the underlying disease, or a concomitant 
illness or medication or clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory parameters or vital signs)  will be displayed in summary tables and listings.  
Incidences of AEs will be given as numbers and percentages of subjects with:  
• Any AE. 
• Any SAE.  
• Any AE probably or possibly related to the  IMP.  
• Any AE temporally related (within 24 hours after end of infusio n) to the  IMP.  
• Any severe  AE. 
• Any withdrawal due to AE. 
• Any AE by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term (descending  frequency).  
• Any AE temporally related (within 24 hours after end of infusion) by MedDRA preferred term (descending  frequency). 
• Any AE by MedDRA system organ class (SOC).  
• Any AE temporally related (within 24 hours after end of infusion) by MedDRA  SOC.  
Summary tables for AEs will be given by SOC and preferred term. Additionally, AEs will be summarised by severity and relationship to the IMP. 
The MedDRA coded terms and the co rresponding original (verbatim) terms used by the 
investigator will be listed.  
For laboratory variables (analyses of haematology, biochemistry, and thrombogenicity), the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be presented. Laboratory variables wi ll also 
be presented graphically. Intra -individual changes between pre- infusion and the respective 
post-infusion time points will be analysed using shift tables and graphical presentations. 
Physical examination data will be presented in frequency tables.

9.4.3 Additional  Analyses  
 
Octafibrin use  
Octafibrin will be individually dosed to achieve a recommended target fibrinogen plasma 
level dependent on the bleeding type (minor or major). Target level and achieved level after 
individual dosing as well as the difference between target level and achieved level will be summarized using descriptive statistics and displayed  graphically.  
The dose of the IMP used per day and in total will be summarised using descriptive statistics for minor and major b leeding events. Frequency of infusions and duration of treatment will 
also be summarised. The frequency of unscheduled infusions will be summarised descriptively.  
 
9.5 Handling of Missing  Data  
In general, if not stated differently, missing data will not be imputed.  
If the haemostatic efficacy assessment is missing, it will be set to ‘none’ in the ITT analysis. Subjects  with  missing  haemostatic  efficacy   assessment   will   be   excluded   f rom   the 
PP population. 
Missing MCF and IVR values will not be replaced.  
 
9.6 Randomisation  
Not applicable.  
 
9.7 Interim  Analysis 
An interim analysis will be performed after the data is available for the first bleeding episode 
of 10 subjects; 2 of these subjects should be between 12 and 18 years old. Results will be 
included in the submission for registration. Descriptive efficacy and safety analysis will be performed and presented to IDMEAC.

ASPECTS  
 
10.1 Ethical and Regulatory  Framework  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles laid down in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol and any subsequent amendment(s) will be submitted to an IEC/IRB and to the Regulatory Authority. The study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol, GCP regulations and applicable regulatory requirements. 
The regulatory application or submission for regulatory approval will be made by the Sponsor 
or designated third party (e.g., CRO), as required by national law. 
 
10.2 Appr oval of Study  Documents  
The study protocol, a sample of the subject information and informed consent form, any other materials provided to the subjects, and further requested information will be submitted by the Sponsor or the investigator to the appropria te IEC/IRB and the Regulatory Authority. The 
study approval letter must be available before any subject is exposed to a study- related 
procedure.  
The Sponsor, the investigator and any third party (e.g., CRO) involved in obtaining approval, must inform each other in writing that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first subject is enrolled in the study.  
 
10.3 Subject Information and Informed Consent  
At screening, the investigator will obtain a freely given written consent from each subject after an appropriate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards and any other aspect of the study which is relevant to the subject’s decision to participate. The informed consent form must be signed, with name and date and ti me noted by the subject and 
the investigator, before the subject is exposed to any study- related procedure, including 
screening tests for  eligibility.  
For subjects not qualified to give legal consent, written consent must be obtained from the legal parent/ guardian. If children are old enough to understand the risks and benefits of the 
study, they should also be informed and provide their written consent.  
If the period between screening and treatment is more than 3 months, informed consent will be reviewed and confirmed prior to treatment, and details of the review process will be recorded in the patient chart and indicated by the  investigator.  
The investigator will explain that the subjects are completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, without any consequences for their further care and 
without the need to justify. The investigator will complete the informed consent section of the CRF for each subject  enrolled.  
Study Protocol

Each subject will be informed that his/her medical (source) records may be reviewed by the 
study monitor, a quality assurance auditor or a health authority inspector, in accordance with applicable regulations, and that these persons are bound by confidenti ality obligations.  
 
10.4 Protocol  Amendments  
Any prospective change to the protocol will be agreed between the investigator (co- ordinating 
investigator in multi- centre studies) and the Sponsor prior to its implementation. Any such 
amendments will be submitted to the IEC(s/IRB) and/or competent authority responsible as required by applicable regulations. IEC(s)/IRB approval will at a minimum be requested for any change to this protocol which could affect the safety of the subjects, the objective/design of the stu dy, any increase in dosage or duration of exposure to the IMP an increase in the 
number of subjects treated, the addition of a new test or procedure, or the dropping of a test intended to monitor safety.  
 
10.5 Confidentiality of Subjects  Data  
The investigator w ill ensure that the subject’s confidentiality is preserved. On CRFs or any 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor, the subjects will not be identified by their names, but by a unique subject number. Documents not for submission to the Sponsor, i.e., the confidential subject identification code list, original consent forms and source records will be maintained by the investigator in strict confidence.

11 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
11.1 Periodic  Monitoring  
The monitor will contact an d visit the investigator periodically to review all study -related 
source data/records, verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, correctness 
and accuracy of all CRF entries compared to source data. The investigator will co -operate 
with the  monitor to ensure that any discrepancies identified are resolved.  
For this study, the first monitoring visit shall take place shortly after the start of treatment of the first subject. Thereafter, monitoring frequency will depend on study progress.  
The monitor must be given direct access to source documents (original documents, data and 
records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any 
records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the clinical stu dy. Source data will 
be available for all data in the CRFs, including all laboratory results.  
 
11.2 Audit and  Inspection  
The investigator will make all study -related source data and records available to a qualified 
quality assurance auditor mandated by the Sponsor, or to IEC/IRB/regulatory inspectors, after reasonable notice. The main purposes of an audit or inspection are t o confirm that the rights 
and welfare of the subjects have been adequately protected, and that all data relevant for the assessment of safety and effectiveness of the IMP have been reported to the Sponsor.

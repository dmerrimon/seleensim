DOCUMENT HISTORY
Document Date of Issue Overall Rationale
Amendment 05 19-OCT -2023 The study is being terminated based on the results 
of an interim analysis, which showed a lack of 
clinical benefit on overall survival (OS) of the of 
the pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib combination 
over pembrolizumab monotherapy. This 
amendment serves to inc orporate instructions for 
discontinuation of study intervention, appropriate 
measures for safety follow -up of ongoing study 
participants, and the plan for analysis of study 
data going forward .
Amendment 04 05-JUL-2022 Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. underwent an 
entity name and address change to Merck Sharp 
& Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, USA. This 
conversion resulted only in an entity name change 
and update to the address.
Amendment 03 28-MAY -2021 Global amendment to update the dose 
modification and toxicity management guidelines 
for irAEs. The protocol was also updated to 
comply with lenvatinib label requirements for 
osteonecrosis of the jaw, NG/G tube update, and 
FDA commitment to update imaging language.
Amendment 02 03-JUN-2020 To incorporate Health Authority feedback 
received to date, modify the driver of IA2, amend 
exclusion criteria to allow administration of 
lenvatinib suspension through a gastrostomy tube, 
add nonemergency unblinding to guide further 
treatment decisions of pa rticipants with centrally -
verified PD, remove iRECIST assessments, and 
provide program -level updates, corrections, and 
clarifications.
Amendment 01 25-OCT -2019 Removed anticoagulants, NSAIDS and aspirin 
from the list of prohibited medications within the 
Concomitant Therapy Section, as on -study use of

1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY
1.1 Synopsis
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind clinical study of 
pembrolizumab (MK -3475) with or without lenvatinib (E7080/MK -7902) to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib as 1L intervention in a PD -L1 selected 
population of participants with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) (LEAP -010).
Short Title: A Phase 3 study of pembrolizumab (MK -3475) with or without lenvatinib 
(E708 0/MK -7902) as 1L intervention in a PD -L1 selected population with R/M HNSCC 
(LEAP -010)
Acronym: LEAP -010
Hypotheses, Objectives, and Endpoints:
Hypotheses are aligned with objectives in the Objectives and Endpoints table.
Inmales and females who are at le ast 18 years old ,with a histologically confirmed diagnosis 
of R/M HNSCC that is biomarker positive ( combined positive score ( CPS ≥1)), and who are 
considered incurable by local therapies will be enrolled in this study.
Throughout this protocol, the term R ECIST 1.1 refers to the adjustment of RECIST 1.1 to 
include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Refer 
to Section 4.2.1.1.1 for further details.
NOTE: Based on the data from an interim safety and efficacy analysis for LEAP -010(data 
cutoff 30-May-2023 ),the study will be discontinued based on a lack of additional clinical 
benefit on overall survival ( OS)of the combination of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib over 
pembrolizumab monotherapy. At this interim analysis, the combination did not demonstrate 
an improvement in OS versus pembrolizumab alon e, and the likelihood of reaching the 
protocol specified threshold for statistical significance for OS at a future analysis was 
evaluated and deeme d to be low. Based upon these data, the study was unblinded on
16-Aug-2023 . The prespecified third interim analysis and final analysis of the study 
described in the SAP will not be performed. Safety analysis will be performed at the end of 
the study; there will be no further planned analyses for efficacy and ePRO endpoints.
NOTE: In alignment with the study -specific investigator letter dated 25 -Aug-2023 , all study 
participants still receiving pembrolizumab should continue to receive pembrolizumab 
monotherapy on study and undergo modified protocol study procedures as specified in this 
amendment. Study participation should end after the 30 -day Safety Follow -up Visit (last 
scheduled visit) with the following exceptions: participants who are potential candidates for 
Second Course treatment will continue in Efficacy Follow -up and all participants in China 
will continue in Efficacy Follow -up and Survival Follow -up.All participants should stop 
ongoing treatment with lenvatinib/placebo.

Excep tions may be requested for lenvatinib for study participants who, in the assessment of 
their study physician, are benefiting from ongoing lenvatinib after consulting with the 
Sponsor. This applies to participants currently on pembrolizumab and lenvatinib a nd 
participants who have discontinued pembrolizumab and are currently continuing lenvatinib 
monotherapy. Participants who are considered by the investigator as candidates for continued 
monotherapy with lenvatinib after completion of 35 cycles of pembrolizu mab and lenvatinib 
require a separate communication with the Sponsor. Participants who discontinue 
pembrolizumab prior to completion of Cycle 35 (eg, due to an AE) must discontinue 
lenvatinib at the same time.
All participants beyond the 30 -day Safety Foll ow-up Visit (except participants who are 
potential candidates for Second Course treatment and all participants in China) should be 
discontinued from the study; however standard safety reporting should continue, as 
applicable. As of Amendment 05, participan ts who are still on study treatment will no longer 
require ePRO assessments or tumor response assessments by BICR to be performed. Scans 
will no longer be submitted to the iCRO. (Note: tumor response assessments by BICR and 
submission of scans to the iCRO will continue for participants in China.) Participants who 
are still on study medication should continue tumor imaging and investigator assessments of 
imaging per protocol. Biomarker specimen collection is discontinued. The 30 -Day Safety 
Follow -up Vis it is the last required visit (except forparticipants who are potential candidates 
for Second Course treatment and allparticipants in China ). Updated analyses are described in 
Section 9.

Estimated Duration of Study The Sponsor estimates that the study will 
require approximately 60 months from the 
time the first participant (or their legally 
acceptable representative) provides 
documented informed consent until the last 
participant’s last study -related contact.
Number of Participants:
Approximately 500participants will be randomized .Randomization will be stratified 
according to: PD -L1 tumor expression as determined by PD -L1 IHC (TPS <50% vs. ≥50%); 
HPV status for oropharynx cancer as determined by p16 IHC (positive vs. negative); and 
ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1). All randomized participants are includ ed in the ITT 
analysis as described in Section 9. After enrollment of the global portion of the study is 
complete, the study may remain open to enrollment in China alone until the target number of 
participants in China has been enrolled to meet local regul atory requirements.

Total Number of Intervention Groups/Arms 2
Duration of Participation Each participant will participate in the study 
from the time the participant provides 
documented informed consent through the 
final protocol -specified contact.
After a screening phase of up to 42 days, 
each participant will be assigned to receive 
study intervention until disease progression 
is verified by BICR, unacceptable adverse 
events, intercurrent illness that prevents 
further administration of study treatment, 
investigator’s decision to discontinue the 
participant, or administrative reasons 
requiring cessation of treatment.
All participants receiving pembr olizumab 
will discontinue treatment with 
pembrolizumab after receiving 35 
administrations. Participants who stop 
pembrolizumab after 35 administrations for 
reasons other than disease progression or 
intolerability or participants who stop 
pembrolizumab afte r attaining a Complete 
Response may be eligible for up to 17 
additional administrations of 
pembrolizumab upon experiencing BICR -
verified disease progression (Section 6.7). 
Participants who are receiving 
lenvatinib/placebo at the time disease 
progression is verified may continue to 
receive lenvatinib/placebo during Second 
Course treatment at the discretion of the 
investigator. Participants who discontinue 
lenvatinib/placebo prior to initiation of 
Second Course treatment will not restart 
lenvatinib/placebo.
After the end of treatment, each participant 
will be followed for the occurrence of 
adverse events and spontaneously reported 
pregnancy as described under Section 8.4.

Participants who discontinue for reasons 
other than radiographic disease progression 
willhave post -treatment follow -up imaging 
for disease status until disease progression 
is documented per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, 
the start of a new anti -cancer treatment, 
withdrawal of consent, pregnancy, death, or 
loss to follow -up. All participants will be 
followed by telephone for overall survival 
until death, withdrawal of consent, or the 
end of the study.
Upon study termina tion, participants are to 
be discontinued and may be enrolled in an 
extension study using pembrolizumab in

Biomarker samples (blood for genetic analysis, RNA analysis, plasma/serum biomarker analysis, ctDNA analysis andstool samples) 
are discontinued.
All participants who are still on study medication should continue tumor imaging and investigator assessments of imaging per 
protocol. Tumor re sponse assessments by BICR will no longer be performed and s cans will no longer be sent to the iCRO. Note : 
BICR a ssessments and submission of scans to the iCRO will continue for all participants in China. 
Efficacy Follow -upvisits will only be conducted for participants who are potential candidates for Second Course treatment and for all 
participants in China .Survival Follow -up Visits will only be conducted for participants in China . 
Summary of changes in SoA:
Imaging: while still on treatment and during efficacy follow -up as de scribed above

2 INTRODUCTION
Pembrolizumab, a PD -1 inhibitor, in combination with lenvatinib, an anti -angiogenic 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, are being investigated for participants eligible for 1L treatment of 
R/M HNSCC in this randomized, international, parallel design, doub le-blind, Phase 3 study.
2.1 Study Rationale
Head and neck cancers describe an anatomically heterogeneous group of cancers that arise 
most often from the oral cavity, the oropharynx, the hypopharynx, and the larynx [Dorsey, K. 
2013] . More than 90% of head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, originating 
from the epithelium of the mucosal lining of the upper aerodigestive tract [Gupta, B., et al 
2016] . Head and neck cancers are the ninth most common mali gnancy in the world with high 
mortality rates in developing countries (age -standardized mortality rates of 7.9 and 2.2 per 
100,000 in males and females, respectively) [Gupta, B., et al 2016] .
More than 90% of pa rticipants with HNSCC initially present with disease confined to the 
head and neck mucosa and/or to the regional cervical lymph nodes [Machiels, J. P. 2011] . 
Surgery and radiation therapy are markedly effective for participants with Stage I and II 
disease. However, despite intensive multimodal treatment, approximately 50% to 60% of 
participants with locally advanced Stage III or Stage IV HNSCC recur initially with 
locoregional disease. However, a significant prop ortion of these participants ultimately have 
incurable disease recurrence requiring palliative systemic treatment. The prognosis for 
participants with R/M HNSCC is dismal and OS is less than 1 year [Argiris, A., et al 2017] .
Participants with R/M HNSCC present a therapeutic challenge. First -line treatment generally 
includes the combination of either cetuximab or docetaxel with a platinum -based 
chemotherapy with or without 5 -FU. Participants who are asymptomatic u sually are treated 
with monotherapy to balance the side -effects associated with combination regimens. Options 
for 1L single -agent treatment include platinum, 5 -FU, paclitaxel, docetaxel, methotrexate, 
cetuximab, gemcitabine, or capecitabine [National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2018] . 
No Phase 3 randomized trial showed an improvement in OS for any regimen until the 
EXTREME trial [Vermorken, J. B., et al 2008] . This tr ial showed that the addition of 
cetuximab to the combination of platinum plus 5 -FU improved median OS to 10.1 months 
from 7.4 months when compared with platinum plus 5 -FU alone.
Data from the final analysis of KEYNOTE -048, an ongoing Phase 3, open -label trial to 
compare the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab as monotherapy or in combination with 
chemotherapy (platinum plus 5 -FU) versus the standard EXTREME chemotherapy regimen 
(cetuximab in combination with platinum plus 5 -FU is provided in S ection 2.2.3). In the 
population of all participants, there was a clinically meaningful difference in OS when 
comparing pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy with standard treatment. The pembrolizumab 
monotherapy group had more responders who achieved a CR and a more durable DOR.
In preclinical models, lenvatinib decreased the TAM population, which is known as an 
immune -regulator in the tumor microenvironment. By decreasing TAMs, expression levels of 
cytokines and immune -regulating receptors were changed to incre ase immune activation. The 
08K59L

MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
immune -modulating effect of lenvatinib may result in a potent combination effect with PD -
1/PD -L1 signal inhibitors. The effect of combining lenvatinib with anti -PD-1/PD -L1 agents 
has been investigated in the CT26 colorectal cance r syngeneic model (anti -PD-L1 agent) as 
well as the LL/2 lung cancer syngeneic model (anti -PD-1 agent). Combination treatment with 
lenvatinib and either an anti PD -1 or anti -PD-L1 agent showed significant and superior 
antitumor effects compared with either compound alone in these 2 syngeneic models [Kato, 
Y., et al 2015] .
The ongoing pembrolizumab + lenvatinib combination Study 111/KEYNOTE -146 (Section 
2.2.3) in participants with HNSCC has shown promising clinica l activity and a manageable 
tolerability and safety profile [Taylor, M. H., et al 2018] . These results showed an ORR of 
40.9% and median PFS of 8.2 months that strongly suggest greater efficacy with the 
combinat ion of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab than with either single agent, a possibly 
additive effect.
The intended population of this Phase 3 trial represents participants with a high unmet 
medical need considering all of the participants have incurable disease. Based on results from 
the KEYNOTE -048 trial, which compared pembrolizumab monotherapy to current standard 
platinum -based chemotherapy plus cetuximab, pembrolizumab monotherapy may be 
considered a new standard -of-care treatment in 1L R/M HNSCC participants whose tumors 
express PD -L1 (CPS ≥1). Combination therapy with pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib would 
provide additional 1L treatment options for HNSCC participants.
2.2 Background
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized IgG4 mAb with high specificity of binding to t he PD 
1 receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD -L1 and PD -L2. Based on preclinical in 
vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1. 
Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as 
an IV immunotherapy for advanced malignancies. KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) is 
indicated for the treatment of participants across a number of indications.
Lenvatinib (also known as E7080 or MK 7902) inhibits the kinase activities of v ascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and 
VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic 
angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cell ular 
functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; platelet 
derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. Lenvatinib also exhibited 
antiproliferative activity in cell lines dependent on activated FGFR sign aling with a 
concurrent inhibition of FGF -receptor substrate 2α phosphorylation.

background information on pembrolizumab and lenvatinib.

2.2.1 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Back ground
2.2.1.1 Pembrolizumab
The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress 
immune control. The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T 
cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwant ed or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 that has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling on engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) 
[Greenwald, R. J., et al 2005] [Okazaki, T., et al 2001] .
The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved [Zhang, X., et al 2004] . PD-1 and its family 
members are Type -I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an IgV –type domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for the binding of sign aling 
molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based 
switch motif. After T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatase s, SHP -1 and 
SHP-2, to the immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, 
leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ, and ZAP70, 
which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade [Okazaki, T., et al 2001] [Chemnitz, 
J. M., et al 2004] [Sheppard, K -A, et al 2004] [Riley, J. L. 2009] . The mechanism by which 
PD-1 down -modulates T -cell responses is similar to, but distinct from, that of CTLA -4, 
because both molecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins [Parry, R. V., et al 
2005] [Francisco, L. M., et al 2010] . As a consequence, the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway is an 
attractive targe t for therapeutic intervention in R/M HNSCC.
2.2.1.2 Lenvatinib
Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from a pre -existing vascular network, is 
essential for tumor growth and metastasis. VEGF and its family of receptors (VEGRs 1 -3) 
play a major role in t umor angiogenesis [Ferrara, N., et al 2003] [Ellis, L. M. and Hicklin, D. 
J. 2008] [Tammela, T. and Alitalo, K. 2010] . Accumulated evidence suggests that FGF and 
its receptor tyrosine kinase, FGFR also play important roles for tumor angiogenesis [Cross, 
M. J. and Claesson -Welsh L. 2001] [Lieu, C., et al 2011] [Limaverde -Sousa, G., et al 2014] .
Lenvatinib is a potent multiple RTK inhibitor th at selectively inhibits VEGF receptors, 
VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4), FGFR1 -4, PDGFRα, KIT, and 
RET. Among known kinase inhibitors in clinical use, lenvatinib is one of the only inhibitors 
currently labeled with a mechanism of action as a n inhibitor of not only VEGFRs but also 
FGFRs, both of which are currently believed to be very important for tumor angiogenesis.
Lenvatinib inhibited cell free kinase activities for VEGFR1 -3 and FGFR1 -3 with Ki values 
around 1 nmol/L, and 8 -22 nmol/L, resp ectively. In cell -based assays, lenvatinib inhibited 
VEGF -derived and FGF -derived tube formation of HUVEC with IC50 values of 2.1 and 7.3 
nmol/L, respectively. Analysis of the signal transduction molecules revealed that lenvatinib 
inhibited both the MAPK p athway and the mTOR -S6K-S6 pathway in HUVECs triggered by

activated VEGFR and FGFR. Furthermore, lenvatinib (10, 30 mg/kg) significantly inhibited 
both VEGF -and FGF -driven angiogenesis in a murine in vivo model [Yamamoto, Y., et al 
2014] . In vivo, lenvatinib exhibited antitumor activity against various human tumor 
xenografts in athymic mice including 5 types of thyroid carcinomas (differentiated [papillary 
and follicular], anaplastic, squamous, and medullary thy roid carcinomas), RCC, HCC, 
melanoma, gastric cancer, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, Ewing’s sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. In 
addition, the antitumor activity of lenvatinib in combination with other anticancer agents in 
several xenograft models was greater than that of lenvatinib or the other agents alone.
In summary, lenvatinib inhibited VEGF -driven VEGFR2 phosphorylation and suppressed 
proliferation and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) models. 
Antitumor activity of lenvatinib in vivo h as been shown in numerous xenograft animals. 
These results suggest that lenvatinib may be a novel anticancer therapy through inhibition of 
angiogenesis and may be useful as either monotherapy or in combination with other 
anticancer drugs.
2.2.1.3 Pembrolizumab Plu s Lenvatinib
The importance of intact immune surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformations has been known for decades [Disis, M. L. 2010] . Accumulating evidence 
shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tissue and favorable 
prognosis in various malignancies. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio 
of CD8+ effector T -cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells (T -regs) correlates with improved 
prognos is and long -term survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, colorectal, and 
pancreatic cancer; hepatocellular carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and renal cell carcinoma. 
Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can be expanded ex vivo and reinfused, inducing dura ble 
objective tumor responses in cancers such as melanoma [Dudley, M. E., et al 2005] [Hunder, 
N. N., et al 2008] .
In preclinical models, lenvatinib decreased the tumor -associated macrophage (TAM) 
populat ion, which is known as an immune -regulator in the tumor microenvironment. The 
decrease in TAM population was accompanied by increases in activated cytotoxic T -cell 
populations through stimulation of interferon -gamma signaling, resulting in increased 
immune activation [Kimura, T., et al 2018] . The immune -modulating effect of lenvatinib 
may result in a potent combination effect with PD -1/L1 signal inhibitors. The effect of 
combining lenvatinib with an anti -human PD -1 humanized mAb was investigated in 4 
murine tumor isograft models, which showed significant tumor growth inhibition compared 
to control. In the RAG murine tumor isograft tumor model, survival in the group treated with 
the combination was significantly lo nger than that of the respective monotherapy groups. In 
the CT26 murine tumor isograft model, treatment with the combination significantly 
increased the population of activated cytotoxic T cells compared to that of the respective 
monotherapy groups [Kato, Y., et al 2019] . All treatments were well tolerated and severe 
body weight loss was not observed.

2.2.2.1 Completed Studies With Pembrolizumab and Lenvatinib
Refer to the respective IBs for preclinical and clinical study data for pembrolizumab [IB 
Edition 17 2019] and lenvatinib [IB Edition 16 2019] .
2.2.3 Ongoing Clinical Studies of Pembrolizumab and Lenvatinib
There is an expansive ongoing research program of clinical studies evaluating 
pembrolizumab in patients with a number of hematological and solid malignancies, including 
HNSCC. The clinical program for HNSCC consists of the completed and ongoing studies for 
recurrent/metastatic disease: KN012, KN055, KN040, and KN048, as well as this study, 
LEAP -010.
Lenvatinib is undergoing studies in participants with different types of solid tumors, 
including HNSCC, in combination with oth er therapies including PD -1 targeted therapies. 
Full lists of ongoing studies are in the respective IBs for pembrolizumab and lenvatinib.
Ongoing Clinical Studies of Pembrolizumab in HNSCC
KEYNOTE -012 (KN012) 
KN012 is a Phase 1B, multicohort study evaluat ing the single -agent activity of 
pembrolizumab in various solid tumors, including 2 cohorts of participants (Cohorts B and 
B2) with R/M HNSCC. Cohort B consisted of 60 participants with PD -L1 positive HNSCC 
who received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W. Cohort B 2 consisted of 132 participants 
regardless of PD -L1 status, who received pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W [Mehra, R., et al 
2016] . Responses were seen in both HPV -positive and HPV -negative participants. This was 
the fir st immunotherapy demonstrating clinically meaningful antitumor activity in a heavily 
pretreated incurable HNSCC population with recurrent/metastatic disease. Enrollment is 
closed, but participants are ongoing in the study.
The efficacy and safety results a fter long -term follow -up based on pooled data from Cohorts 
B and B2 were presented at ASCO 2016 [Mehra, R., et al 2016] . In the recurrent/metastatic 
HNSCC population (n=192), the ORR was 21.9% (95% CI; 12.5% to 34.0%) in HPV -
positive participants and 15.9% (95% CI: 10.0% to 23.4%) in HPV -negative participants. In 
a separate publication, when PD -L1 expression analyses were restricted to only tumor cells 
(tumor proportion scoring, TPS), there was no statistically s ignificant increase ORR with PD -
L1 positive ( ≥1%) versus negative (<1%) tumors. Conversely, when immune cells were 
included in the scoring system (CPS), PD -L1 expression on tumor and immune cells 
significantly correlated with ORR, PFS, and OS [Chow, L. Q., et al 2016] . Median OS was 
8.5 months (95% CI: 6.5 to 10.5). The 6 -month PFS rate was 24.9% [Mehra, R., et al 2016] .
Importantly, the responses seen with pembrolizum ab were durable. Among participants with 
recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, the DOR ranged from 1.8+ to 21.8+ months, and the median 
was not reached. Among participants who responded (n=34), 85% were in response for at 
least 6 months, and 71% of responders had on going responses [IB Edition 17 2019] . These 
08K59L
PRODUCT: MK-7902 60
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
results show the consistent durability of responses seen with pembrolizumab treatment and 
compare favorably to SOC chemotherapy or epidermal growth factor receptor inh ibitors. 
These results of KN012 show consistent and clinically meaningful activity of pembrolizumab 
in heavily pretreated participants with HNSCC and show a robust and unprecedented 
antitumor activity observed compared with available current SOC chemother apy agents. The 
prolonged DOR seen in the majority of participants that respond to pembrolizumab is 
substantially distinct from what is expected with chemotherapy in previously treated patients 
with HNSCC.
KEYNOTE -055 (KN055)
KN055 is a Phase 2, nonrandomi zed, single cohort study of pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W) 
monotherapy in a heavily pretreated population of patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC 
who have progressed on prior platinum and cetuximab therapy. Results from 171 participants 
treated with pembro lizumab were presented by Bauml et al [Bauml, J., et al 2017] . When 
confirmed responses were evaluated, the ORR was 16% (CR, n=1; PR, n=27; 95% CI: 11% 
to 23%) with a median DOR of 8 months (range, 2+ to 12+ mon ths); the stable disease rate 
was 19% (n=33; 95% CI: 14% to 26%). Response rates were slightly higher in participants 
that were PD -L1 positive; 18% of participants with CPS ≥1% PD -L1 expression responded 
to pembrolizumab compared with 12% of participants w ith CPS <1% expression. 
Nonetheless, PD -L1–negative participants responded to pembrolizumab at a rate that is 
clinically meaningful; 6 -and 12 -month PFS and OS rates were relatively similar between 
PD-L1–negative and PD -L1–positive participants. The result s presented by Bauml et al 
[Bauml, J., et al 2017] , confirm findings from KN012 in the recurrent/metastatic HNSCC 
population; pembrolizumab monotherapy (200 mg Q3W) demonstrates consistent and 
clinically meaning ful activity in heavily pretreated participants with HNSCC.
KEYNOTE -040 (KN040) 
KN040 is an ongoing Phase 3, randomized, active -controlled, open -label study of 
pembrolizumab versus the choice of 3 different SOC therapies in participants with R/M 
HNSCC. Fo ur hundred and ninety -five participants with R/M HNSCC were randomized 1:1 
to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W or the investigator’s choice of one of the following 
therapies chosen before randomization: single agent methotrexate, single agent docetaxel, or
single agent cetuximab. Randomization was stratified by ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1), 
HPV status (oropharynx –p16 positive vs. oropharynx –p16 negative or 
larynx/hypopharynx/oral cavity HNSCC), and PD -L1 status (strong positive or not; strong 
posit ive was defined as TPS ≥50% PD -L1 testing by IHC). The primary objective of the 
study was to evaluate OS in participants with R/M HNSCC treated with pembrolizumab 
compared with SOC treatment. Enrollment is closed, but participants are ongoing in the 
study.
The efficacy and safety data from the final analysis were reported, and at the time of the final 
analysis, 181 (73%) of 247 participants in the pembrolizumab group and 207 (83%) of 248 
participants in the SOC group had died. The median OS in the ITT popul ation was 8.4 
months (95% CI 6.4 to 9.4) with pembrolizumab and 6.9 months (5.9 to 8.0) with SOC (HR

= 0.8, 0.65 to 0.98; nominal p=0.0161). In the ITT population, the median DOR was 18.4 
months in the pembrolizumab group compared with only 5 months for SO C [Cohen, E. E. 
W., et al 2019] .
For participants with a PD -L1 CPS ≥1 tumor score, the HR for OS was 0.74 (95% CI 0.58 to 
0.93; nominal p=0.0049), with a median survival of 8.7 months (95% CI 6.9 to 11.4) for 
pembrolizumab versus 7.1 months (5.7 to 8.3) with SOC. In participants whose tumor had 
PD-L1 TPS ≥50% expression, the HR for death was 0.53 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.81; nominal 
p=0.0014), and median OS was 11.6 months (95% CI 8.3 to 19.5) compared with 6.6 months 
(4.8 to 9.2) for pembrolizumab and SOC, respectively. 
Fewer participants treated with pembrolizumab than with SOC had treatment -related AEs 
(63% vs. 84%), as well as higher toxicity AEs (Grade ≥3 treatment -related AEs 13% vs. 
36%).
KEYNOTE -048 (KN048)
KN048 is an ongoing Phase 3, randomized, active -controlled, open -label study of 
pembrolizumab, or pembrolizumab plus platinum plus 5 -FU chemotherapies versus platinum 
plus 5 -FU plus cetuximab (EXTREME regimen) in participants with 1L R/M HNSCC. A 
total of 882 p articipants with 1L R/M HNSCC were randomized worldwide 1:1:1 between 
the 3 arms of the study to examine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (n=301 
participants), or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (n=281 participants) versus SOC with 
cetuximab and ch emotherapy (n=300 participants) [Burtness, B., et al 2018] [CSR P048 
2020] . The primary endpoints of the study are PFS per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, 
and OS. Participants are ongoing in the study [CSR P048 2020] .
Data from the second interim analysis for KEYNOTE -048 were presented at the 2018 ESMO 
Congress [Burtness, B., et al 2018] . The cutoff date for this f inal PFS/interim OS analysis 
was13 -JUN-2018, with a minimum follow -up of approximately 17 months. For OS, 
pembrolizumab monotherapy was superior to the EXTREME regimen in participants with a 
CPS ≥20, HR = 0.61 (95% CI 0.45 -0.83, p=0.0007), and yielded a me dian OS that was 
longer with pembrolizumab (14.9 months) than the EXTREME regimen (10.7 months). 
Statistical significance was also achieved for pembrolizumab monotherapy in participants 
whose tumors had PD -L1 expression of CPS ≥1 with HR = 0.78 (95% CI 0.6 4 to 0.96, 
p=0.0086) and a median OS of 12.3 months versus 10.3 months in participants receiving the 
EXTREME regimen [Burtness, B., et al 2018] .
Confirmed ORR for pembrolizumab versus EXTREME was 23% versus 36% for CPS ≥20 
with a more durable DOR of 20.9 versus 4.2 months, and 19% versus 35% for CPS ≥1 with a 
median DOR of 20.9 versus 4.5 months for CPS ≥1 [Burtness, B., et al 2018] .
Pembrolizumab monotherapy had a mor e favorable toxicity profile compared with the 
EXTREME regimen with few treatment -related AEs (58.3% vs. 96.9%), fewer treatment -
related Grade 3 to 5 AEs (16.7% vs. 69.0%), and fewer treatment -related AEs that led to 
treatment discontinuation (4.7% vs. 19. 9%) [CSR P048V01MK3475 2018] .

Data cutoff of the final analysis was 25 -FEB-2019 (approximately 25 months after the last 
participant was randomized) [CSR P048 2020] . In participants whose tumors had PD -L1 
expression, OS results further confirmed the statistically and clinically meaningful results 
observed at the second interim analysis, with an OS HR = 0.74 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.90) for CPS 
≥1 and HR = 0.58 (95% CI: 0.44, 0. 78) for CPS ≥20 [CSR P048 2020] . In the population of 
all participants, there was a clinically meaningful difference in OS when comparing 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy with standard treatment. The pembrolizuma b 
monotherapy group had more responders who achieved a complete response and a more 
durable DOR (22.6 vs. 4.5 months) [Rischin, D., et al 2019] . The safety results at the final 
analysis were similar to those obs erved at the second interim analysis.
At the second interim analysis, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy significantly improved OS in 
the total population (HR = 0.77 [95% CI 0.63 -0.93]; p=0.00335) [CSR P048V01MK3475 
2018 ]. Additionally, the safety profiles for pembrolizumab + chemotherapy and the 
EXTREME regimen were comparable (95.3% vs. 96.9% treatment -related AEs; 71.0% vs 
69.0% treatment -related Grade 3 to 5 AEs; and 22.8% vs 19.9% treatment -related AEs that 
led to treatment discontinuation) [CSR P048V01MK3475 2018] . 
At the final analysis, pembrolizumab + chemotherapy OS results (HR = 0.72 [95% CI: 0.60, 
0.87]) [CSR P048 2020] further confirmed the statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful OS observed at the second interim analysis. In the population of participants who 
tumors express PD -L1, OS was statistically significant and clinically meaningful in PD -L1 
CPS ≥1 (H R = 0.65 [95% CI: 0.53, 0.80], p=0.00002) and in CPS ≥20 (HR = 0.60 [95% CI: 
0.45, 0.82], p=0.00044) [CSR P048 2020] . Furthermore, in participants whose tumors had 
PD-L1 expression, ORR and median time to respon se were similar, but the pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy group had more durable DOR of 6.7 versus 4.3 months for CPS ≥1 and 7.1 
versus 4.2 months for CPS ≥20 [Rischin, D., et al 2019] . The safety results at the fin al 
analysis were similar to those observed at the second interim analysis.
In summary, for 1L R/M HNSCC, pembrolizumab monotherapy significantly improved OS 
over the EXTREME regimen in both the CPS ≥20 and CPS ≥1 populations. Responses to 
pembrolizumab wer e durable with a more favorable toxicity profile compared with the 
EXTREME regimen. Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy improved OS in the total 
population and in participants whose tumors had PD -1 expression, with a comparable safety 
profile. Therefore, pembr olizumab -based treatment may be considered a new 1L standard of 
care for R/M HNSCC.
Study 111/KEYNOTE -146
Study 111/KEYNOTE -146 is a multicenter, open -label, Phase 1b/2 clinical study being 
conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in com bination with 
pembrolizumab in selected solid tumors (ie, HNSCC, NSCLC, RCC, endometrial cancer, 
urothelial carcinoma, and melanoma) [IB Edition 16 2019] . The Phase 1b portion of this 
study has been completed an d Phase 2 is ongoing. During the Phase 1b portion of the study, 
the MTD was determined to be 20 mg lenvatinib daily in combination with 200 mg of 
pembrolizumab IV Q3W. The safety and efficacy of the combination at the lenvatinib RP2D 
is being assessed in t he Phase 2 portion of the study.

As of 01 -DEC -2017, 22 study participants with measurable, confirmed metastatic HNSCC 
and ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 were enrolled in this cohort and received lenvatinib 
(20 mg/day orally) + pembrolizumab (200 mg IV Q 3W). Participants were not preselected 
based on PD -L1 status. Tumor assessments were performed by study investigators using 
irRECIST. Of the participants, 9.1% had received no prior anticancer therapy, 63.6% had 
received 1 prior line of anticancer therapy, and 13.6% had received 2 prior lines of anticancer 
therapies and 13.6% had received ≥3 prior lines of anticancer therapies, respectively. At data 
cutoff ( 01-DEC -2017), ORR was 40.9% (95% CI: 20.7, 63.6); ORR (at Week 24) was 36.4% 
(95% CI: 17.2, 59.3), in cluding 1 (4.5%) CR, 8 (36.4%) PR, 11 (50%) SD, 0 (0%) PD, and 2 
(9.1%) unknown; median PFS of 8.2 months (95% CI: 4.3, NE); and PFS rate at 12 months 
was 41.9 % (95% CI: 17.6, 64.7) [Taylor, M. H., et al 2018] .
Grade 3 or 4 treatment -related AEs occurred in 72.7% of participants (Grade 3 treatment -
related AEs in 15 participants [68.2%] and Grade 4 treatment -related AEs in 1 participant 
[4.5%]). The most common treatment -related AEs were fatigue (50.0%; Grade 3: 4 .5%), 
hypertension (40.9%, Grade 3: 18.2%), and diarrhea (36.4%, Grade 3: 4.5%). Five 
participants experienced serious treatment -related AEs including hypertension, acute kidney 
injury, dehydration, hemoptysis and pulmonary edema. There were 5 fatal AEs re ported; 
none were deemed treatment -related [Taylor, M. H., et al 2018] .
Overall, the study showed promising clinical activity and manageable toxicities, supporting 
further evaluation of the lenvatinib + pembroli zumab in participants with HNSCC [Taylor, 
M. H., et al 2018a] . Interim analysis results for NSCLC, urothelial carcinoma, melanoma, 
endometrial carcinoma and RCC study arms produced similar response rates and acc eptable 
safety and tolerability [Brose, M., et al 2018] [Vogelzang, N., et al 2018] [Taylor, M., et al 
2018] [Makker, V., et al 2018] [Lee, C. H., et al 2018] . From these studies, the combination 
of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib showed promising clinical activity and a manageable safety 
profile that is consistent with the safety profile of each agent when administered as 
monotherapy.
Based on Study 111/KEYNOTE -146, lenvatini b 20 mg QD in combination with 
pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W was the dose selected for this Phase 3 study.
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
It cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studies will directly benefit from 
treatment during participation, as cli nical studies are designed to provide information about 
the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medicine.
With the results of the KEYNOTE -048 clinical trial demonstrating survival benefit with 
pembrolizumab for 1L R/M HNSCC, there is rationale f or treating the participants with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy in the CPS ≥1 biomarker population. Therefore, 
pembrolizumab will be used in both the control and experimental arms, and all participants 
can be considered to be receiving clinically beneficial th erapy. The existing data suggest that 
inhibiting angiogenesis in combination with PD -1 blockade is a promising therapeutic 
strategy, and the benefit/risk assessment for participants in this study is considered to be 
favorable, making the combination of pem brolizumab + lenvatinib a promising therapeutic

option to test in participants with 1L R/M HNSCC whose tumor demonstrates PD -L1 
expression.
Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for participants participating in this 
clinical study may b e found in the accompanying IB and informed consent documents.
NOTE: Based on the data from an interim safety and efficacy analysis for LEAP -010(data 
cutoff 30 -May-2023 ),the study will be discontinued based on a lack of additional clinical 
benefit on OS of the combination of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib over pembrolizumab 
monotherapy. At this interim analysis, the combination did not demonstrate an improvement 
in OS versus pembrolizumab alone, and the likelihood of reaching the protocol specified 
thresho ld for statistical significance for OS at a future analysis was evaluated and deemed to 
be low. Based upon these data, the study was unblinded on16-Aug-2023 . The prespecified 
third interim analysis and final analysis of the study described in the SAP will not be 
performed. Safety analysis will be performed at the end of the study; there will be no further 
planned analyses for efficacy and ePRO endpoints.

3 HYPOTHESES, OBJECTIVES, AND ENDPOINTS
Hypotheses are aligned with objectives in the Objectives and Endpoints table.
Inmales and females who are at least 18 years old ,with a histologically confirmed diagnosis 
of R/M HNSCC that is biomarker positive ( combined positive score ( CPS ≥1)), and who are 
considered incurable by local therapies wi ll be enrolled in this study.
Throughout this protocol, the term RECIST 1.1 refers to the adjustment of RECIST 1.1 to 
include a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Refer 
to Section 4.2.1.1.1 for further details.
NOTE: Based on the data from an interim safety and efficacy analysis for LEAP -010(data 
cutoff 30 -May-2023 ),the study will be discontinued based on a lack of additional clinical 
benefit on OS of the combination of pembrolizumab plus; lenvatinib over pembrolizum ab 
monotherapy. At this interim analysis, the combination did not demonstrate an improvement 
in OS versus pembrolizumab alone, and the likelihood of reaching the protocol specified 
threshold for statistical significance for OS at a future analysis was eval uated and deemed to 
be low. Based upon these data, the study was unblinded on16-Aug-2023 . The prespecified 
third interim analysis and final analysis of the study described in the SAP will not be 
performed. Safety analysis will be performed at the end of t he study; there will be no further 
planned analyses for efficacy and ePRO endpoints.
NOTE: In alignment with the study -specific investigator letter dated 25 -Aug-2023 , all study 
participants still receiving pembrolizumab should continue to receive pembrolizumab 
monotherapy on study and undergo modified protocol study procedures as specified in this 
amendment. Study participation should end after the 30 -day Safety Follow -up Visit (last 
scheduled visit) with the following exceptions: participants who are potential candidates for 
Second Course treatment will continue in Efficacy Follow -up and all participants in China 
will continue in Efficacy Follow -up and Survival Follow -up. All participants should stop 
ongoing treatment with lenvatinib/placebo.
Excep tions may be requested for lenvatinib for study participants who, in the assessment of 
their study physician, are benefiting from ongoing lenvatinib after consulting with the 
Sponsor. This applies to participants currently on pembrolizumab and lenvatinib a nd 
participants who have discontinued pembrolizumab and are currently continuing lenvatinib 
monotherapy. Participants who are considered by the investigator as candidates for continued 
monotherapy with lenvatinib after completion of 35 cycles of pembrolizu mab and lenvatinib 
require a separate communication with the Sponsor. Participants who discontinue 
pembrolizumab prior to completion of Cycle 35 (eg, due to an AE) must discontinue 
lenvatinib at the same time.
All participants beyond the 30 -day Safety Foll ow-up Visit (except participants who are 
potential candidates for Second Course treatment and all participants in China) should be 
discontinued from the study; however standard safety reporting should continue, as 
applicable. As of Amendment 05, participan ts who are still on study treatment will no longer 
require ePRO assessments or tumor response assessments by BICR to be performed. Scans

will no longer be submitted to the iCRO. (Note: tumor response assessments by BICR and 
submission of scans to the iCRO will continue for participants in China.) Participants who 
are still on study medication should continue tumor imaging and investigator assessment s of 
imaging per protocol. Biomarker specimen collection is discontinued. The 30 -Day Safety 
Follow -up Visit is the last required visit (except participants who are potential candidates for 
Second Course treatment and all participants in China) . Updated analyses are described in

4 STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overall Design
Original protocol text that is contained in this section has been retained for reference.
NOTE: Based on the data from an interim safety and efficacy analysis for LEAP -010 (data 
cutoff 30 -May-2023 ), the study will be discontinued based on a lack of additional clinical 
benefit on OS of the combination of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib over pembrolizumab 
monotherapy. At this interim analysis, the combination did not demonstrate an improvement 
in OS versus pembrolizumab alone, and the likelihood of reaching the protocol specified 
threshold for statistical significance for OS at a future analysis was evaluated and deemed to 
be low. Based upon these data, the study was unblinded on16-Aug-2023. The pr especified 
third interim analysis and final analysis of the study described in the SAP will not be 
performed. Safety analysis will be performed at the end of the study; there will be no further 
planned analyses for efficacy and ePRO endpoints.
NOTE: In ali gnment with the study -specific investigator letter dated 25 -Aug-2023 , all study 
participants still receiving pembrolizumab should continue to receive pembrolizumab 
monotherapy on study and undergo modified protocol study procedures as specified in this 
amendment. Study participation should end after the 30 -day Safety Follow -up Visit (last 
scheduled visit) with the following exceptions: participants who are potential candidates for 
Second Course treatment will continue in Efficacy Follow -up and all participants in China 
will continue in Efficacy follow -up and Survival Follow -up. All participants should stop 
ongoing treatment with lenvatin ib/placebo. 
Exceptions may be requested for lenvatinib for study participants who, in the assessment of 
their study physician, are benefiting from ongoing lenvatinib after consulting with the 
Sponsor . This applies to participants currently on pembrolizuma b and lenvatinib and 
participants who have discontinued pembrolizumab and are currently continuing lenvatinib 
monotherapy . Participants who are considered by the investigator as candidates for continued 
monotherapy with lenvatinib after completion of 35 cy cles of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib 
require a separate communication with the Sponsor . Participants who discontinue 
pembrolizumab prior to completion of Cycle 35 (eg, due to an AE) must discontinue 
lenvatinib at the same time.
All participants beyond the 30-day Safety Follow -up Visit (except participants who are 
potential candidates for Second Course treatment and all participants in China) should be 
discontinued from the study; however standard safety reporting should continue, as 
applicable . As of Amendm ent 05, participants who are still on study treatment will no longer 
require ePRO assessments or tumor response assessments by BICR to be performed . Scans 
will no longer be submitted to the iCRO . (Note: tumor response assessments by BICR and 
submission of scans to the iCRO will continue for participants in China.) Participants who 
are still on study medication should continue tumor imaging and investigator assessment s of 
imaging per protocol . Biomarker specimen collection is discontinued . The 30 -Day Safety 
Follow -up Visit is the last required visit (except participants who are potential candidates for

Second Course treatment and all participants in China) . Updated analyses are described in 
Section 9.
This is a randomized, placebo -controlled, double -bind, pa rallel design, multisite study of 
pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib versus pembrolizumab plus placebo as 1L intervention in 
participants with R/M HNSCC whose tumors express PD -L1 (CPS ≥1). This Phase 3 study 
will be conducted in participants who have measurabl e disease per RECIST 1.1 as assessed 
by BICR, an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and have tumors that express PD -L1 CPS 
>1 by immunohistochemistry testing.
The original study design is shown in Figure 1(Initial Treatment) and Figure 2(Second 
Course). The new study design per Amendment 05 is depicted in Figure 3and Figure 4.
Approximately 500 participants will be randomized 1:1 to Arm 1 (pembrolizumab + 
lenvatinib) or Arm 2 (pembrolizumab + placebo). Stratification factors for this study are:
•PD-L1tumor expression as determined by PD -L1 immunohistochemistry (TPS <50% vs. 
≥50%)
•HPV status for oropharynx cancer as determined by p16 immunohistochemistry (positive 
or negative); HPV status for participants without oropharynx cancer (eg, cancers of the 
oral cavity, hypopharynx and larynx) is considered HPV negative.
•ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1)
Specific procedures to be performed during the study, including prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in Section 1.3of the SoA. Detail s of each procedure 
are provided in Section 8.
Participants will be evaluated with radiographic imaging to assess response to study 
intervention every 6 weeks from randomization through Year 1, and every 9 weeks after 
Year 1. All imaging obtained during th e study will be submitted to the iCRO for 
determination of ORR and PFS (Section 4.2.1.1.1). Tumor imaging showing site -assessed PD 
will be submitted for verification by BICR. Treatment beyond centrally -verified PD per 
RECIST 1.1 may be permitted at the dis cretion of the investigator after consultation with the 
Sponsor and receiving signed informed consent. 
Survival follow -up will begin after centrally -verified PD (or on completion of all efficacy 
assessments if the participant is receiving study interventi on beyond centrally -verified PD) or 
the start of new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first. On Sponsor request, 
participants may be contacted for survival status at any time during the study.
AE monitoring will be ongoing throughout the study. AEs w ill be graded in severity 
according to the guidelines outlined in the NCI CTCAE v5.0.
Treatment with pembrolizumab will continue for up to 35 treatment cycles, or until a 
discontinuation criterion (Section 7.1) is met. Participants who stop pembrolizumab a fter

MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
35cycles may continue to receive lenvatinib/placebo until a discontinuation criterion 
(Section 7.1) is met.
Participants who meet the criteria outlined in Section 6.7 may be considered for Second 
Course treatment with up to 17 cycles of pembrolizumab with or without lenvatinib/placebo.
After enrollment of the global portion of the study is complete, the study may remain open to 
enrollment in China alone until the target number of participants in China has been enrolled 
to meet local regulatory requirements. An extension portion of the study will be identical to 
the global study, (eg, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study endpoints, primary and 
secondary objectives, and study procedures).
Note: At the time of writing Amendment 05, en rollment in the China extension has closed.
Refer to Appendix 7 for country -specific requirements.
Three interim analyses are planned in this study (Section 9.7).
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
4.2.1 Rationale for Endpoints
4.2.1.1 Efficacy Endpoints
This study will use OS, ORR and PFS as primary endpoints. OS has been recognized as the 
gold standard for demonstration of superiority of a new antineoplastic therapy in randomized 
clinical trial. ORR and PFS are based on RECIST 1.1 criteria as assessed by BICR as the 
primary endpoints. ORR and PFS are acceptable measures of clinical benefit for a late -stage 
study that demonstrates superiority of a new antineoplastic therapy, especially if the 
magnitude of the effect is large and the therapy has an acceptable ri sk/benefit profile. The use 
of BICR and RECIST 1.1 to assess ORR and PFS is typically considered acceptable by 
regulatory authorities. Images will be submitted to an iCRO and read by an independent 
central review blinded to treatment assignment to minimize bias in the response assessments. 
In addition, the final determination of radiologic progression will be based on the central 
assessment of progression, rather than a local site investigator/radiology assessment. 
Expedited verification of radiologic progr ession as determined by central review will be 
communicated to the site.
4.2.1.1.1 RECIST 1.1
RECIST 1.1 will be used by the BICR when assessing images for efficacy measures. 
Although original RECIST 1.1 publication recommends a maximum of 5 target lesions in 
total and 2 per organ, this protocol has implemented an adjustment to RECIST 1.1 to allow a 
maximum of 10 target lesions in total and 5 per organ, if a larger number of target lesions is 
needed to adequately represent the tumor burden. Refer to Section 8.2.1.5 for additional 
detail.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
4.2.1.2 Safety Endpoints
Safety parameters frequently used for evaluating investigational -systemic anticancer 
treatments are included as safety endpoints including, but not limited to, the incidence of, 
causality, and outcome of AEs/SAEs ,andchanges in vital signs and laboratory values. AEs 
will be assessed as defined by CTCAE, Version 5.0.
4.2.1.3 Exploratory Endpoints
4.2.1.3.1 Rationale for Patient -reported Outcomes Endpoints
Changes in HRQoL using PRO assessments can provide important information on clinic al 
benefit and are accepted clinical endpoints by health authorities. Participants will provide 
information regarding their HRQoL using the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ -H&N35 
PRO instruments. Health utilities will be evaluated using the EQ 5D -5L PRO instrum ent. 
These PROs assessments are not pure efficacy or safety endpoints because they are affected 
by both disease progression and treatment tolerability.
The EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ -H&N35 are psychometrically and clinically 
validated instruments appropriate for assessing HRQoL in participants with HNSCC 
[Bjordal, K., et al 1994] [Bjordal, K., et al 2000] . These instruments have been widely used 
in Phase 3 studies of participants with R/M HNSCC [Mesia, R., et al 2010] [Machiels, J. P., 
et al 2015] [Harrington, K. J., et al 2017] [Cohen, E. E. W., et al 2018] .
EORTC QLQ -C30
EORTC QLQ -C30 is the most widely used cancer -specific HRQoL instrument, which 
contains 30 items and measures 5 functional dimensions (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, 
and social), 3 symptom items (fatigue, nausea/vom iting, and pain), 6 single items (dyspnea, 
sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact), and a global 
health and QoL scale [Aaronson, N. K., et al 1993] . The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a
psychometrically and clinically validated instrument appropriate for assessing QoL in 
oncology studies [Aaronson, N. K., et al 1993] .
EORTC QLQ -H&N35
TheEORTC QLQ -H&N35 is a disease -specific questionnaire dev eloped to measure QoL in 
head and neck cancer .The EORTC QLQ -H&N35 consists of 7 multi -item scales (pain in the 
mouth, problems with swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact, and 
sexuality), and 11 single -item scales (problems with teeth, mouth opening, dry mouth, sticky 
saliva, coughing, feeling ill, use of analgesics, use of nutritional supplements, use of feeding 
tube, weight gain, and weight loss) [Bjordal, K., et al 1994] .
EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L
The EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome 
and will provide data to develop health utilities for use in health economic analyses [Rabin, 
R. and de Charro, F. 2001] . The 5 health state dimensions in the EQ -5D-5L include the 
08K59L

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
following: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each 
dimension is rated on a 5 -point scale from 1 (no problem) to 5 (unable to/extreme problems). 
The EQ -5D-5L also includes a graded (0 to 100) vertical visual analog scale on which the 
participant rates his or her general state of health at the time of the assessment. This 
instrument has been used extensively in cancer studies and published results from these 
studies support its validity and reliability [Pickard, A. S., et al 2007] [Pickard, A. S., et al 
2007a] .
4.2.1.4 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
No PK endpoints are planned for this study.
4.2.1.5 Pharmacodynamic Endpoints
No pharmacodynamic endpoints are planned for this study.
4.2.1.6 Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research
Cancer immunotherapies represent an important and novel class of antitumor agents. 
However, the mechanism of action of these exciting new therapies, including novel 
combination with antiangiogenesis therapy, is not completely understood and much remains 
to be learned regarding how best to leverage these new drugs in treating patients. Thus, to aid 
future patients, it is im portant to investigate the determinants of response or resistance to 
cancer immunotherapy and other treatments administered, as well as determinants of AEs in 
the course of our clinical studies. These efforts may identify novel predictive/PD biomarkers 
andgenerate information that may better guide single -agent and combination therapy with 
immuno -oncology drugs. To identify novel biomarkers, biospecimens (ie, blood components, 
tumor material) will be collected to support analyses of cellular components (eg, protein, 
DNA, RNA, metabolites) and other circulating molecules. Investigations may include but are 
not limited to:
Germline (blood) genetic analyses (eg, SNP analyses, whole exome sequencing, whole 
genome sequencing)
This research may evaluate whether ge netic variation within a clinical study population 
correlates with response to the treatment(s) under evaluation. If genetic variation is found to 
predict efficacy or AEs, the data might inform optimal use of therapies in the patient 
population. Furthermor e, it is important to evaluate germline DNA variation across the 
genome in order to interpret tumor -specific DNA mutations.
Genetic (DNA) analyses from tumor
The application of new technologies, such as next generation sequencing, has provided 
scientists t he opportunity to identify tumor -specific DNA changes (ie, mutations, methylation 
status, microsatellite instability) contributing towards the development/progression of cancer 
and/or driving response to therapy. Key molecular changes of interest to immuno -oncology 
drug development include the mutational burden of tumors and the clonality of T -cells in the 
tumor microenvironment. Increased mutational burden (sometimes referred to as a ‘hyper -

mutated’ state) may generate neo -antigen presentation in the tumor microenvironment. To 
conduct this type of research, it is important to identify tumor -specific mutations that occur 
across all genes in the tumor genome. Evaluation of molecular targets and signaling 
pathways including angiogenesis and/or growth factor re lated signaling pathways related to 
pembrolizumab and lenvatinib may also be explored. Thus, genome -wide approaches may be 
used for this effort. Note that in order to understand tumor -specific mutations, it is necessary 
to compare the tumor genome with the germline genome. Circulating tumor DNA and/or 
RNA may also be evaluated from blood samples.
Tumor and blood RNA analyses
Both genome -wide and targeted messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiling and 
sequencing in tumor tissue and in blood may be performed t o define gene signatures that 
correlate to clinical response to treatment with pembrolizumab or other immunotherapies. 
Pembrolizumab induces a response in tumors that likely reflects an inflamed/immune 
phenotype. Specific immune -related gene sets (ie, thos e capturing interferon -gamma 
transcriptional pathways) may be evaluated and new signatures may be identified. Individual 
genes related to the immune system and growth factor signaling pathways (eg, VEGF and 
FGF) may also be evaluated. MicroRNA profiling ma y also be pursued as well as exosomal 
profiling.
Proteomics and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using blood or tumor
Tumor and blood samples from this study may undergo proteomic analyses (eg, PD -L1 IHC). 
PD-L1 protein level in tumor sections, assessed by IHC, has been shown to correlate with 
response to pembrolizumab in patients with NSCLC, and an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device 
has been developed for use with pembrolizumab in NSCLC. Preliminary data indicates that 
this association may also be true in addition al cancer types (ie, triple negative breast cancer, 
head and neck, and gastric). Additional tumor or blood -derived proteins may also correlate 
with response to pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination therapy. Therefore, tumor tissue 
may be subjected to pr oteomic analyses using a variety of platforms that could include but 
are not limited to immunoassays and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. This 
approach could identify novel protein biomarkers that could aid in patient selection for 
pembrolizumab (M K-3475) and lenvatinib combination therapy.
Other blood -derived biomarkers
In addition to expression on the tumor tissue, PD -L1, circulating cytokines and angiogenic 
factors, and other tumor derived proteins can be shed from tumor and released into the blo od. 
Assays such as enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) measure such proteins in 
serum. Correlation of expression with response to pembrolizumab and lenvatinib 
combination therapy may identify new approaches for predictive biomarkers in blood, 
represe nting a major advance from today’s reliance on assessing tumor biomarkers. This 
research would serve to develop such assays for future clinical use.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
Other molecular changes of interest include the subtype of T -cells in the tumor 
microenvironment. The T -cell repertoire from tumor tissue and blood components may be 
evaluated.
Biomarker research using stool
Landmark studies have demonstrated that the gut microbiome can shape anti -tumor 
immunity and responses to immune checkpoint blockade in mouse models, and t hat 
modulation of the gut microbiome may enhance responses to immune checkpoint blockade. 
This has also been studied in patients on immune checkpoint blockade (anti -CTLA -4 and 
anti-PD-1), with evidence that differential bacterial signatures exist in respon ders versus non -
responders to therapy (with responders having higher diversity of the gut microbiome and 
differential composition compared with non -responders). Importantly, these differences in 
the gut microbiome are associated with differential immune si gnatures in the tumor 
microenvironment [Lynch, S. V. 2016] .
4.2.2 Rationale for the Use of Comparator/Placebo
Based on results from the KEYNOTE -048 trial, which compared pembrolizumab 
monotherapy to current standard p latinum -based chemotherapy plus cetuximab, 
pembrolizumab monotherapy showed clinical benefit and may be considered a standard -of-
care treatment in first -line R/M HNSCC participants whose tumors express PD -L1 (CPS ≥1) 
and is therefore being used as the comp arator in this trial.
The use of a placebo in combination with pembrolizumab will ensure the objectivity of the 
local investigators’ treatment decisions and AE causality assessments.
4.3 Justification for Dose
4.3.1 Pembrolizumab
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg Q3W. Based on the totality of 
data generated in the Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is an appropriate dose of 
pembrolizumab for adults across all indications. As outlined below, this dose is justified by:
•Clinical data from 8 randomized studies in melanoma and NSCLC indications 
demonstrating flat dose -and exposure -efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 
10mg/kg Q2W representing an approximate 5 -to 7.5 -fold exposure range (refer to IB, 
Section 5.2.2)
•Popu lation PK analysis showing that both fixed dosing and weight -based dosing provides 
similar control of PK variability with considerable overlap in the distributions of 
exposures, supporting suitability of 200 mg Q3W
•Clinical data showing meaningful improvem ent in benefit -risk including overall survival 
at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications
•Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred 
from PK data) and tumor (inferred from PBPK analysis) at 200 mg Q3W.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled 
with melanoma and NSCLC, covering different disease settings (treatment -naïve, previously 
treated, PD -L1 enriched, and all -comers) and different treatment settings (monoth erapy and 
in combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg 
Q3W (KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies 
compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and 
KN0 06). All of these studies showed flat dose -and exposure -response relationships across 
the doses studied representing an approximate 5 -to 7.5 -fold difference in exposure. The 
2mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed -dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest dos es 
studied. Subsequently, flat dose -exposure -response relationships were also observed in other 
tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical 
Hodgkin lymphoma, confirming 200 mg Q3W as the appropriate dose indepen dent of the 
tumor type. These findings are consistent with the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, 
which acts by interaction with immune cells, and not via direct binding to cancer cells.
Additionally, pharmacology data clearly show target saturation at 200 mg Q3W. First, PK 
data in KN001 evaluating TMDD conclusively showed saturation of PD -1 in systemic 
circulation at doses much lower than 200 mg Q3W. Second, a PBPK analysis was conducted 
to predict tumor PD -1 saturation over a wide range of tumor penetr ation and PD -1 
expression. This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W achieves full 
PD-1 saturation in both blood and tumor.
Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of 
body weight and other partic ipant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed -dosing 
provides similar control of PK variability as weight -based dosing, with considerable overlap 
in the distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. 
Supported by th ese PK characteristics and given that fixed -dose has advantages of reduced 
dosing complexity and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose was 
selected for evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols.
4.3.2 Lenvatinib
The dosing regimen of lenvatinib was selected based on the results of the Phase 1b portion of 
Phase 1b/2 Study 111/KEYNOTE -146, the primary endpoint of which was to determine the 
MTD and RP2D for lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W. Thirteen 
participants (le nvatinib 24 mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W: n=3; lenvatinib 20 
mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg: n=10) were enrolled in the Phase 1b portion of the study. 
Eight of the participants had RCC, 2 had NSCLC, 2 had endometrial carcinoma, and 1 had 
melanoma. T here were 2 DLTs at the dose of lenvatinib 24 mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg 
IV Q3W (1 participant had Grade 3 arthralgia, and another had Grade 3 fatigue); hence, this 
was defined as the toxic dose. No DLTs were reported in the next 10 participants (expans ion 
part), all of whom received the lenvatinib 20 mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W dose.
Based on review of all of the clinical data from these 13 participants, the MTD and RP2D 
were determined to be 20 mg lenvatinib daily in combination with a fixed dose of 200 mg 
pembrolizumab given Q3W. Based on the promising anti -tumor efficacy and tolerable safety 
profile seen in both the endometrial carcinoma and RCC expansion cohorts from Study

111/KEYNOTE -146 [Makker, V., e t al 2018] , two Phase 3 studies have been initiated for 
both of these tumor types, Study E7080 -G000 -309/KEYNOTE -775 and Study E7080 -G000 -
307/KEYNOTE -581.
4.3.3 Starting Dose for This Study
The starting dose of lenvatinib/placebo is 20 mg/day. Dose reductions of lenvatinib occur in 
succession based on the previous dose level (14, 10, and 8 mg/day). See Section 6.6 for dose 
modification. All participants will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W. Pembrolizumab 
dose reductions are not permitted.
4.3.4 Maximum Dose Expos ure for This Study
NOTE: In alignment with the study -specific investigator letter dated 25 -Aug-2023 , all study 
participants still receiving pembrolizumab should continue to receive pembrolizumab 
monotherapy on study and undergo modified protocol study proc edures as specified in this 
amendment. Study participation should end after the 30 -day Safety Follow -up Visit (last 
scheduled visit) with the following exceptions: participants who are potential candidates for 
Second Course treatment will continue in Effic acy Follow -up and all participants in China 
will continue in Efficacy Follow -upand Survival Follow -up. All participants should stop 
ongoing treatment with lenvatinib/placebo. 
Exceptions may be requested for lenvatinib for study participants who, in the assessment of 
their study physician, are benefiting from ongoing lenvatinib after consulting with the 
Sponsor . This applies to participants currently on pembrolizumab and lenvatinib and 
participants who have discontinued pembrolizumab and are currently continuing lenvatinib 
monotherapy. Participants who are considered by the investigator as candidates for continued 
monotherapy with lenvatinib after completion of 35 cycles of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib 
require a separate communication with the Sponsor .Participants who discontinue 
pembrolizumab prior to completion of Cycle 35 (eg, due to an AE) must discontinue 
lenvatinib at the same time.
The maximum dose/exposure of pembrolizumab allowed in this study is 200 mg Q3W for 
approximately 2 years (35 cycles ). Participants meeting criteria for Second Course treatment 
with pembrolizumab (Section 6.7) may receive an additional 200 mg IV Q3W for up to 1 
year (17 cycles).
The maximum dose/exposure of lenvatinib allowed in this study is 20 mg QD until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity.
4.4 Beginning and End -of-Study Definition
The overall study begins when the first participant (or their legally acceptable representative) 
provides documented informed consent. The overall study ends when the last participant 
completes the last study -related contact, withdraws consent, or is lost to follow -up (Section 
7.3).For purposes of analysis and reporting, the overall study ends when the Sponsor 
receives the last laboratory test result or at the time of final contact wit h the last participant, 
whichever comes last.

Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), 
placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study participant accor ding to 
the study protocol.
Clinical supplies (pembrolizumab and lenvatinib/matching placebo) will be packaged to 
support enrollment .Clinical supplies will be affixed with a clinical label in accordance with 
regulatory requirements.
6.1 Study Intervention(s) Administered
NOTE: In alignment with the study -specific investigator letter dated 25 -Aug-2023 , all study 
participants still receiving pembrolizumab should continue to receive pembrolizumab 
monotherapy on study and undergo modified protocol study procedures as specified in this 
amendment. Study participation should end after the 30 -day Safety Follow -up Visit (last 
scheduled visit) with the following exceptions: participants who are potential candidates for 
Second Course treatment will continu e in Efficacy Follow -up and all participants in China 
will continue in Efficacy Follow -upand Survival Follow -up. All participants should stop 
ongoing treatment with lenvatinib/placebo. 
Exceptions may be requested for lenvatinib for study participants who , in the assessment of 
their study physician, are benefiting from ongoing lenvatinib after consulting with the 
Sponsor . This applies to participants currently on pembrolizumab and lenvatinib and 
participants who have discontinued pembrolizumab and are curr ently continuing lenvatinib 
monotherapy . Participants who are considered by the investigator as candidates for continued 
monotherapy with lenvatinib after completion of 35 cycles of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib 
require a separate communication with the Spo nsor. Participants who discontinue 
pembrolizumab prior to completion of Cycle 35 (eg, due to an AE) must discontinue 
lenvatinib at the same time.

interventions in accordance with the protocol and any applicable laws and regulations.
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1 Intervention Assignment
Intervention randomization will occur centrally using an IRT system. There are 2study 
intervention arms. Pa rticipants will be assigned randomly in a 1:1ratio to pembrolizumab + 
lenvatinib (Arm 1) or pembrolizumab + placebo (Arm 2) study interventions .
6.3.2 Stratification
Intervention randomization will be stratified according to the following factors:
1.PD-L1 tumor expression as determined by PD -L1 immunohistochemistry (TPS <50% vs. 
≥50%).
2.HPV status for oropharynx cancer as determined by p16 immunohistochemistry (positive 
vs. negative); HPV status f or participants without oropharynx cancer (eg, cancers of the 
oral cavity, hypopharynx and larynx) is considered HPV negative.
3.ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1).
6.3.3 Blinding
After IA2, the study was unblinded on 16 -Aug-2023 .Original protocol text that is co ntained 
in this section has been retained for reference.
Adouble -blinding technique with in -house blinding will be used. Lenvatinib/matching 
placebo will be packaged identically for Arms 1 and 2 so that blind is maintained .The 
participant, the investigat or, and Sponsor personnel or delegate(s) who are involved in the 
study intervention administration or clinical evaluation of the participants are unaware of the 
intervention assignments.
The treatment identity of pembrolizumab will be open -label ; therefore , the Sponsor, 
investigator, and participant will know the intervention administered.

study.
6.4 Study Intervention Compliance
If there are interruptions in the study intervention schedule or infusion/injection was stopped, 
the details of and reason for any interruption or infusion/injection cessation of study 
intervention will be documented in the participant’s medical record.
Interruptions from the protocol -specified treatment plan for ≥28days for lenvatinib/placebo
require consultation between the investigator and the Sponsor and written documentation of 
the collaborative decision on participant management.
Lenvatinib/placebo:  On Day 1 of each cycle lenvatinib /placebo will be dosed in the clinic, 0 
to 4 hours after pembrolizumab. Lenvatinib/placebo will be taken at home on all other days.
6.5 Concomitant Therapy
If there is a clinical indication for any medications or vaccinations prohibited, the 
investigator must discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor’s Clinical Director. 
The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or 
the participant’s primary physician. However, the decision to continue the participant on 
study intervention requires the mutual agreement of the investigator and the Sponsor.
The following medications and vaccinations are prohibited during the study:
•Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy
•Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol
•Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol
•Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab and lenvatinib
•Radiation therapy
•Live or live -attenuated vaccines within 30 days before the first dose of study intervention 
and while pa rticipating in the study.
Note: Any licensed COVID -19 vaccine (including for Emergency Use) in a particular 
country is allowed in the study as long as they are mRNA vaccines, replication -
incompetent adenoviral vaccines, or inactivated vaccines. These vacci nes will be treated 
just as any other concomitant therapy.
•Refer to Appendix 7 for country -specific requirements.
•Systemic glucocorticoids except when used for the following purposes:
-To modulate symptoms of an AE that is suspected to have an immunologic e tiology
-For the prevention of emesis
-To premedicate for IV contrast allergies

-For chronic systemic replacement not to exceed 10 mg/day predniso ne equivalent
•Other glucocorticoid use except when used for the following purposes:
-For topical use or ocular use
-Intraarticular joint use
-For inhalation in the management of asthma or COPD
If the investigator determines that a participant requires any of the following prohibited 
medications and vaccinations for any reason during the study , study intervention
pembrolizumab+lenvatinib/placebo must be discontinued :
•Systemic antineoplastic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy not 
specified in th is protocol
•Investigational agents other than those specified in this protocol
•Radiation therapy
•Investigational vaccines (ie, those not licensed or approved for Emergency Use) are not 
allowed.
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a participant’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of 
medical care. All concomitant medication swill be recorded on the eCRF including all 
prescription s, OTC products, her bal supplements, and IV medications, and fluids. If changes 
occur during the study period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date 
should also be included on the eCRF.
All concomitant medications received within 28days prior to the first dose of study 
intervention and up to 30 days after the last dose of study intervention should be recorded. 
All concomitant medications administered during SAEs or ECIs are to be recorded. SAEs 
and ECIs are defined in Section 8.4.
6.5.1 Rescue Medications and Sup portive Care
Participants should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the 
treating investigator.
Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with potential immunologic
etiology are outlined along with the dos e modification guidelines in Section 6.6.2 for 
guidelines forlenvatinib/placebo dose modification and supportive care .
6.5.2 Drug Interactions
There are no DDI -related concomitant medication prohibitions or restrictions. Lenvatinib is 
not expected to clinically meaningfully alter exposure to CYP3A4/ P -glycoprotein (Pgp) 
08K59L

substrates based on results from a lenvatinib DDI study with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A 
and Pgp substrate). Clinical studies also showed that co -administration of lenvatinib with 
either inducer s or inhibitors of CYP3A4/Pgp are not of clinical concern.
No drug interaction is expected between pembrolizumab and lenvatinib because of their 
divergent metabolic pathways. Pembrolizumab is a mAb and is primarily catabolized like 
other proteins, while le nvatinib is metabolized by enzymatic (CYP3A and aldehyde oxidase) 
and nonenzymatic processes (LENVIMA® product information).
6.6 Dose Modification (Escalation/Titration/Other)
NOTE: In alignment with the study -specific investigator letter dated 25 -Aug-2023 , all study 
participants still receiving pembrolizumab should continue to receive pembrolizumab 
monotherapy on study and undergo modified protocol study procedures as specified in this 
amendment. Study participation should end after the 3 0-day Safety Follow -up Visit (last 
scheduled visit) with the following exceptions: participants who are potential candidates for 
Second Course treatment will continue in Efficacy Follow -up and all participants in China 
will continue in Efficacy Follow -upand Survival Follow -up. All participants should stop 
ongoing treatment with lenvatinib/placebo.
Exceptions may be requested for lenvatinib for study participants who, in the assessment of 
their study physician, are benefiting from ongoing lenvatinib after c onsulting with the 
Sponsor . This applies to participants currently on pembrolizumab and lenvatinib and 
participants who have discontinued pembrolizumab and are currently continuing lenvatinib 
monotherapy. Participants who are considered by the investigator as candidates for continued 
monotherapy with lenvatinib after completion of 35 cycles of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib 
require a separate communication with the Sponsor. Participants who discontinue 
pembrolizumab prior to completion of Cycle 35 (eg, due to an AE) must discontinue 
lenvatinib at the same time.
Adverse events will be graded using NCI CTCAE Version v5.0. Investigators will decide the 
probability of the event being related to one or both drugs as to whether dose modification of 
one or both drugs is required.
Participants who interrupt or discontinue one drug in the lenvatinib -pembrolizumab 
combination due to toxicity can continue with the other drug in the combination until criteria 
for treatment discontinuation are met (eg, unacceptable toxicity , disease progression).
Refer to Section 6.6.3 for dose modification guidance for overlapping toxicity for the 
pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib combination.

6.6.1 Immune -Related Events and Dose Modification (Withhold, Treat, 
Discontinue)
Dose Modification and Tox icity Management for Immune -related AEs Associated With 
Pembrolizumab
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immune -related response. 
These irAEs may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of 
pembroliz umab treatment and may affect more than one body system simultaneously. 
Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications. 
Based on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed wit h 
interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids ,and/or other supportive 
care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other 
causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be 
included as part of the evaluation.
Dose Modifica tion and Toxicity Management Guidelines for irAEs Associated With 
Pembrolizumab Monotherapy, Coformulations, or IO Combinations are provided in Table 5.
Table 5 Dose Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -related 
Adverse Events Associated With Pembrolizumab Monotherapy, Coformulations, or IO 
Combinations
General instructions:
1.Severe and life -threatening irAEs should be treated with IV corticosteroids followed by oral steroids. 
Other immunosuppressive treatment should begin if the irAEs are not controlled by corticosteroids.
2.Pembrolizumab monotherapy, coformulations, or IO combinations must be permanently discontinued if 
the irAE does not resolve or the corticosteroid dose is not ≤10mg/day within 12 weeks of the last 
treatment.
3.The corticosteroid taper should begin when the irAE is ≤ Grade 1 and continue at least 4 weeks.
4.If pembrolizumab monotherapy, coformulations, or IO combinations have been withheld, treatment may 
resume after the irAE decreased to ≤Grade 1 after corticosteroid taper.

Other Allowed Dose Interruption for Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab may be interrupted for situations other than treatment -related AEs s uch as 
medical/surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy. Participants should 
be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption unless 
otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption sho uld be documented in 
the participant's study record .
6.6.2 Dose Modification with Lenvatinib
Lenvatinib dose reduction and interruption for participants who experience lenvatinib -
pembrolizumab combination therapy -related toxicity will be in accordance with the dose 
modification guidelines described in Table 7. An interruption of study intervention for more 
than 28 days will require Sponsor approval before treatment can be resumed.
The starting dose of lenvatinib is [20 mg/day ]in combination with pembrolizumab . Dose 
reductions of len vatinib occur in succession based on the previous dose level ( 20, 14, 10, and 
8 mg/day ). Any dose reduction below 8 mg/day must be discussed with the Sponsor. Once 
the lenvatinib placebo dose has been reduced, it may not be increased at a later date, unles s 
the dose has been mistakenly decreased; in this situation, the Sponsor’s approval is required 
to increase the dose.

6.6.2.1 Management of Hypertension
Hypertension is a recognized side effect of treatment with drugs inhibiting VEGF signaling. 
Investigators should therefore ensure that participants enrolled to receive treatment with 
lenvatinib have BP of ≤150/90 mm Hg at the time of study entry and, if known to be 
hypertensive, have been on a stable dose of antihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week 
before C1D1. Early detection and effective management of hypertension are important to 
minimize the need for lenvatinib dose interr uptions and reductions.
Regular assessment of BP should be as detailed in the SoA ( Section 1.3.1 and Section 1.3.2 ). 
Hypertension will be graded using NCI CTCAE v5.0, based on BP measurements only (and 
not on the number of antihypertensive medications).
If the participant’s first BP measurement of the current assessment is elevated (ie, systolic BP 
≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg), the BP measurement should be repeated at least 5 
minutes later. One BP assessment is defined as the mean v alue of 2 measurements at least 5 
minutes apart. If the BP assessment (ie, the mean of the 2 BP measurements obtained at least 
5 minutes apart) is elevated (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg), a 
confirmatory assessment should be obtained at least 30 minutes later by performing 2 
measurements (at least 5 minutes apart) to yield a mean value.
Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as elevated BP (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg 
or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg) is confirmed on 2 assessments at least 30 minutes apart. The 
choice of antihypertensive treatment should be individualized to the participant’s clinical 
circumstances and follow standard medical practice. For previously normotensive 
participants, appropriate antihypertensiv e therapy should be started when systolic BP ≥140 
mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg is first observed on 2 assessments at least 30 minutes 
apart. For those participants already on antihypertensive medication, treatment modification 
may be necessary if hypert ension persists .
Lenvatinib should be withheld in any instance where a participant is at imminent risk to 
develop a hypertensive crisis or has uncontrolled hypertension (eg, BP ≥160/100 mm Hg) 
with significant risk factors for severe complications, signifi cant risk factors for cardiac 
disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, or other significant co -morbidities.  Once the participant 
has been on the same antihypertensive medications for at least 48 hours and the BP is 
controlled, lenvatinib should be resumed as de scribed below.
Participants who have had systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥100 mm Hg must have 
their BP monitored on Day 15 (or more frequently as clinically indicated) until systolic BP 
has been ≤150 mm Hg and diastolic BP has been ≤95 mm Hg for 2 c onsecutive treatment 
cycles. If a repeat event of systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥100 mm Hg occurs, the 
participant must resume the Day 15 evaluation until systolic BP has been ≤150 mm Hg and 
diastolic BP has been ≤95 mm Hg for 2 consecutive treatm ent cycles.

The following guidelines should be followed for the management of systolic BP ≥160 mm
Hg or diastolic BP ≥100 mm Hg confirmed on 2 BP assessments at least 30 minutes apart:
1.Continue study drug and institute antihypertensive therapy for partic ipants not already 
receiving this.
2.For those participants already on antihypertensive medication, the dose of the current 
agent may be increased, if appropriate, or 1 or more agents of a different class of 
antihypertensive should be added. Study treatment can be continued without dose 
modification.
3.If systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥100 mm Hg persists despite maximal 
antihypertensive therapy, then lenvatinib administration should be interrupted and 
restarted at 1 dose level reduction only when systo lic BP ≤150 mm Hg and diastolic BP 
≤95 mm Hg and the participant has been on a stable dose of antihypertensive medication 
for at least 48 hours.
-If systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥100 mm Hg recurs on the first dose 
reduction despite optimal managem ent of hypertension with antihypertensive 
medications (either by dose increase or the addition of a different class of 
antihypertensive), then lenvatinib administration should be interrupted and restarted 
at an additional dose reduction only when systolic BP ≤150 mm Hg and diastolic BP 
≤95 mm Hg and the participant has been on a stable dose of antihypertensive 
medication for at least 48 hours. 
-If systolic BP ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥100 mm Hg recurs on the second dose 
reduction despite optimal managemen t of hypertension with antihypertensive 
medications (either by dose increase or the addition of a different class of 
antihypertensive), then lenvatinib administration should be interrupted and restarted 
at a third dose reduction only when systolic BP ≤150 mm Hg and diastolic BP ≤95 
mm Hg and the participant has been on a stable dose of antihypertensive medication 
for at least 48 hours.
-Additional dose reduction should be discussed with the Sponsor.
The following guidelines should be followed for the manage ment of Grade 4 hypertension 
(life threatening consequences):

6.6.2.2 Management of Proteinuria
Regular assessment of proteinuria should be conducted as detailed in the SoA ( Section 1.3 ). 
Guidelines for assessment and management of proteinuria are as follows:
Detection and Confirmation
1.Perform urine dipstick testing or urinalysis per the SoA ( Section 1.3 ). Urine dipstick 
testing is the preferred method for testing for urinary protein, however, urinal ysis may be 
used if the use of urine dipsticks is not feasible.
2.A 24 -hour urine collection initiated as soon as possible and at least within 72 hours (or an 
immediate spot UPCR test) is required in the following situations:
-The first (initial) occurrence o f ≥2+(≥100 mg/dL) proteinuria on urine dipstick (or 
urinalysis) while the participant is receiving lenvatinib .
-A subsequent increase in severity of urine dipstick or urinalysis proteinuria occurring 
on the same lenvatinib dose level
-When there has been a lenvatinib dose reduction and at the new dose level the urine 
protein dipstick result is ≥2+ (≥100 mg/dL).
3.A 24 -hour urine collection (initiated as soon as possible and at least within 72 hours) to 
verify the grade of proteinuria is required when UPCR is ≥2.4.
Grading of Proteinuria
-Grading according to NCI CTCAE v5.0 will be based on the 24 -hour urinary protein 
result if one has been obtained. If the participant has 4+ proteinuria by dipstick 
(≥1000 mg/dL by urinalysis), a 24 -hour urinary protein result is required to confirm 
Grade 3 proteinuria. Management of lenvatinib administration will be based on the 
grade of proteinuria according to Table 7.
Monitoring
-Urine dipstick or urinalysis testing for participants with proteinuria ≥2+ (≥100 
mg/dL) should be performed on Day 15 (or more frequently as clinically indicated) 
until the results have been 1+ (30 mg/dL) or negative for 2 consecutive treatment 
cycles .
-Proteinuria monitoring can be performed at the local laboratory or investigator site, 
but must be managed by the site physician.
-In the event of nephrotic syndrome, lenvatinib must be discontinued .
6.6.2.3 Management of Diarrhea
An anti -diarrheal agent should be recommended to the participant at the s tart of study 
treatment, and participants should be instructed and educated to initiate anti -diarrheal 
treatment at the first onset of soft bowel movements. The choice of anti -diarrheal agent 
should be individualized to the participant’s clinical circumsta nces and follow standard

medical practice. If signs/symptoms of diarrhea persist despite optimal medical management, 
instructions contained in Table 7should be follo wed.
6.6.2.4 Management of Hepatotoxicity
Liver function tests (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], bilirubin 
levels) should be conducted as detailed in the SoA ( Section 1.3.1 and Section 1.3.2 ) and as 
clinically indicated. If signs/symptoms indicating liver injury occur, instructions contained in
Table 7should be followed. Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with 
close monitoring. If hepatic failure (any grade per CTCAE v5) occurs, lenvatinib must be 
discontinued.
6.6.2.5 Management of Thromboembolic Events
Participants should be advised to p ay attention to symptoms suggestive of venous 
thromboembolic events which include acute onset of shortness of breath, dyspnea, chest pain, 
cough, hemoptysis, tachypnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, DVT signs including lower -extremity 
swelling, and warmth to touc h or tenderness. In case any of these symptoms appear, 
participants should be instructed to report such symptoms promptly to the treating physician.  
If a thromboembolic event is confirmed, instructions contained in Table 7should be 
followed. Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close monitoring. If 
a participant experiences a Grade 3 or a life threatening (Grade 4) thromboembolic reaction, 
including pulmonary embolism, lenvatinib /placebo must be discontinued.
Arterial thromboembolic events (eg, new onset, worsening, or unstable angina, myocardial 
infarction, transient ischemic attack, and cerebrovascular accident) of any grade require study 
treatment discontinuation.
6.6.2.6 Management of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome/Reversible 
Encephalopathy Syndrome/ Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy 
Syndrome
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome/Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome/ 
Reversi ble Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (PRES/RPLS) is a neurological 
disorder that can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, altered mental function, 
blindness, and other visual or neurological disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension m ay be 
present. MRI is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES/RPLS. Appropriate measures 
should be taken to control BP. In participants with signs or symptoms of PRES/RPLS, 
instructions in Table 7should be followed.

6.6.2.7 Management of Hypocalcemia
Serum calcium should be monitored per the SoA ( Section 1.3.1 and Section 1.3.2 ). Corrected 
serum calcium should be used to assess the grade of hypocalcemia per CTCAE v5.0, us ing 
the following formula:
Corrected calcium = ([4 –serum albumin in g/dL] × 0.8 + serum calcium)
The formula is not applicable when serum albumin concentration is normal ( ˃4 g/dL); in 
such situations, the total (uncorrected) serum calcium should be used instead. 
Hypocalcemia should be treated per institutional guidelines (eg, using appropriate calcium, 
magnesium, and Vitamin D supplementation) until resolution.
6.6.2.8 Management of Hemorrhage
Instructions in Table 7should be followed for the management of hemorrhage. Either resume 
at a reduced dose or discontinue lenvatinib depending on the severity and persistence of 
hemorrhage.
6.6.2.9 Management of Gastroint estinal Perforation or Fistula Formation
Lenvatinib should be discontinued in any participants who develop gastrointestinal 
perforation of any grade or Grade 4 fistula.
Refer to Appendix 7 for country -specific requirements.
6.6.2.10 Management of QT Prolongation
Lenvatinib should be withheld in the event of development of QT interval prolongation 
greater than 500 msec. Lenvatinib should be resumed at a reduced dose when QTc 
prolongation is resolved to <480 msec or baseline. Monitor potassium, calcium and 
magnesium, and replenish as appropriate.
6.6.2.11 Management of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw
Perform an oral examination prior to treatment with lenvatinib and periodically during 
lenvatinib treatment. Advise participants regarding good oral hygiene practices. Avoid 
invasive dent al procedures, if possible, while on lenvatinib treatment, particularly in 
participants at higher risk. For participants requiring invasive dental procedures, 
discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk of ONJ. Withhold 
lenvatinib if ON J develops and restart based on clinical judgement of adequate resolution 
(See Section 6.6. 4).

6.6.3 Dose Modifications for Overlapping Toxicities
Based on the known toxicity profiles of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib, certain treatment -
related AEs are uniquely associated with one drug versus the other. For example, 
hypertension, arterial thrombotic events, proteinuria, and hemorrhagic events are known risks 
for lenvatinib treatment, while immune -related AEs are risks for pembrolizumab treatment. 
However, certain AEs, such as such as diarrhea, hypothyroidism, and liver enzyme elevation, 
may be initially considered attributable to either study drug. Therefore, evaluation of 
attribution is important for determining the study drug most likely related to the AE, or an
alternative etiology, and subsequently proper clinical management. The following aspects 
should be considered:
1.Timing of AE onset
Since lenvatinib is dosed daily and continuously due to a relatively short half -life (28 
hours), and pembrolizumab is dosed Q 3W due to a long half -life, lenvatinib can be 
interrupted to assess whether an AE improves/resolves with dechallenge (ie, interruption 
of treatment) based on the following two scenarios:
-If an AE is identified during a treatment cycle (ie, between 2 pembro lizumab doses), 
only lenvatinib dose interruption is needed. 
-If an AE is identified at the beginning of a treatment cycle, lenvatinib can be 
interrupted and dosing of pembrolizumab should be held.
If the participant recovers from an AE in response to lenvatinib interruption (ie, positive 
dechallenge), the event is more likely to be related to lenvatinib. Otherwise, after 
excluding other alternative explanations, an immune -related AE should be consid ered. 
2.Severity of AE
If an AE is suspected to be treatment related and is severe/life threatening at the time of 
onset or is rapidly worsened, action including interrupting both drugs and initiating 
treatment with a corticosteroid (with exception of hypot hyroidism, TIDM) and other 
supportive care should be taken promptly.
3.Participants receiving the combination therapy (pembrolizumab + lenvatinib) must 
discontinue study therapy if any of the following occur:
-ALT or AST >5 X ULN for more than 2 weeks.
Pembrolizumab will have already been permanently discontinued per Table 5, but 
lenvatinib may be administered at a reduced dose by the time this criterion is met and 
must be permanently discontinued immediately.
-ALT or AST >3 X ULN and (TBL >2 X ULN or INR >1.5).
Although Table 5advises pembrolizumab to be withheld (interrupted), a nd Table 7
advises lenvatinib to have no dose modification or a reduction, if this criterion is met, 
both drugs must be permanently discontinued immediately.

6.6.4 Other Allowed Dose Interruptions
If the participant is receiving treatment with lenvatinib and requires surgery during the study, 
the stop time and restart time of lenvatinib should be as follows:
•For minor procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 2 days before the procedure and restart it at 
least 2 days after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no risk of bleeding.
•For major procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 1 week (5 half -lives) prior to surgery and 
then restart it at least 2 weeks after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no 
risk of bleeding.
•For scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, stop lenvatinib for at least 1 
week before the procedure, then restart lenvatinib when deemed clinically appropriate.
6.7 Second Course
All participants who stopped study intervention with SD or better may be eligible for up to an 
additional 17 cycles of pembrolizumab (approximately 1 year) if they progress after initial 
treatment. This retreatment is the Second Course of this study, and a participant is eligible if 
the following conditions are met : 
Either
•Stopped initial study intervention after attaining an investigator determined confirmed 
CR based on RECIST 1.1, and
-Was treated with at least 8 cycles of study intervention before discon tinuing 
treatment, and
-Received at least 2 treatments with pembrolizumab beyond the date when the initial 
CR was declared
OR
•Had SD, PR, or CR and stopped study intervention after completion of 35 administrations 
(approximately 2 years) of study intervent ion for reasons other than disease progression 
or intolerability
AND
•Experienced centrally -verified radiographic disease progression by RECIST 1.1 after 
stopping initial treatment, and
-No new anticancer treatment was administered after the last dose of study 
intervention, and

China will be considered for Second Course after experiencing centrally -verified 
radiographic disease progression by RECIST 1.1.)
Participants who discontinue pembrolizumab after attaining CR or who complete treatment 
with pembrolizumab after 35 cycles will continue to receive lenvatinib/placebo alone until 
disease progression is verified by BICR, development of unacceptable toxicity, or 
withdrawal of consent. Participants who are receiving lenvatinib/placebo at the time disease 
progression is verified may continue to receive lenvatinib/placebo during Second Course 
treatment at the discretion of the investigator. Participants who disco ntinue 
lenvatinib/placebo before initiation of Second Course treatment will not restart 
lenvatinib/placebo.
6.8 Intervention After the End of the Study
Upon study termination , participants are to be discontinued and may be enrolled in an 
extension study using pembrolizumab in combination with compound (eg, lenvatinib) if 
available .
6.9 Clinical Supplies Disclosure
The emergency unblinding call center will use the intervention/randomization schedule for 
the study to unblind participants and to unmask study intervention identity of lenvatinib or 
matching placebo . The emergency unblinding call center should only be used in cases of 
emergency (see Section 8.1.10 ). If the emergency unblinding call center is not available for a 
given site in this study, the centr al electronic intervention randomization system (IRT) should 
be used to unblind participants and to unmask study intervention identity. The Sponsor will

7 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT 
WITHDRAWAL
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention
Original protocol text that is contained in this section and the following sections has been 
retained for reference .
Discontinuation of stud y intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study.
As certain data on clinical events beyond study intervention discontinuation may be 
important to the study, they must be collected through the participant’s last scheduled follow -
up, even if the participant has discontinued study intervention. Therefore, all participants 
who discontinue study intervention before completion of theprotocol -specified treatment 
period will still continue to be monitored in the study and participate in the study visi ts and 
procedures as specified in Section 1.3 and Section 8.11.5and 8.1 1.6unless the participant 
has withdrawn from the study Section 7.2.
Participants may discontinue study intervention at any time for any reason or be discontinued 
from the study intervention at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect 
occur. In addition, a participant may be discontinued from study intervention by the 
investigator or the Sponsor if study intervention is inappropriate, the study plan is violate d, or 
for administrative and/or other safety reasons.
A participant must be discontinued from study intervention, but continue to be monitored in 
the study for any of the following reasons:
•The participant or participant’s legally acceptable representative requests to discontinue 
study intervention.
•Any prolonged interruption of study intervention beyond the permitted periods, for irAE 
management or other allowed dose interruptions, as noted in Section 6.6.1, require 
Sponsor consultation prior to restarting treatment. If treatment will not be restarted, the 
participant will continue to be monitored in the study and the reason for discontinuation 
of study intervention will be recorded in the medical record.
•The participant has a medical conditio n or personal circumstance which, in the opinion of 
the investigator and/or Sponsor, placed the participant at unnecessary risk from continued 
administration of study intervention.
•The participant has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test.
•The particip ant has a positive urine drug screen at any time during the course of the 
study.

discretion of the investigator and after consultation with the Sponsor and receiving signed 
informed consent. 
-As of Amendment 05: Central tumor response assessments will no longer be 
performed .  Participants who are receiving study intervention will be assessed locally by 
the investigator for disease progression per the protocol schedule.  Scans will not be sent 
to the iCRO.   (Note: participants in China will continue to have BICR tumor response
assessments and will continue to submit scans to the iCRO .)
-Participants with RECIST 1.1 disease progression per local investigator assessment 
may continue pembrolizumab monotherapy at the discretion of the investigator and after 
consultation with the S ponsor and receiving signed informed consent.
-Participants with RECIST 1.1 disease progression must discontinue lenvatinib.
•Any progression or recurrence of malignancy, or any occurrence of another malignancy 
that requires active treatment.
•Recurrent Gra de 2 pneumonitis
•Any study intervention -related toxicity specified as a reason for permanent 
discontinuation as defined in the guidelines for dose modification due to AEs in Table 5, 
Table 6, or Table 7.
•Discontinuation of pembrolizumab may be considered for participants who have attained 
a confirmed CR and have been treated for at least 8 cycles (at least 24 weeks), receiving 
at least 2 doses of pembrolizumab beyond the date when the initial CR was declared. 
These participa nts may be eligible for Second Course treatment described in Section 6.7.  
Participants who stop pembrolizumab due to CR will continue to receive 
lenvatinib/placebo until PD verified by BICR or until a discontinuation criterion is met, if 
lenvatinib/placeb o was not previously discontinued.
As of Amendment 05: Participants who are considered by the investigator as candidates 
for continued monotherapy with lenvatinib after stopping pembrolizumab due to CR 
require a separate communication with the Sponsor .
•Com pletion of 35 treatments (approximately 2 years) with pembrolizumab
Note: The number of treatments is calculated starting with the first dose. Participants who 
stop the combination or pembrolizumab after receiving 35 doses may be eligible for 
retreatment i f they progress after stopping study intervention provided they meet the 
requirements detailed in Section 6.7. Participants receiving lenvatinib/placebo may 
continue to receive lenvatinib/placebo after completion of 35 treatments with 
pembrolizumab. Partic ipants may be retreated in the Second Course Phase (Retreatment) 
for up to an additional 17 cycles (approximately 1 year) of pembrolizumab.
As of Amendment 05:  Participants who are considered by the investigator as candidates

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
•Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA.
•Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study conduct.
•The investigator is responsible for ensuring that procedures are conducted by 
appropriately qualified (by education, training, and experience) staff. Delegation of 
study -site personnel responsibilities will be documented in the Investigator Trial File 
Binder (or equivalent).
•All study -related medical (or dental) decisions must be made by an investigator who is a 
qualified physician (or dentist when appropriate) .
•All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.
•Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count) and obtained before providing documented informed consent may be used for 
screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure smeet the protocol -specified 
criteria and were perfo rmed within the time frame defined in the SoA.
•Additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by the investigator and or the 
Sponsor for reasons related to participant safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing 
may be potentially sensitive in n ature (eg, HIV, hepatitis C), and thus local regulations 
may require that additional informed consent be obtained from the participant. In these 
cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.
The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study 
willbe provided in the Procedures Manual.
Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with 
the samples.
8.1 Administrative and General Procedures

their legally acceptable representative) before participation in the study.
The initial ICF, any subsequent revised ICF, and any written information provided to the 
participant must receive the IRB/IEC’s approval/favorable opinion in advance of use. The 
participant or his/her legally acceptable representative should be informed in a timely manner 
if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the participant’s willingness to 
continue participation in the study. The communication of this information will be provided 
and documented via a revised consent f orm or addendum to the original consent form that 
captures the participant’s or the participant’s legally acceptable representative’s dated 
signature.
If the investigator recommends continuation of study intervention beyond disease 
progression, the partici pant or their legally acceptable representative will be asked to provide 
documented informed consent.
Specifics about the study and the study population are to be included in the study informed 
consent form.
Informed consent will adhere to IRB/IEC requirem ents, applicable laws and regulations, and

8.1.4 Medical History
A medical history will be obtained by the investigator or qualified designee. The medical 
history will collect all active conditions and any condition di agnosed within the prior 
10years that the investigator considers to be clinically important. Details regarding the 
disease for which the participant has enrolled in this study will be recorded separately and 
not listed as medical history.
If a medical con dition is diagnosed at the time of screening due to the physical examination, 
laboratory tests, radiologic assessment, other assessment, and/or a combination of these 
evaluations, the medical condition is to be recorded as a baseline condition along with t he 
participant’s other medical history unless due to any protocol -specified intervention (eg, 
procedure, washout ,or run -in treatment including placebo run -in).
8.1.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications Review
8.1.5.1 Prior Medications
The i nvestigator or qualified design ee will review prior medication use, including any 
protocol -specified washout requirement, and record prior medication taken by the participant 
within 28 days before the first dose of study intervention . Treatment for the disease for which 
the participant has enrolled in this study will be recorded separately and willnot be listed as a 
prior medication.
Medications taken 28 days before the first dose of Second Course study intervention will be 
recorded.
8.1.5.2 Concomitant Medications
The investigator or qualified designee will record medication, if any, taken by the participant 
during the study through the Safety Follow -up Visit. Concomitant medications will be 
recorded for 30 days after the last dose of study intervention.
In addition, concomitant medications wil l be recorded during Second Course treatment, and 
for 30 days after the last dose of Second Course study intervention.
8.1.6 Assignment of Screening Number
All consented participants will be given a unique screening number that will be used to 
identify the participant for all procedures that occur before randomization . Each participant 
will be assigned only 1 screening number. Screening numbers must not be reused f or 
different participants.
8.1.7 Assignment of Treatment/Randomization Number
All eligible participan ts will be randomly allocated and will receive a randomization number. 
The randomization number identifies the participant for all procedures occurring after

randomization . Once a randomization number is assigned to a participant, it can never be 
reassigne d to another participant.
A single participant cannot be assigned more than 1 randomization number.
8.1.8 Study Intervention Administration
It is strongly preferred that participants receive the first dose of study intervention on the day 
of randomization. Study intervention should begin within 3 days of randomization.
Pembrolizumab : Study intervention(s) will be administered by the investigator and/or study 
staff according to the specifications within the pharmacy manual.
Lenvatinib/placebo :  Lenvatinib/placebo will be administered by the investigator and/or 
study staff in the clinic on Day 1 of each cycle, 0 to 4 hours after pembrolizumab. All other 
lenvatinib/placebo doses will be taken at home. Lenvatinib/placebo will be administered 
accor ding to the specifications in the Pharmacy Manual. An extemporaneous suspension of 
lenvatinib capsules should be used for participants unable to swallow capsules, as detailed in 
the Pharmacy Manual. Please refer to Section 8.1.8.1 for further details.
8.1.8.1 Timi ng of Dose Administration
Pembrolizumab : Pembrolizumab will be administered as a 30 -minute IV infusion on Day 1 
of each 21 -day cycle. Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close 
to 30 minutes as possible. However, given the vari ability of infusion pumps from site to site, 
a window of –5 minutes to +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 30 minutes: –5 
min/+10 min).
After Cycle 1 Day 1, pembrolizumab may be administered up to 3 days before or after the 
scheduled Day 1 of e ach subsequent cycle due to administrative reasons.
Lenvatinib/placebo : Lenvatinib 20 mg (two 10 -mg capsules) or matching placebo will be 
taken orally with water (with or without food) once daily at approximately the same time 
each day in each 21 -day cycle . Day 1 of each cycle will be dosed in the clinic, 0 -4 hours after 
pembrolizumab.
If a lenvatinib/placebo dose is missed and cannot be taken within 12 hours, then that dose 
will be skipped, and the next dose will be taken at the usual time of administratio n.
Lenvatinib capsules should be swallowed whole. Alternatively, the capsules can be dissolved 
in a small glass of liquid (ie, water or apple juice) if a participant is unable to swallow or has 
a feeding tube. See the Pharmacy Manual for additional informa tion.
8.1.8.2 Compliance
Lenvatinib compliance will be calculated by the Sponsor based on the drug accountability 
documented by the site staff and monitored by the Sponsor/designee. The objective is 100%

compliance and investigators and their staff should evaluate compliance at each visit and take 
appropriate steps to optimize compliance.
8.1.9 Discontinuation and Withdrawal
Participants who discontinue study intervention before completion of the treatment period 
should be encouraged to continue to be followed for all re maining study visits as outlined in 
the SoA .
Participants who withdraw from the study should be encouraged to complete all applicable 
activities scheduled for the End-of-Treatment visit at the time of withdrawal. Any AEs that 
are present at the time of wit hdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety 
requirements outlined in Section 8.4.
8.1.10 Participant Blinding/Unblinding
After efficacy IA2, the study was unblinded on 16 -Aug-2023 .Original protocol text that is 
contained in this section has been retained for reference .
STUDY INTERVENTION IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION IS TO BE UNMASKED 
ONLY IF NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE PARTICIPANT. EVERY 
EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE NOT TO UNBLIND.
Foremergency situations where the investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent 
with local requirements) needs to identify the intervention used by a participant and/or the 
dosage administered, he/she will contact the emergency unblinding call cen ter by telephone 
and make a request for emergency unblinding. As requested by the investigator or medically 
qualified designee, the emergency unblinding call center will provide the information to 
him/her promptly and report unblinding to the Sponsor. Befo re contacting the emergency 
unblinding call center to request unblinding of a participant’s intervention assignment, the 
investigator who is a qualified physician should make reasonable attempts to enter the
toxicity grade of the AEs observed, the relation to study intervention, the reason thereof, etc, 
in the medical record. If it is not possible to record this assessment in the medical record 
before the unblinding, the unblinding should not be delayed.
If unblinding has occurred, the circumstances around the unblinding (eg, date, reason, and 
person performing the unblinding) must be documented promptly, and the Sponsor Clinical 
Director notified as soon as possible.
Once an emergency unblinding has taken place, the investigator, site personnel, and Sponsor
personnel may be unblinded so that the appropriate follow -up medical care can be provided 
to the participant.
Nonemergency Unblinding

centrally -verified PD and study intervention must be permanently discontinued for 
nonemergency unblinding to be considered.
For nonemergency unblinding (eg, after cases of centrally -verified PD and treatment 
discontinuation) IRT should be used to unblind the participant’s treatment assignment. The 
emergency unblinding call center should not be used for this purpose.
Participants whose treatment assignment has been unblinded for any reason will continue to 
be monitored in the study.
8.1.11 Calibration of Equipment
The investigator or qualified designee has the responsibility to ensure that any device or 
instrument used for a clinical evaluation/test during a clinical study that provi des information 
about inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or safety or efficacy parameters shall be suitably 
calibrated and/or maintained to ensure that the data obtained are reliable and/or reproducible. 
Documentation of equipment calibration must be retaine d as source documentation at the 
study site.
8.1.12 Tumor Tissue for Biomarker Status
During the screening period, a tumor sample for each participant is required and is to be:
•A newly obtained core orincisional biopsy of a tumor lesion, which was not previously 
irradiated
Or
•An archival tumor tissue sample if a new biopsy is unavailable (depending on protocol 
requirements)
FFPE tissue blocks are preferred to slides. Newly obtained biopsies are preferred to arc hived 
tissue.
Details pertaining to tumor tissue submission can be found in the Procedures Manual .
The central laboratory will use the tissue sample to ascertain PD -L1 status using the PD -L1 
IHC 22C3 pharmDx (Investigational Use Only) diagnostic kit. The d iagnostic test is identical 
to the US FDA -approved PD -L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx diagnostic kit except it is labeled IUO. 
The PD -L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay kit is currently approved to select participants with 
HNSCC for treatment with pembrolizumab.
The PD -L1 CPS1 result will be unmasked to the site.

8.2 Efficacy Assessments
8.2.1 Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease
Throughout this section, the term ‘scan’refers to any medical imaging data used to assess 
tumor burden and may include cross -sectional imaging (such as CT o r MRI), medical 
photography, or other methods as specified in this protocol.
As of Amendment 05: Central tumor response assessments will be discontinued. Imaging 
scans will no longer be submitted to the iCRO nor read by BICR. Participants still on study 
intervention and participants in Efficacy Follow -up should continue tumor imagi ngand 
investigator assessments of imaging per protocol . (Note: participants in China will continue 
to have BICR tumor response assessments and will continue to submit scans to the iCRO.)
Original protocol text that is contained in this section has been r etained for reference.
In addition to survival, efficacy will be assessed based on evaluation of scan changes in 
tumor burden over time, until the participant is discontinued from the study or goes into 
survival follow -up. The process for scan collection a nd transmission to the iCRO can be 
found in the SIM. Tumor scans by CT are strongly preferred. For the abdomen and pelvis, 
contrast -enhanced MRI may be used when CT with iodinated contrast is contraindicated, or 
when mandated by local practice. The same sc an technique should be used in a participant 
throughout the study to optimize the reproducibility of the assessment of existing and new 
tumor burden and improve the accuracy of the response assessment based on scans.
Note: For the purposes of assessing tumor scans, the term “investigator” refers to the local 
investigator at the site and/or the radiological reviewer at the site or at an offsite facility. 
If brain scans are performed, magnetic resonance imaging is prefe rred; however, CT imaging 
will be acceptable, if MRI is medically contraindicated.
Bone scans may be performed to evaluate bone metastases. Any supplemental scans 
performed to support a positive or negative bone scan, such as plain x-rays acquired for 
correlation, should also be submitted to the iCRO.
Expedited confirmation of measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 by BICR at Screening 
will be used to determine participant eligibility. Confirmation by the BICR that the 
participant’s imaging shows at least 1 lesion that is appropriate for selection as a target lesion 
per RECIST 1.1 is required before participant randomization.
All scheduled scans for participants will be submitted to the iCRO. In addition, a scan that is 
obtained at an unscheduled time point, for any reason (including suspicion of progression or 
other clinical reason), should also be submitted to the iCRO if it shows disease progression, 
or if it is used to support a response assessment. All scans acquired within the protocol -
specified window of time around a scheduled scan visit are to be classified as pertaining to 
that visit.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
When the investigator identifies radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1, the iCRO will 
verify this progression and email the results to the study site and Sponsor. In clinically stable 
participants, imaging should continue until PD has been verified by BICR (if initial site -
assessed PD was not verified by BICR, each subsequent scan must be submitted to iCRO 
with verification of PD request until PD has been verified by B ICR).
8.2.1.1 Initial Tumor Scans
Initial tumor scans at Screening must be performed within 28 days before the date of 
randomization. Any scan obtained after Cycle 1 Day 1 cannot be included in the screening 
assessment. The site must review the screening scans to confirm the participant has 
measurable disease per RECIST 1.1.
The Screening scans must be submitted to the iCRO for confirmation of measurable disease 
per RECIST 1.1 for eligibility before randomization .
Tumor scan performed as part of routine clinical management is acceptable for use as 
screening tumor scan if it is of diagnostic quality and performed within 28days before the 
date of randomization and can be assessed by the iCRO for confirmation of measurable 
disease.
If brain scans are required to document the stability of existing metastases, the brain scan 
should be acquired during screening. The specific methods permitted for this study are 
described in the SIM.
8.2.1.2 Tumor Scans During the Study
The first on -study s can should be performed at Week 6 (42 to 49 days window) from the date 
of randomization. Subsequent tumor scans should be performed every 6 weeks (42 days ± 7 
days) or more frequently if clinically indicated. After 48 weeks, participants who remain on 
treatment will have scans performed every 9 weeks (63 days ± 7 days). Scan timing should 
follow calendar days and should not be adjusted for delays in cycle starts. Scans should 
continue to be performed until disease progression is identified by the investigat or and 
verified by the BICR, the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or death, 
whichever occurs first.
Treatment beyond centrally -verified PD per RECIST 1.1 may be permitted at the discretion 
of the investigator after consultation wit h the Sponsor and receiving signed informed 
consent. Participants who continue treatment beyond centrally -verified PD must continue 
tumor assessments as described in the SoA (Section 1.3.1). Investigator assessments are to be 
documented on the eCRF, but sc ans are not to be submitted to the iCRO. Further progression 
and discontinuation of study intervention are to be determined by the investigator.
Objective response should be confirmed by a repeat scan performed at least 4 weeks after the 
first indication o f a response is observed. Participants will then return to the regular schedule 
scans, starting with the next scheduled scan time point. Participants who receive additional 
scan for confirmation do not need to undergo the next scheduled scan if it is fewer than 4 
weeks later; scans may resume at the subsequent scheduled time point.

PRODUCT: MK-7902 118
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
On-study brain scan should be performed if clinically indicated or to confirm CR (if other 
lesions indicate CR and brain lesions existed at baseline).
8.2.1.3 End-of-treatment and Follo w-up Tumor Scans
As of Amendment 05: follow -up tumor imaging is only required for participants who are 
candidates for Second Course treatment .Imaging scans will no longer be submitted to the 
iCRO nor read by BICR. Original protocol text that is contained in this section has been 
retained for reference. (Note: participants in China will continue to have BICR tumor 
response assessments and will continue to submit scans to the iCRO.)
If participants discontinue study intervention without documented disease pr ogression, every 
effort is to be made to monitor disease status by acquiring tumor scans using the same 
schedule calculated from the date of randomization, refer to Section 8.2.1.2 .
Scans are to be continued until one of the following conditions are met:
•disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 verified by BICR
•the start of a new anticancer treatment
•pregnancy
•death
•withdrawal of consent
•the end of the study
8.2.1.4 Second Course (Retreatment) Tumor Scans
Tumor scans must be performed within 28 days before restarting study intervention with 
pembrolizumab .
If disease progression has been verified by BICR for the First Course, the Second Course 
may be initiated. The disease progression scan may be used as the Second Course baseline 
scan if performed within 4 weeks prior to dosing and meets scan standards.
The first scan should be performed at 6weeks ( 42-49 days ) after restarting study 
intervention. Subsequent tumor scans are to be performed every 6weeks ( 42days ±7 days ) 
or more frequently, if clinically indicated. After 48 weeks, scans are to be performed every 9 
weeks ( ±7 days ) or more frequently, if clinically indicated.
Scans are to be performed until:
•disease progression
•the start of a new anticancer tre atment
•withdrawal of consent

MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
•death
•completion of Second Course
•or notification by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first
If participants discontinue study intervention, tumor scans are to be performed at 
discontinuation (±4 -week window) unless previous scans were obtained within 4 weeks of 
discontinuation. If participants discontinue study intervention due to documented disease 
progression, this is the final required tumor scan.
If participants discontinue study intervention without documented d isease progression, every 
effort is to be made to monitor disease status by acquiring tumor scans every 6 weeks (42 
days [±7 days]) until the start of a new anticancer treatment, disease progression, death, or 
the end of the study, whichever occurs first.
8.2.1.5 RECIST 1.1 Assessment of Disease
As of Amendment 05: Central tumor response assessments will be discontinued. Imaging 
scans will no longer be submitted to the iCRO nor read by BICR. How ever, participants in 
China will continue to have BICR tumor response a ssessments and will continue to submit 
scans to the iCRO .
RECIST 1.1 will be used as the primary measure for assessment of tumor response, date of 
disease progression, and as a basis for all protocol guidelines related to disease status (eg, 
discontinuatio n of study intervention). Although RECIST 1.1 references a maximum of 5 
target lesions in total and 2 per organ, this protocol allows a maximum of 10 target lesions in 
total and 5 per organ, if clinically relevant to enable a broader sampling of tumor burd en.
Upon investigator -assessed disease progression, the indicative scan(s) is/are to be submitted 
immediately to iCRO for BICR verification of progression. After submission of scan(s), the 
iCRO will email the assessment to the site and Sponsor.
If disease progression is not verified, the process continues as follows:
•If participant is clinically stable, continue study intervention per protocol
-continue scans per protocol schedule (the next scheduled scan should be ≥4 weeks 
from most recent scan acqu ired)
-send scans to iCRO
-continue local assessment
-do not change investigator assessment of progression
-if subsequent scan(s) indicate progression, request verification from iCRO
•If the participant is not clinically stable, best medical practice is to be a pplied
Before stopping study intervention or imaging or starting new anticancer therapy in a 
participant who is clinically stable, communication with the Sponsor is required.

If disease progression is verified, the process continues as follows:
•investigator judgment will determine action
•if the participant is clinically stable and study intervention is to continue, communication 
with the Sponsor is required and a reconsent addendum must be signed
•obtain scans locally per original protocol schedul e
•do not send scans to iCRO
Figure 5illustrates the study intervention decision process involving verification of disease 
progression for participants.
•For the purpo se of this decision process, lack of clinical stability is defined as:
-unacceptable toxicity
-clinical signs or symptoms indicating clinically significant disease progression
-decline in performance status
-rapid disease progression or threat to vital organs or critical anatomical sites (eg, CNS 
metastasis, respiratory failure due to tumor compression, spinal cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention

8.2.2 Patient -reported Outcomes
As of Amendment 05: ePRO assessments will be discontinued.  Original protocol text that is 
contained in this section has been retained for reference.
Itis a best practice and strongly recommended that ePROs are administered before any other 
visit procedures and in the order listed in the SoA, starting with EuroQoL EQ -5D-5L. 
Collection begins at C1 and continues until C35 or treatment discontinuation, wh ichever 
occurs first. 
The PRO questionnaires will be administered:
•Before dosing at Day1, Cycle 1, and then  
•Day 1 of every cycle from Cycle 1 through Cycle 9, then 
•Day 1 of every other cycle through Cycle 17 (C11, C13, C15, C17), then 
•Every 3 cycles t hrough Cycle 35 (C20, C23, C26, C29, C32, C35). 
•Obtain at EOT and Safety FU (if EOT and Safety FU occur before C35).
If the EOT visit happens before the end of the study, PROs will be administered at EOT visit.
PROs will also be administered at the 30 -day Safety Follow -up visit. In the event the EOT 
visit is combined with the 30 -day Safety Follow -up visit, only the PRO assessments for the 
EOT visit will be completed.
It is best practice and strongly recommended that ePROs are administered to randomized 
participants before drug administration, AE evaluation, and disease status notification. If the 
participant does not complete the ePROs at a scheduled time point, the MISS _MODE form 
must be completed to capture the reason the assessment was not performed.
8.3 Safety Assessments
The total amount of blood/tissue to be drawn/collected over the course of the study (from pre 
study to poststudy visits), including approximate blood/tissue volumes drawn/collected by 
visit and by sample type per participant, can be found in the laboratory or study procedures 
manual.
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA.
8.3.1 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination will be conducted by an investigator or medically qualified 
designee (consistent wit h local requirements) per institutional standard. Height and weight 
will also be measured and recorded.

MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
A brief directed physical examination will be conducted by an investigator or medically 
qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) per institutional standard.
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.
8.3.1.1 Full Physical Examination
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam ination during 
the Screening period. Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical 
history. The time points for full physical exams are described in Section 1.3 . After the first 
dose of study intervention, new clinically significant abnormal f indings and changes from 
Screening physical examination findings will be recorded as AEs.
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.
8.3.1.2 Directed Physical Examination
For cycles that do not required a fu ll physical exam ination as defined in Section 1.3 , the 
investigator or qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam ination as clinically 
indicated prior to study intervention administration. New clinically significant abnormal 
findings should b e recorded as AEs.
8.3.2 Vital Signs
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at Screening, before the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment and during the Safety Follow -up visit, as 
specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
Vital signs i nclude temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, weight, and blood pressure. 
Height will be measured at Screening only.
•BP and heart rate will be measured after the participant has been resting for 5 minutes. 
All BP measurements should be performed on th e same arm, preferably by the same 
person. 
•Only 1 BP measurement is needed for participants with systolic BP <140 mm Hg and 
diastolic BR <90 mm Hg. If the participant’s initial BP is elevated (ie, systolic BP ≥140 
mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg), the BP measurement should be repeated at least 5 
minutes later. One BP assessment is defined as the mean value of 2 measurements at least 
5 minutes apart. If the BP assessment (ie, the mean of the 2 BP measurements obtained at 
least 5 minutes apart) shows an elev ated BP (systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic BP 
≥90 mm Hg), a confirmatory assessment should be obtained at least 30 minutes later by 
performing 2 measurements (at least 5 minutes apart) to yield a mean value.

•Under exceptional circumstances, participants will have the option of having BP 
measured between visits obtained locally by a health care professional. A diary will be 
provided as a tool to aid the participant in collecting BP evaluations between study visits. 
8.3.3 Electrocardiograms
Electrocardiograms will be obtained as designated in the SoA (Section 1.3). Complete, 
standardized, 12 -lead ECG recordings that permit all 12 leads to be displayed on a single 
page with an accompanying lead II rhythm strip below the customary 3 × 4 lead format are to 
be used . In addition to a rhythm strip, a minimum of 3 full complexes should be recorded 
from each lead simultaneously. Participants must be in the recumbent position for a period of 
5 minutes prior to the ECG .The Fridericia correction method for calculating QTc will be 
used.
An ECG abnormality may meet the criteria of an AE as described in this protocol (see 
Appendix 3) and the CRF Completion Guidelines. In these instances, the AE corresponding 
to the ECG abno rmality will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.
QTc prolongation has been seen in some lenvatinib studies. Monitor electrocardiograms 
every cycle (as specified in the Schedule of Assessments) in patients with congenital long QT 
syndrome, congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or those who are taking drugs known 
to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Refer to the lenvatinib 
IB.
8.3.4 Echocardiogram or Multiple Gated Acquisition Scan
A MUGA scan (using technetium -based tracer) or an echocardiogram will be performed to 
assess LVEF as designated in the SoA ( Section 1.3). MUGA or echocardiogram scans should 
be performed locally in accordance with the institution’s standard practice. MUGA scans are 
the preferred modality; however, whichever modality is used for an individual participant at 
baseline should be repeated for all subsequent LVEF assessments for that participant. LVEFs 
as assessed by the institution will be entered onto the CRF. Investigator assessment will be 
based upon institutional reports.
Refer to Appendix 7 for country -specific requirements.
8.3.5 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for 
the timing and frequency.
•The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) 
must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically 
relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory 
reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless 
judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condi tion.

•All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2 , must be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory or study procedures manual and the SoA .
•If laboratory values from nonprotocol -specified laboratory assessments performed at th e 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in study participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the results must be recorded in the appropriate CRF (eg, SLAB).
•For any laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation In the study or within 30days after the last dose of study intervention, every 
attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the values ret urn to normal or 
baseline or if a new baseline is established as determined by the investigator .
Details regarding specific laboratory procedures/assessments to be performed in this study 
are provided below. The total amount of blood/tissue to be drawn/co llected over the course 
of the study (from prestudy to poststudy visits), including approximate blood/tissue volumes 
drawn/collected by visit and by sample type per participant can be found in the Procedures 
Manual .

8.3.5.1 Laboratory Safety Evaluations (Hematology, Chemistry and Urinalysis)
Laboratory tests for hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis are specified in Appendix 2 .Refer 
to Section 6.6 for required dose modifications for drug -related laboratory AEs.
8.3.5.1.1 Hematology and Clinical Chemistry
Hematology (CBC with differential) and clinical chemistry will be performed within 7 days 
before the first dose of study intervention. Results from Screening laboratory tests must be 
reviewed before rand omization to confirm eligibility. Labs obtained and reviewed on C1D1 
before randomization may also be used as the screening value to determine eligibility.
In subsequent cycles, hematology and clinical chemistry will be performed within 3 days 
before dosin g, and results must be reviewed before administration of study intervention.
For sites not able to test lipase locally, lipase testing will be performed using central 
laboratory and within 3 days of each subsequent cycle. Participants may be dosed while 
lipase test results are pending, however the results must be reviewed by the investigator when 
available.
8.3.5.1.2 Urine Dipstick Testing/Urinalysis
Urine dipstick testing and urinalysis will be performed locally within 7 days before the start 
of study intervention. Results must be reviewed before randomization to confirm eligibility.
Urinalysis obtained and reviewed on C1D1 before randomization may also be used as the 
screening value to determine eligibility. If 24 -hour urine collection for quantitative

assessment of proteinuria is required, randomization and C1D1 is postponed to after 
proteinuria result is available .
After Screening, urine dipstick testing will be performed within 3 days before Day 1 of every 
cycle while participants are taking lenvatinib/placebo. Refer to Section 6.6.2.2 for additional 
testing and monitoring requirements if proteinuria is detected. 
Urinalysis will be performed for all participants according to the SoA. For cycles where 
urinalysis is required, urinalysis will be performed within 3 days before dosing, and results 
must be reviewed before administration of study intervention.
8.3.5.1.3 Thyroid Func tion Testing
The screening blood sample for thyroid function testing will be obtained within 7 days before 
the first dose of study intervention. Labs obtained and reviewed on C1D1 before 
randomization may also be used as the screening value to determine el igibility.
Thyroid function testing will be performed within 3 days of each subsequent cycle. 
Participants may be dosed while thyroid function test results are pending, however the results 
must be reviewed by the investigator when available.
8.3.5.2 Pregnancy Test ing
All women who are being considered for participation in the study, and who are not 
surgically sterilized or postmenopausal, must be tested for pregnancy within 24hours o f the 
first dose of study intervention . If a urine test is positive or not evaluable, a serum test will be 
required. Participants must be excluded/discontinued from the study in the event of a positive 
test result. Repeated pregnancy test (such as monthly testing) may be conducted if required 
by local regulation.
•Pregnancy testin g:
-Pregnancy testing requirements for study inclusion are described in Section 5.1 .
-Pregnancy testing (urine or serum) should be conducted at every protocol treatment 
cycle ,as per SoA.
-Pregnancy testing (urine or serum) should be conducted for the time r equired to 
eliminate systemic exposure after the last dose of each study intervention and should 
correspond with the time frame for the participant’s contraception, as noted in Section
5.1. The length of time required to continue pregnancy testing for each study 
intervention is:
◦120 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab
◦30 days after the last dose of lenvatinib/placebo
-Additional serum or urine pregnancy tests may be performed, as determined 
necessary by the investigator or required by local regulation , to establish the absence 
of pregnancy at any time during the participant’s participation in the study.

8.3.6 Performance Assessments
8.3.6.1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status
The ECOG Performance Status is standardized criteria to measure how cancer impacts level 
of functioning (performance status) in terms of ability to care for oneself, daily activity, and 
physical ability (walking, working, etc) with grades 0 to 5.
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (see Appendix 9) at 
screening, before the administration of each dose of study intervention and during the 
follow -up period as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).
8.4 Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Other Reportable Safety Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and 
assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting AE, 
SAE, and other reportable safety event reports can be found in Appendix 3 .
Progression of the cancer under study i s not considered an AE as described in Section 8.4.6
and Appendix 3.
Adverse events, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by the participant 
(or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant ’s legally authorized 
representative).
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events. 
Investigators need to document if an SAE was associated wit h a medication error, misuse, or 
abuse.
Investigators remain responsible for following up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety 
events for outcome according to Section 8.4.3 . The investigator, who is a qualified physician, 
will assess events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as o ther reportable safety 
events with respect to seriousness, intensity/toxicity ,and causality.
Adverse events will not be collected for participants during the prescreening period (for 
determination of archival tissue status) as long as that participant has not undergone any 
protocol -specified procedure or intervention. If the participant requires a blood draw, fresh 
tumor biopsy, etc, the participant is first required to provide consent to the main study, and 
AEs will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.
8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, SAE, and Other Reportable 
Safety Event Information
All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the participant provides 
documented informed consent, but before intervention allocation/randomization , must be 
reported by the investigator if the participant is receiving placebo run -in or other run -in 
treatment, if the event cause the participant to be excluded from the study, or is the result of a

protoco l-specified intervention, including, but not limited to washout or discontinuation of 
usual therapy, diet, or a procedure.
•All AEs from the time of intervention randomization through 30 days following cessation 
of study intervention must be reported by the investigator.
•All AEs meeting serious criteria, from the time of intervention allocation /randomization
through 90 days following cessation of study intervention or 30 days following cessation 
of study intervention if the participant initiates new anticanc er therapy, whichever is 
earlier, must be reported by the investigator.
•All pregnancies and exposure during breastfeeding, from the time of treatment 
allocation /randomization through 120 days following pembrolizumab or 30 days 
following cessation of lenvat inib/placebo, whichever occurs last, must be reported by the 
investigator. If the participant initiates new anticancer therapy following discontinuation 
of study intervention, the time period for reporting pregnancies and exposure during 
breastfeeding is r educed to 30 days following cessation of study intervention.
•Additionally, any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator at any time outside of 
the time period specified above must be reported immediately to the Sponsor if the event 
is considered rel ated to study intervention.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs or other reportable safety events 
in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the investigator 
considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, 
the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.
All initial and follow -up AEs, SAEs, and other reportabl e safety events will be recorded and 
reported to the Spons or or designee within the time frames as indicated in Table 8.
Exception: A positive pregnancy test at the time of initial screening is not a reportable event 
unless the participant has received study intervention.

8.4.2 Method of Detecting AEs, SAEs, and Other Reportable Safety Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs and o ther 
reportable safety events . Open -ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is 
the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence.

MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
8.4.3 Follow -up of AE, SAE, and Other Reportable Safety Event Information
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. SAEs and other reportable safety events, including 
pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, ECIs, cancer, and overdose w ill be followed 
until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost 
to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). The investigator will also make every attempt to 
follow nonserious AEs that occur in randomized participants for outcome. Further 
information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3.
8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE
Prompt notification (within 24 hours ) by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAE is essential 
so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the 
safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulator y agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements and global laws and 
regulations relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs, and in vestigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory 
requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE s) from the Sponsor will file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding
Although pregnancy a nd infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, any 
pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding (spontaneously reported to the 
investigator or their designee) that occurs in a participant during the study are reportable to 
the Sponsor .
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy.
Any pregnancy complication will be reported as an AE or SAE.
The medical reason (example: maternal health or fetal disease) for an elective termination of 
a pregnan cy will be reported as an AE or SAE. Prenatal testing showing fetus will be born 
with severe abnormalities/congenital anomalies that leads to an elective termination of a 
pregnancy will be reported as an SAE for the fetus.
Pregnancy outcomes of ectopic pre gnancy, spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign 
hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth 
must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to 
term, the outc ome (health of infant) must also be reported.

8.4.6 Disease -related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
AEs or SAEs
Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be reported to the Sponsor as described 
inSection 8.4.
Specifically, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is 
disease progression of the cancer under study.
The Sponsor will ensure that unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data 
are monitored to safeguard the participants in the study.
8.4.7 Events of Clinical Interest
Selected serious and nonserious AEs are also known as ECIs and must be reported to the 
Sponsor.
Events of clinical interest for this study include:
1.An overdose of Sponsor's product, as defined in Secti on 8.5, that is not associated with 
clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results. 
Lenvatinib overdose without an associated adverse event is not considered an ECI.
2.Potential DILI events defined as an elevated AST or ALT laboratory value that is great er 
than or equal to 3 ×the ULN and an elevated total bilirubin laboratory value that is greater 
than or equal to 2×the ULN and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase laboratory 
value that is less than 2 ×the ULN, as determined by way of protocol -speci fied laboratory 
testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*
*Note: These criteria are based on available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose 
of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an 
additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The study -site guidance for assessment 
and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).
8.5 Treatment of Overdose
For purposes of this study, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed 
dose for:
•Pembrolizumab: ≥5 times the protocol -specified dose.
•Lenvatinib: any dose above the protocol -prescribed dose if associated with an adverse 
event
There is no specific antidote for an overdose of lenvatinib. D ue to its high degree of plasma 
protein binding, lenvatinib is not expected to be dialyzable. Adverse reactions in patients

at the recommended dose for differen tiated thyroid cancer, RCC, and HCC.
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab or 
lenvatinib.
All reports of pembrolizumab overdose with and without an AE and all reports of lenvatinib 
overdose with an AE must be re ported by the investigator within 24 hours to the Sponsor 
either by electronic media or paper.
Reports of pembrolizumab overdose without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal 
laboratory results, should be reported using the terminology “accidental o r intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.”
8.6 Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetic parameters will not be evaluated in this study.
8.7 Pharmacodynamics
Pharmacodynamic parameters will not be evaluated in this study.
8.8 Biomarkers

Course treatment with pembrolizumab. Visit requirements for the Second Cou rse Treatment 
Phase are outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3.2). Specific procedure -related details are provided 
in Section 8.1.
8.11.4 Participants Discontinued From Study Intervention but Continuing to be 
Monitored in the Study
The End -of-Treatment visit will take place at the time study intervention is discontinued for 
any reason. 
If the End -of-Treatment visit takes place approximately 30 days from the last dose of study 
intervention, a separate Safety Follow -up visit is not required. All procedures required at th e 
End-of-Treatment visit and at the Safety Follow -up visit will be performed as a single visit.
8.11.5 Posttreatment Visit
8.11.5.1 Safety Follow -up Visit
The mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit should be conducted approximately 30 days after the 
last dose of study intervent ion or before initiation of a new anticancer treatment, whichever 
comes first.
Participants who are eligible for retreatment with pembrolizumab may have up to 2 safety 
follow -up visits: 1 after the Initial Treatment or First Course and 1 after the Second Course.
8.11.5.2 Efficacy Follow -up Visits
As of Amendment 05: Efficacy Follow -up Visits will be discontinued except for participants 
who are candidates for Second Course treatment and participants in China .Imaging scans 
will no longer be submitted to the iCRO nor read by BICR. Participants who are eligible to 
receive retreatment with pembrolizumab according to the criteria in Section 6.7 will move 
from Efficacy Follow -up to Second Course when they experience investigator -assessed
disease progression .  Original protocol text that is contained in this section has been retained 
for reference. (Note: participants in China will continue to have BICR tumor res ponse 
assessments and will continue to submit scans to the iCRO. Participants in China who are 
eligible to receive retreatment with pembrolizumab according to the criteria in Section 6.7 
will move from Efficacy Follow -up to Second Course when they experien ce 
centrally -verified disease progression .)
Participants who complete the protocol -required cycles of study intervention or who 
discontinue study intervention for a reason other than centrally -verified radiographic disease 
progression will move into Effic acy Follow -up and will be assessed as outlined in the SoA

regarding disease status until centrally -verified disease progression, the start of new 
anticancer therapy , death, or the end of the study , whichever occurs first . Information 
regarding poststudy anticancer treatment will be collected if new treatment is initiated. 
Participants who completed all efficacy assessments and/or will not have further efficacy 
assess ments must enter Survival Follow -up.
Participants who are eligible to receive retreatment with pembrolizumab according to the 
criteria in Section 6.7 will move from Efficacy Follow -up to Second Course when they 
experience centrally -verified disease progres sion. Second Course study procedure 
requirements are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3.2) .
8.11.5.3 Survival Follow -up Contacts
As of Amendment 05: Survival Follow -up Visits will be discontinued except for participants 
in China. Those participants remaining on study treatment at the time of Amendment 0 5
should continue to be monitored in the study through the AE reporting period (Section 8.4). 
Original protocol text that is contained in this section has been retained for reference.
Participant survival follow -upstatus will be assessed approximately every 12 weeks to assess 
for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever 
occurs first.
The first survival follow -up assessment should be scheduled as described below:
•For par ticipants who discontinue treatment intervention and who will not enter Efficacy 
Follow -up, the first survival follow -up contact will be scheduled 12 weeks after the 
Discontinuation Visit and/or Safety Follow -up Visit (whichever is last).
•For participants who completed assessments in Efficacy Follow -up, the first survival 
follow -up contact will be scheduled 12 weeks after the last efficacy assessment follow -up 
visit has been performed.
8.11.6 Vital Status
To ensure current and complete survival information (vital status) is available at the time of 
database locks, updated vital status may be requested during the study by the Sponsor. For 
example, updated vital status may be requested before but not limited to, an eDMC review,

9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN
As of Amen dment 05: The Statistic al Analysis Plan is amended as follows.
NOTE: Based on the data from an interim safety and efficacy analysis for LEAP -010(data
cutoff 30-May-2023), the study will be discontinued due to lack of efficacy because 
pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib did not demonstrate an improvement in OS, 
one of the trial ’s primary endpoints, compared to pembrolizumab plus placebo and appears 
unlikely to do so in a future analysis. Based upon these data and the recommendation of the 
eDMC, the study was unblinded on16-Aug-2023. The prespecified interim analysis 3 ( IA3)
and final analysis of the study described in the SAP will not be performed. Safety analysis 
will be performed at the end of the study; there will be no further planned analyses for
efficacy and ePRO endpoints.
This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. The study 
has been unblinded as of 16-Aug-2023. Changes made to primary and/or key secondary 
hypotheses, or the statistical methods related to those hypotheses that occurred prior to 
Amendment 05 were documented in previous protocol amend ments(s) (consistent with 
International Conference on Harmoni sation [ ICH]Guideline E -9). Changes to exploratory or 
other nonconfirmatory analyses made after the protocol has been finalized, but before the 
conduct of any analysis, will be documented in an sSAP and referenced in the CSR for the 
study. The PRO analysi s plan will also be included in the sSAP.
Details pertaining to the statistical analyses for participants enrolled in China will be 
provided in a separate sSAP.
9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary
Key elements of the SAP are summarized below. The comprehensi ve plan is provided in 
Section 9.2 –Responsibility for Analyses/In -House Blinding through Section 9.12 –Extent 
of Exposure. As of Amendment 0 5, the prespecified IA3 and final analysis of the study
described in the SAP will not be performed. Safety analys is will be performed at the end of
the study; there will be no further planned analyses of efficacy and ePRO endpoints. The 
SAP summary has been updated accordingly.

Study Design 
OverviewA Phase 3 study of pembrolizumab (MK -3475) with or without 
lenvatinib (E7 080/MK -7902) as 1L intervention in a PD -L1 
selected population with R/M HNSCC (LEAP -010)
Treatment 
AssignmentApproximately 500 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 
ratio treatment groups: (1) the pembrolizumab + lenvatinib arm 
and (2) t he pembrolizumab + placebo arm. Stratification factors 
are: 
•PD-L1 tumor expression as determined by PD -L1 
immunohistochemistry (TPS <50% vs. ≥50%)
•HPV status for oropharynx cancer as determined by p16 
immunohistochemistry (positive vs. negative); HPV status 
for participants without oropharynx cancer (eg, cancers of 
the oral cavity, hypopharynx and larynx) is considered HPV 
negative.
•ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1)
This is a randomized double -blind study.
Analysis Populations Efficacy: Intent -to-Treat
Safety: All -Participants -as-Treated
Primary Endpoints ORR, PFS, OS
Statistical Methods for 
Key Efficacy AnalysesThe primary hypotheses addressing PFS and OS will be 
evaluated by comparing the experimental group to the control 
group using a stratified log -rank test. The hazard ratio will be 
estimated using a stratified Cox regression model. Event rates 
over time will be estimated within each treatment group using 
the Kaplan -Meier method. The stratified Miettinen and 
Nurminen method [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] with 
strata weighted by sample size will be used for th e analysis of 
the primary hypothesis addressing ORR. 
Statistical Methods for 
Key Safety AnalysesFor analyses in which 95% CIs will be provided for between -

Interim Analyses As of Amendment 0 5, the prespecified IA3and final analysis of 
the study described in the SAP will not be performed.
Efficacy
Three interim analyses are planned in this study. Results will be 
reviewed by an external DMC. Details are provided in Section 
9.7.
•Interim Analysis 1 (IA1):
-Timing: to be performed after 350 participants are 
randomized with 6 months o f follow -up
-Primary purpose: efficacy analysis for ORR and PFS
•Interim Analysis 2 (IA2): 
-Timing: to be performed after both ~432 PFS events 
have been observed and ~ 6months after last participant 
randomized
-Primary purpose: efficacy analysis for PFS and OS
•Interim Analysis 3 (IA3): 
-Timing: to be performed after both ~326 OS events have 
occurred and ~ 14 months after last participant 
randomized
-Primary purpose: efficacy analysis for OS
•Final Analysis (FA): 
-Timing: to be performed after both ~361 OS event s have 
occurred and ~ 20 months after last participant 
randomized
-Primary purpose: efficacy analysis for OS
Note that for IA2, IA3 and the FA, if the events accrue more 
slowly than expected, the analysis can be delayed up to 3 
months after the projected ti ming.
Safety :
The first safety interim analysis will be performed and reviewed 
by the eDMC at 6 months after the first participant is 
randomized, or when the first 60 participants have been 
randomized, whichever is later. Afterwards, the eDMC will 
review s afety data periodically in the study. Details will be 
included in the DMC charter.
Multiplicity The overall Type I error over the primary hypotheses is strongly 
controlled at 2.5% (1 -sided), with 0.25% initially allocated to 
ORR (H1), 0.1% to PFS (H2), and 2.15% to OS (H3).
By using the graphical approach of Mau rer and Bretz [Maurer, 
W. and Bretz, F. 2013] , if one hypothesis is rejected, the alpha 
will be shifted to other hypotheses as described in Secti on 9.8.

Sample Size and 
PowerAs of Amendment 0 5, the IA3 and final analysis of the study 
described in the SAP will not be performed.
The planned sample size is approximately 500 participants. 
There will be 350 participants randomized with at least 
6months of follow -up at the ORR final analysis. The study has 
90.4% power for detecting a 20 -percentage point difference 
between treatment arms with an underlying 20% response rate 
in the control arm at an initially assigned 0.0025 (1 -sided) 
significance leve l.
It is estimated that there will be ~ 432 events at the PFS final 
analysis (ie , IA2 of the study). With 432 PFS events, the study 
has >99.9% power for detecting a hazard ratio of 0.5 at an 
initially assigned 0.001 (1 -sided) significance level. 
There wil l be ~ 361 deaths at the OS final analysis. With 
361deaths, the study has ~90.7% power for detecting a hazard 
ratio of 0.7 at an initially assigned 0.0215 (1 -sided) significance 
level. 
9.2 Responsibility for Analyses/In -house Blinding 
The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the responsibility of the 
Clinical Biostatistics department of the Sponsor.
After efficacy IA2, the study was unblinded on 16 -Aug-2023.
This study will be conducted as a double -blinded study under in -house blinding procedures. 
The official, final database will not be unblinded until medical/scientific review has been 
performed, protocol deviations have been identified, and data have been declared final and 
complete.
The Sp onsor will generate the randomized allocation schedule for study treatment 
assignment for this protocol and the randomization will be implemented in IVRS/IWRS.
The investigator and the study team at the Sponsor consisting of clinical, statistical, statisti cal 
programming and data management personnel will be blinded to participant -level PD -L1 
biomarker score. An unblinded Sponsor statistician and unblinded Sponsor statistical 
programmer will have access to the participant -level PD -L1 results for the purpose of data 
review and will have no other responsibilities associated with the study. A summary of PD 
L1 biomarker prevalence may be provided to the study team at the Sponsor by the unblinded 
Sponsor statistician. In addition, the independent radiologist(s) w ill perform the central 
imaging review without knowledge of treatment group assignment.  
Blinding issues related to the planned interim analyses are described in Section 9.7.

Objectives and hypotheses of the study are stated in Sec tion 3.0 –Hypotheses, Objectives 
and Endpoints.
9.4 Analysis Endpoints
Efficacy and safety endpoints that will be evaluated are listed below.
9.4.1 Efficacy Endpoints
Primary
•Objective Response Rate
The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a confirmed complete 
response or partial response per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR.
•Progression -free Survival
PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression 
per RECIST 1.1 by BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. See Section 
9.6.1 –Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses for definition of censoring.
•Overall Survival
OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.
Secondary
•Duration of Response
For particip ants who show confirmed CR or PR, duration of response is defined as the time 
from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any 
cause, whichever occurs first.
9.4.2 Safety Endpoints
Safety measurements are described in Section 4.2.1.2 –Safety Endpoints and Section 8 –
Study Assessments and Procedures. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical 
review of all relevant parameters including AEs, laboratory tests and vital signs. Safety 
parameters to be analyzed in clude, but are not limited to, AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, and 
laboratory changes.

9.4.3 Patient -Reported Outcome Endpoints
Changes from baseline in the global health status/quality of life and physical functioning 
scores of the EORTC QLQ -C30 will be evaluated as over all measures of HRQoL. Additional 
details of the PRO endpoints, including analyses of the remaining functioning and symptom 
scores of the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ -H&N35 and health status scores of the 
EQ-5D-5L, will be described in the sSAP.
9.5 Analysis Po pulations
9.5.1 Efficacy Analysis Populations
The ITT population will serve as the population for the primary efficacy analyses. For the 
analyses of ORR, approximately the first 350 or more randomized participants will be 
included in the analysis population. For the analyses of PFS and OS, all randomized 
participants will be included in the ITT population. For the analyses of DOR, the subset of 
participants who show a confirmed complete response or partial response will be included in 
the analysis population. Par ticipants will be included in the treatment group to which they are 
randomized.
9.5.2 Safety Analysis Populations
Safety analyses will be conducted in the APaT population, which consists of all randomized 
participants who received at least one dose of study trea tment. Participants will be included 
in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment they actually received for the 
analysis of safety data using the APaT population. This will be the treatment group to which 
they are randomized except for part icipants who take incorrect study treatment for the entire 
treatment period; such participants will be included in the treatment group corresponding to 
the study treatment actually received.
At least 1 laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained after at least 1 dose of study 
treatment is required for inclusion in the analysis of each specific parameter. To assess 
change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required.
9.5.3 Patient -Reported Outcome Analysis Populations
The PRO analyses are based on the PRO FAS population, defined as participants who have at 
least 1 PRO assessment available for the specific endpoint and have received at least 1 dose 
of the study intervention.
9.5.4 Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set
No pharmacokinetic endpoints are planned for this study.

9.6 Statistical Methods
9.6.1 Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses
NOTE: As of Amendment 0 5, the prespecified IA3 and final analysis of the study described 
in the SAP will not be performed. Safety analysis will be performed at the end of the study; 
there will be no further planned analyses of efficacy and ePRO endpoints. Original protocol 
text that is contained in this section has been retained for reference.
This section describes the statistical methods that address the primary and secondary
objectives. Methods related to exploratory objectives will be described in the supplemental 
SAP.
Efficacy results that will be deemed to be statistically significant after consideration of the 
Type I error control strategy are described in Section 9.8, Mu ltiplicity. Nominal p -values 
may be computed for other efficacy analyses but should be interpreted with caution due to 
potential issues of multiplicity and sample size.
The stratification factors used for randomization (see Section 6.3.2 -Stratification) will be 
applied to all stratified analyses, in particular, the stratified log -rank test, stratified Cox 
model, and stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 
1985] . If there are sma ll strata, for the purpose of analysis, strata will be combined to ensure 
sufficient number of participants, responses or events in each stratum. Details regarding the 
pooling strategy will be prespecified in the sSAP before the database lock for the first
efficacy interim analysis, and decisions regarding the pooling will be based on a blinded 
review of response and event counts by stratum.
9.6.1.1 Objective Response Rate
The stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method [Miett inen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] will 
be used for comparison of the ORR between two treatment groups. The difference in ORR 
and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method with 
strata weighting by sample size will be rep orted. The stratification factors used for 
randomization (See Section 6.3.2 -Stratification) will be applied to the analysis. The point 
estimate of ORR will be provided by treatment group, together with 95% CI using exact 
binomial method proposed by Clopp er and Pearson (1934) [Clopper, C. J. and Pearson, E. S. 
1934] . Supportive analyses may be performed for comparison of ORR based on 
investigator’s assessment.
9.6.1.2 Progression -free Survival
The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS curve in each 
treatment group. The treatment difference in PFS will be assessed by the stratified log -rank 
test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie handling will be 
used to ass ess the magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, hazard ratio) between the 
treatment arms. The hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval from the stratified Cox 
model with Efron’s method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate will be 
reported. The stratification factors used for randomization (See Section 6.3.2 -Stratification)

will be applied to both the stratified log -rank test and the stratified Cox model. Supportive 
analyses may be performed for comparison of PFS based on investigat or’s assessment.
Since disease progression is assessed periodically, PD can occur any time in the time interval 
between the last assessment where PD was not documented and the assessment when PD is 
documented. The true date of disease progression will be a pproximated by the earlier of the 
date of the first assessment at which PD is objectively documented per RECIST 1.1 by BICR 
and the date of death. Death is considered a PD event.
For the primary analysis, any participant who experiences an event (PD or dea th) 
immediately after 2 or more missed disease assessments will be censored at the last disease 
assessment before the missed visits. In addition, any participant who initiates new anticancer 
therapy will be censored at the last disease assessment before th e initiation of new anticancer 
therapy. Participants who do not start new anticancer therapy and who do not experience an 
event will be censored at the last disease assessment. If a participant meets multiple criteria 
for censoring, the censoring criterion that occurs earliest will be applied.  
To evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint per RECIST 1.1 by BICR, 2 sensitivity 
analyses with different sets of censoring rules will be performed. The first sensitivity analysis 
follows the intention -to-treat p rinciple. That is, PDs/deaths are counted as events regardless 
of missed study visits or initiation of new anticancer therapy. The second sensitivity analysis 
considers discontinuation of treatment due to reasons other than complete response or 
initiation of new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs later, to be a PD event for 
participants without documented PD or death. If a participant meets multiple criteria for 
censoring, the censoring criterion that occurs earliest will be applied. The censoring rules for 
the primary and sensitivity analyses are summarized in Table 9.

9.6.1.3 Overall Survival
The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the survival curves. The 
treatment difference in survival will be assessed by the stratified log -rank test. A stratified 
Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie handling will be used to assess the 
magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, the hazard ratio). The hazard ratio and its 95% 
confidence interval from the stratified Cox model with a single treatment co variate will be 
reported. The stratification factors used for randomization (See Section 6.3.2 -Stratification) 
will be applied to both the stratified log -rank test and the stratified Cox model. Participants 
without documented death at the time of analysi s will be censored at the date the participant 
was last known to be alive.
9.6.1.4 Duration of Response
If sample size permits, DOR will be summarized descriptively using Kaplan -Meier medians 
and quartiles. Only the subset of participants who show a confirmed comp lete response or 
partial response will be included in this analysis. 
Censoring rules for DOR are summarized in Table 10.

For each DOR analysis, a corresponding summary of the reasons responding participants are 
censored will also be provided. Responding participants who are alive, have not progressed, 
have no t initiated new anticancer treatment, have not been determined to be lost to follow -up, 
and have had a disease assessment within ~5 months of the data cutoff date are considered 
ongoing responders at the time of analysis. If a participant meets multiple cr iteria for 
censoring, the censoring criterion that occurs earliest will be applied.

The strategy to address multiplicity issues with regard to multiple endpoints and interim 
analyses is described in Section 9.7 (Interim Analyses) and Section 9.8 (Multiplicity).
9.6.2 Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including 
AEs, laboratory tests and vital signs.
The analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach ( Table 12). The tiers differ with 
respect to the analyses that will be performed. Adverse events (specific terms as well as 
system organ class terms) and events that meet predefined limits of change in laboratory and 
vital si gns parameters are either prespecified as “Tier 1” endpoints or will be classified as 
belonging to “Tier 2” or “Tier 3” based on the observed proportions of participants with an 
event.
Tier 1 Events
Safety parameters or adverse events of special interest t hat are identified a priori constitute 
“Tier 1” safety endpoints that will be participant to inferential testing for statistical 
significance. AEs that are immune -mediated or potentially immune -mediated are well 
documented and will be evaluated separately; however, these events have been characterized 
consistently throughout the pembrolizumab clinical development program, and determination 
of statistical significance is not expected to add value to the safety evaluation. Finally, there 
are no known AEs asso ciated with participants with HNSCC for which determination of a p -
value is expected to impact the safety assessment. Thus, there are no AEs that warrant 
elevation to Tier 1 in this study.   
Tier 2 Events
Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estim ates with 95% CIs provided for differences 
in the proportion of participants with events using the Miettinen and Nurminen method, an 
unconditional, asymptotic method [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] .
Member ship in Tier 2 requires that at least 10% of participants in any treatment group show 
the event; all other AEs will belong to Tier 3. The threshold of at least 10% of participants 
was chosen for Tier 2 events because the population enrolled in this study i s in critical 
condition and usually experiences various AEs of similar types regardless of treatment; 
events reported less frequently than 10% of participants would obscure the assessment of the 
overall safety profile and add little to the interpretation o f potentially meaningful treatment 
differences. In addition, Grade 3 to 5 AEs ( ≥5% of participants in 1 of the treatment groups), 
SAEs (5% of participants in 1 of the treatment groups) and tumor hemorrhage (incidence ≥4 
of participants in one of the treatm ent groups) will be considered Tier 2 endpoints. Because 
many 95% CIs may be provided without adjustment for multiplicity, the CIs should be 
regarded as a helpful descriptive measure to be used in safety review, not as a formal method 
for assessing the sta tistical significance of the between -group differences.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
Tier 3 Events
Safety endpoints that are not Tier 1 or 2 events are considered Tier 3 events. The broad AE 
categories consisting of the proportion of participants with any AE, any drug -related AE, an y 
Grade 3 to 5 AE, any serious AE, any AE which is both drug -related and Grade 3 to 5, any 
AE which is both serious and drug -related, discontinued due to an AE, and death that are not 
prespecified as Tier 1 endpoints will be classified as belong to “Tier 3 ”. Laboratory test 
toxicity grade shift from baseline will be considered Tier 3 event. Only point estimates by 
treatment group are provided for Tier 3 safety parameters.
Continuous Safety Measures 
Continuous measures such as changes from baseline in vital signs parameters will be 
considered Tier 3 event. Summary statistics for baseline, on -treatment, and change from 
baseline values will be provided by treatment group for vital signs parameters.

9.6.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
The comparability of the treatmen t groups for each relevant demographic and baseline 
characteristic will be assessed by the use of tables and/or graphs. No statistical hypothesis 
tests will be performed on these characteristics. The number and percentage of participants 
screened and rando mized and the primary reasons for screening failure and discontinuation 
will be displayed. Demographic variables, baseline characteristics, primary and secondary 
diagnoses, and prior and concomitant therapies will be summarized by treatment either by 
descr iptive statistics or categorical tables.
9.7 Interim Analyses
NOTE: As of Amendment 0 5, the prespecified IA3 and final analysis of the study described 
in the SAP will not be performed. This section is retained for reference.
Access to the allocation schedule for summaries or analyses for presentation to the eDMC 
will be restricted to an unblinded statistician and an unblinded scientific programmer 
performing the interim analysis, who will have no other responsibilities associa ted with the 
study.  
The eDMC will serve as the primary reviewer of the results of the interim analyses and will 
make recommendations for discontinuation of the study or modification to the executive 
oversight committee of the Sponsor. If the eDMC recomme nds modifications to the design of 
the protocol or discontinuation of the study, this executive oversight committee and 
potentially other limited Sponsor personnel may be unblinded to results at the treatment level 
to act on these recommendations. The exte nt to which individuals are unblinded with respect 
to results of interim analyses will be documented by the unblinded team. Additional logistic 
details will be provided in the eDMC Charter.  
Treatment -level results of the interim analysis will be provided by the unblinded statistician 
to the eDMC. Before final study unblinding, the unblinded statistician will not be involved in 
any discussions regarding modifications to the protocol or statistical methods, identification 
of protocol deviations, or data val idation efforts after the interim analyses.
9.7.1 Efficacy Interim Analyses
Three interim analyses are planned in addition to the final analysis for this study. Interim 
Analysis 1 will include at least 350 participants with 6 months of follow -up, and the other 
interim analyses and final analysis will include all randomized participants. Results of the 
interim analyses will be reviewed by the DMC. Details of the boundaries for establishing 
statistical significance with regards to efficacy are discussed further in Section 9.8.
The analyses planned, endpoints evaluated, and drivers of timing are summarized in 
Table 13.

17 months and 23 months, respectively.
9.7.2 Safety Interim Analy sis
The eDMC wasresponsible for periodic interim safety reviews as specified in the DMC 
charter. Details wereincluded in the DMC charter. Safety monitoring will continue as per 
protocol. 
9.8 Multiplicity
NOTE: As of Amendment 0 5, the prespecified IA3 and final analysis of the study described 
in the SAP will not be performed. Original protocol text that is contained in this section has 
been retained for reference.
The study uses the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz [Maurer, W. and Bretz, F. 2013] to 
control multiplicity for multiple hypotheses as well as interim analyses. According to this 
approach, study hypotheses may be tested more than once, and when a particular null 
hypothesis is rej ected, the α allocated to that hypothesis can be reallocated to other 
hypothesis tests. Figure 6shows the initial 1 -sided α allocation for each hypothesis in the 
ellipse representing the hypothesis. The weights for re -allocation from each hypothesis to the 
others are shown in the boxes on the lines connecting hypotheses.
The overall Type -I error is strongly controlled at 0.025 (1 -sided) for the 3 primary endpoints 
ORR , PFS and OS. The initial α assigned to ORR, PFS, and OS will be 0.0025, 0.001 and 
0.0215, respectively. If the PFS hypothesis is rejected, the corresponding alpha can be 
reallocated to OS. If the OS hypothesis is rejected, the corresponding alpha can be 
reallocated to PFS. If ORR hypothesis is rejected, the corresponding alpha can be reallocated

to PFS. If both the OS and PFS hypotheses are rejected, the corresponding alpha can be 
reallocated to ORR.

Abbreviations: ORR = objective response rate; OS = overall survival; PFS = progression -free survival.
9.8.1 Objective Response Rate
The study will test ORR only once at IA1, at an initial α level of 0.0025 ( Figure 6). Note that 
if superiority for both the PFS and OS hypotheses is declared at a future planned analysis, 
α=0.0225 will be rolled over to the hypothesis for OR R, then the test statistics previously 
computed at IA1 for the ORR hypothesis will be used for inferential testing with an updated 
alpha level of 0.025.
Based on the first 350 randomized participants with at least 6 months of follow -up, power at 
the possib le α-levels as well as the approximate treatment difference required to reach the 
bound (ΔORR) are shown in Table 14, assuming underlying 20% and 40% response rates i n 
the control and experimental groups, respectively.

Abbreviation: ORR = objective response rate.
9.8.2 Progression -free Survival
The study will test PFS at IA1 and IA2 only. After the multiplicity strategy as outline in 
Figure 6, the PFS hypothesis may be tested at α=0.001 (initially allocated α ), at α=0.0035 (if 
the ORR null hypothesis is rejected but not the OS hypothesis), at α=0.0225 (if the OS null 
hypothesis is rejected but not the ORR hypothesis), or at α=0.025 (if both the OS and ORR 
null hypotheses are rejected). For the superiority hypo thesis, a Lan -DeMets O’Brien -Fleming 
alpha spending function is used to construct group sequential boundaries to control the Type -
I error rate. Table 15shows the bou ndary properties for each of these α levels for the PFS 
analysis. Note that the final row indicates the total power to reject the null hypothesis for PFS 
at each α level. Also, note that if the OS null hypothesis is rejected at IA3 or FA of the study, 
the previously computed PFS test statistics may be used for inferential testing with its 
updated bounds, considering the α reallocation from the OS hypothesis.
For the PFS hypothesis H2, IA2 will be the final PFS analysis with a target number of events 
of 432. The bounds provided in Table 15are based on the assumption that the number of 
events at IA1 and IA2 are 350 and 432, respectively. At the time of an analysis, the o bserved 
number of events may differ substantially from the expected. To avoid overspending at IA1 
and keep reasonable alpha for the IA2, the minimum alpha spending strategy will be adopted. 
At IA1, the information fraction used in Lan -DeMets spending funct ion to determine the 
alpha spending at the IA will be based on the minimum of the expected information fraction 
and the actual information fraction at the analysis.
•In the scenario that the event accumulation is faster than expected, ie, if the number of 
observed events exceeds the expected number of events at IA1, then the information 
fraction will be calculated as the expected number of events at IA1 over the target 
number of events at IA2. 
•In the scenario that the event accumulation is slower than expec ted and number of events 
is less than the expected number of events in the table when IA1 is conducted, the 
information fraction will be calculated as the actual number of events at IA1 over the 
target number of events at IA2. 
The final PFS analysis will use the remaining Type I error that was not spent at the earlier 
analysis. The p -value bound at the final PFS analysis will be calculated by considering the 
correlation between the test statistics as determined by the actual num ber of PFS events at 
IA1 and IA2 of the study.

9.8.3 Overall Survival
The study will test OS at IA2, IA3 and FA. After the multiplicity strategy as outlined in 
Figure 6the OS hypothesis may be tested at α=0.0215 (initially allocated α) , or α=0.0225 (if 
the PFS null hypothesis is rejected but not the ORR hypothesis), or α=0.025 (if both the PFS 
and ORR null hypotheses are rejected). For the superiority hypothesis, a Lan -DeMets 
O’Brien -Fleming alpha spending function is used to construct group sequential boundaries to 
control the Type I error rate. Table 16shows the boundary properties for each of these α 
levels for the OS analysis. The bounds provid ed in the table are based on the assumption that 
the number of events at IA2, IA3 and FA are 258, 326 and 361, respectively. At the time of 
an analysis, the observed number of events may differ substantially from the expected. To 
avoid overspending at an i nterim analysis and keep reasonable alpha for the final analysis, 
the minimum alpha spending strategy will be adopted. At an IA, the information fraction 
used in Lan -DeMets spending function to determine the alpha spending at the IA will be 
based on the mi nimum of the expected information fraction and the actual information 
fraction at each analysis.
•In the scenario that the event accumulation is faster than expected, ie, if the number of 
observed events exceeds the expected number of events at an interim a nalysis, then the 
information fraction will be calculated as the expected number of events at the interim 
analysis over the target number of events at FA. 
•In the scenario that the event accumulation is slower than expected and number of events 
is less tha n the expected number of events in the table when an interim analysis is 
conducted, the information fraction will be calculated as the actual number of events at 
the interim analysis over the target number of events at FA.

The final OS analysis will use the remaining Type I error that has not been spent at the earlier 
analyses. The event counts for all analyses will be used to compute correlations.
Of note, while the information fraction used for alpha spending calculation will be the 
minimum of the actua l information fraction and the expected information fraction, the 
correlations required for deriving the bounds will still be computed using the actual 
information fraction based on the observed number of events at each analysis over the target

b HR at bound is the approximate HR required to reach an efficacy bound.
c P(Cross if HR=1) is the probability of crossing a bound under the null hypothesis.
d P(Cross if HR=0.7) is the probability of crossing a bound under the alternative hypothesis.
The minimum spending approach assumes timing is not based on any observed Z -value and 
thus the Z test statistics used for testing conditioned on timing are multivariate normal. Given 
the probabilities derived with the proposed spending method, the correlations based on actual 
event counts are used to comput e bounds that control the Type I error at the specified alpha 
level for a given hypothesis conditioned on the interim analysis timing. Since this is true 
regardless of what is conditioned on, the overall Type I error for a given hypothesis 
unconditionally is controlled at the specified level. By using more conservative spending 
early in the study, power can be retained to detect situations where the treatment effect may 
be delayed.
9.8.4 Safety Analyses
The DMC has responsibility for assessment of overall risk/be nefit. When prompted by safety 
concerns, the DMC can request corresponding efficacy data. DMC review of efficacy data to 
assess the overall risk/benefit to study participants will not require a multiplicity adjustment 
08K59L

typically associated with a planned ef ficacy interim analysis. However, to account for any 
multiplicity concerns raised by the DMC review of unplanned efficacy data prompted by 
safety concerns, a sensitivity analysis for ORR, PFS and OS adopting a conservative 
multiplicity adjustment will be p respecified in the sSAP.
9.9 Sample Size and Power Calculations
NOTE: As of Amendment 0 5, the prespecified IA3 and final analysis of the study described 
in the SAP will not be performed. This section is retained for reference.
The study will randomize 500 part icipants in a 1:1 ratio into the pembrolizumab + lenvatinib 
arm and pembrolizumab + placebo arm. ORR, PFS and OS are primary endpoints for the 
study.
Based on the 350 participants with at least 6 months of follow -up, the power of the ORR 
testing at the ini tially allocated α=0.0025 (1 -sided) is approximately 90.4% to detect a 20 -
percentage point difference between an underlying 20% response rate in the control arm and 
a 40% response rate in the experimental arm.
For the PFS endpoint, based on a target number of 432 events at the final analysis and 1 
interim analysis at approximately 81% of the target number of events, the study has 
approximately >99.9% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.5 at the initially allocated α=0.001 
(1-sided). 
For the OS endpoint, ba sed on a target number of 361 events and 2 interim analyses at 
approximately 71% and 90% of the target number of events, the study has approximately 
90.7% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.7 at the initially allocated α=0.0215 (1 -sided).
Based on [Burtness, B., et al 2018] , the above sample size and power calculations for PFS 
and OS assume the following:
•PFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 3 months for the control group. 
•OS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 12 months for the control group. 
•Enrollment period of 24 months with enrollment ramp -up over first 6 months. 
•An annual dropout rate of 5% for PFS and OS.
•A follow -up period of 6 and 20 months for PF S and OS, respectively, after the last 
participant is randomized. 
The sample size and power calculations were performed using R (“gsDesign” package) and 
SAS 9.4.
9.10 Subgroup Analyses
To determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across various sub groups, the 
between -group treatment effect for ORR, PFS and OS (with a nominal 95% CI) will be

PRODUCT: MK-7902 154
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
estimated and plotted by treatment group within each category of the following subgroup 
variables:
•Stratification factors 
-PD-L1 tumor expression as determined b y PD -L1 immunohistochemistry (TPS <50% 
vs. ≥50%)
-HPV status for oropharynx cancer as determined by p16 immunohistochemistry 
(positive vs. negative); HPV status for participants without oropharynx cancer (eg, 
cancers of the oral cavity, hypopharynx and lary nx) is considered HPV negative.
-ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1)
•Age category (<65 years, ≥65 years)
•Sex (female, male)
•Race (white, all others)
•Geographic region (North America, European Union, Asia, Rest of the World)
•PD-L1 tumor expression as determined by PD -L1 immunohistochemistry (CPS <50 vs. 
≥50)
A forest plot will be produced, which provides the estimated point estimates and confidence 
intervals for the treatment effect across the categories of subgroups listed above. If the 
number of par ticipants in a category of a subgroup variable is less than 10% of the ITT 
population, the subgroup analysis will not be performed for this category of the subgroup 
variable, and this subgroup variable will not be displayed in the forest plot. The subgroup
analyses for PFS and OS will be conducted using an unstratified Cox model, and the 
subgroup analyses for ORR will be conducted using the unstratified Miettinen and Nurminen 
method.
9.11 Compliance (Medication Adherence)
Drug accountability data for trial treat ment will be collected during the study. Any deviation 
from protocol -directed administration will be reported.
9.12 Extent of Exposure
Extent of exposure for a participant is defined as the number of cycles and number of days in 
which the participant receives t he study intervention. Summary statistics will be provided on 
the extent of exposure for the overall study intervention, and for pembrolizumab and 
lenvatinib separately for the APaT population.

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Append ix1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
10.1.1 Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials
Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC, Rahway, NJ, USA (MSD)
I.Introduction
A.Purpose
MSD through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials wo rldwide to evaluate the safety 
and effectiveness of our products. As such, we are committed to designing, 
implementing , conducting, analyzing, and reporting these trials in compliance with 
the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of partici pants in clinical trials 
is the overriding concern in the design and conduct of clinical trials. In all cases, 
MSD clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or national 
regulations (including all applicable data protection regulations) , and International 
Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) ,and also in 
accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.
B.Scope
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical 
interventional investigations sponsored by MSD irrespective of the party (parties) 
employed for their execution (e.g., contract research organizations, collaborative 
research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in 
nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -
initiated trials, which are not under the full control of MSD.
II.Scientific Issues
A.Trial Conduct
1.Trial Design
Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -
driven to assess safety, efficacy, and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic 
indices of MSD or comparator products. Alternatively, MSD may conduct 
outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or 
trials to determine patient preferences, etc.
The design (i.e., participant population, duration, statistical power) must be 
adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial .Participants must meet 
protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial.
08K59L
PRODUCT: MK-7902 156
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
2.Site Selection
MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate 
participants, adequacy of facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical 
trials, as well as budgetary conside rations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are 
evaluated by MSD personnel (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD) to assess 
the ability to successfully conduct the trial.
3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Investigative trial sites are monitored to as sess compliance with the trial protocol 
and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, 
completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus source documentation 
according to standard operating procedures. Per MSD policies and procedures, if 
fraud, scientific/research misconduct or serious GCP -non-compliance is 
suspected, the issues are investigated. When necessary, the clinical site will be 
closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review committees 
notified.
B.Publication and Authorship
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish the primary and secondary 
results of its registered trials of marketed products in which treatment is assigned, 
according to the pre -specified plans for data analysis. To the e xtent scientifically 
appropriate, MSD seeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are 
important to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pilot trials are 
intended to be hypothesis generating rather than hypothesis testin g; in such cases, 
publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and 
the analyses complicated by statistical issues such as multiplicity.
MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the recommendations published by the 
International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, 
authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the 
trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. 
All named au thors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. MSD 
funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications.
III.Participant Protection
A.Regulatory Authority and Ethics Committee Review (Institutional Review Board 
[IRB]/Independent Ethic s Committee [IEC])
All protocols and protocol amendments will be submitted by MSD for regulatory 
authority acceptance/authorization prior to implementation of the trial or amendment, 
in compliance with local and/or national regulations.
The protocol, proto col amendment(s), informed consent form, investigator’s 
brochure, and other relevant trial documents must be reviewed and approved by an 
IRB/IEC before being implemented at each site, in compliance with local and/or 
national regulations. Changes to the pro tocol that are required urgently to eliminate 
08K59L
PRODUCT: MK-7902 157
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
an immediate hazard and to protect participant safety may be enacted in anticipation 
of ethics committee approval. MSD will inform regulatory authorities of such new 
measures to protect participant safety, in c ompliance with local and/or national 
regulations.
B.Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is 
of primary importance. Potential participants will be informed of the risks and 
benefits of, as well as a lternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs 
will take into account the local standard of care.
All participation in MSD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only 
after informed consent is obtained. Participants ma y withdraw from an MSD trial at 
any time, without any influence on their access to, or receipt of, medical care that 
may otherwise be available to them .
C.Confidentiality
MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent 
possible. Unless required by law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or individuals acting 
on behalf of MSD), ethics committee, and/or regulatory authorities will have access 
to confidential medical records that might identify the participant by name.
D.Genomic Research
Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed 
consent authorized by an ethics committee.
IV.Financial Considerations
A.Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is MSD’s policy to compensate 
investigators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work performed 
in support of MSD trials. MSD does not pay incentives to enroll participants in its 
trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments 
may be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
MSD does not pay for participant referrals. However, MSD may compensate 
referring physicians for time spent on chart review and medical evaluation to identify 
potentially eligible participants.
B.Clinical Research Funding
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by MSD, and that the 
investigator or sponsoring institution is being paid or provided a grant for perfor ming 
the trial. However, the local ethics committee may wish to alter the wording of the 
disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As 
noted above, all publications resulting from MSD trials will indicate MSD as a s ource 
of funding.

study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other 
study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requir ements.
Records and documents, including participants’ documented informed consent, pertaining to 
the conduct of this study must be retained by the investigator for 15 years after study 
completion unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. 
No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the 
Sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written 
notification to the Sponsor.
10.1.9 Source Documents
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. The investigator/institution should maintain adequate and 
accurate source documents and study records that include all pertinent observati ons on each 
of the site’s participants. Source documents and data should be attributable, legible, 
contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data should be 
traceable, should not obscure the original entry, and should be explained if necessary (eg, via 
an audit trail). Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site.
Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents 
must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The 
investigator/institution may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, 
depending on the study. Also, current medical records must be available.

10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
10.3.1 Definitions of Medication Error, Misuse, and Abuse
Medication Error
This is an unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to or has the potential to 
lead to ha rm to the patient.
Misuse
This refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used 
not in accordance with the terms of the product information.
Abuse
This corresponds to the persistent or sporadic intentional ,excessive use of a medicinal 
product for a perceived psychological or physiological reward or desired nontherapeutic 
effect.
10.3.2 Definition of AE
AE definition
•An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention.
•Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study intervention.
•Note: For purposes of AE definition, study intervention includes any pharmaceutical 
product, biological product, vaccine, diagnostic agent, medical device, combination 
product, or pro tocol -specified procedure whether investigational or marketed (including 
placebo, active comparator product, or run -in intervention), manufactured by, licensed 
by, provided by, or distributed by the Sponsor for human use in this study.
Events meeting the AE definition
•Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically signifi cant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the investigator.
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after study i ntervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
•Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study
intervention or a concomitant medication.
•For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the 
AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using 
the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”
Events NOT meeting the AE definition
•Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
•Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
•Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of t he study that do not worsen.
•Surgical procedure(s) planned prior to informed consent to treat a preexisting condition 
that has not worsened.
•Refer to Section 8.4.6 for protocol -specific exceptions.
10.3.3 Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met.
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
-The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
-Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even 
if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: 
Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a pr eexisting condition that has not 
worsened is not an SAE.) A preexisting condition is a clinical condition that is 
diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s 
medical history.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
d.Results in persistent or significant d isability/incapacity
-The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
-This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
-In offspring of participant taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis.
f.Other important medical events
-Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be 
consider ed serious.
-Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias ,or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug depende ncy 
or drug abuse.
10.3.4 Additional Events Reported
Additional events that require reporting
In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not 
serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor.
•Is a new cancer (th at is not the cancer under study) as noted in Section 8.4.1 .
•Is associated with an overdose.
10.3.5 Recording AE and SAE
AE and SAE recording
•When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.
•The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the AE 
CRFs/worksheets at each examination.
•It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the part icipant’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page.

PRODUCT: MK-7902 167
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
•There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
the Sponsor. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the pa rticipant 
number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submission to the 
Sponsor.
•The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the dia gnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of intensity /toxicity
•An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rat ed as severe.
Assessment of causality
Follow -up of AE and SAE
•The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Sponsor to 
elucidate the nature and /or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
•New or updated information will be recorded in the CR F.
•The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
10.3.6 Reporting of AEs, SAEs, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor
AE, SAE, and other reportable safety event reporting to Sponsor via electronic data 
collection tool
•The primary mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the EDC tool.
-Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent).
-If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use 
the paper AE Reporting form.
-Reference Section 8.4.1 for reporting time requirements.
•The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.
•After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be taken off -line to prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data.

PRODUCT: MK-7902 168
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 010-05
MK-7902 -010-05 FINAL PROTOCOL 19-OCT -2023
•If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the E DC tool has been taken off -line, then the site can 
report this information on a paper SAE form or by telephone (see next section).
•Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via paper CRF
•If the EDC tool is not operational, facsimile transmission or secure email of the SAE 
paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Sponsor.
•In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight 
mail or courier service.
•Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designate d reporting time frames.
•Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found 
in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent).

10.5 Appendix 5: Contraceptive Guidance
10.5.1 Definitions
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below):
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot 
be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be 
considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
-Documented hysterectomy
-Documented bilateral salpingectomy
-Documented bilateral oophorectomy
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
-A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.
◦A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be u sed to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or HRT. 
However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with two FSH 
measurements in the postmenopausal range is required.
-Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the nonhormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue 
their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study e nrollment.

10.5.2 Contraceptive Requirements
Contraceptives allowed during the study includea:
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Have Low User Dependency
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
Progestogen -only subdermal contraceptive implantb
IUSc
Nonhormonal IUD
Bilateral tubal occlusion
Azoospermic partner (vasectomized or secondary to medical cause)
This is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner of 
the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method 
of contraception should be used. A spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.
Note: Documentation of azoospermia for a male pa rticipant can come from the site personnel’s review of 
the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
Sexual Abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from het erosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the participant.
aContraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive 
methods for participants of clinical studies.
bIf locally required, in accordance with CTFG guidelines, acceptable contraceptive implants are limi ted to those 
which inhibit ovulation.
cIUS is a progestin releasing IUD.
Note: The following are not acceptable methods of contraception:
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), 
spermicides only, and LAM.
Male condom with cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide.
Male and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction).

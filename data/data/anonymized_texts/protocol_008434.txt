 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This will be a single  center  pilot study  for 12 patients,  designed  to evaluate  the efficacy  of 
ribavirin  monotherapy  for patients  with recurrent  and/or metastatic  (R/M)  HPV-related  
malignancies.  The study  will be conducted  in the Head  and Neck  Service.  
 
Study  subjects  will self-admini ster ribavirin  1400  mg PO BID (total dose, 2800  mg/day).  All 
patients  will complete  pill diaries  to document administration  of study  drug.  Cycle  length  is 
28 days  with continuous  dosing.  
 
Toxicities  will be graded  according  to NCI CTCAE  version  4. 
 
Clinic  visits for safety  assessments  and routine  laboratory  studies  will occur  weekly  in Cycle  
1, in weeks  1 and 3 of Cycle  2, and on Week  1 of subsequent cycles.    Cross  sectional  
imaging  (CT or MRI)  is obtained  at baseline  and q2 cycles  and at End-of Treatment (EOT).  
Response  assessments  will follow  RECIST  1.1 criteria.  
 
Patients may remain  on study  until disease  progression  or unacceptable  toxicity.   Research  
biopsies  at time of progression  will only be obtained  in subjects who have  had an initial  
radiographic  response.

2.0 OBJECTIVES AND  SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
Primary  Objective:   To obtain  a preliminary  efficacy  assessment for ribavirin  monotherapy  among  
patients  with R/M HPV-related  malignancies  
 
Secondary  Objectives:  
(1) To describe  overall  survival and  progression -free survival;  
(2) To describe  the safety  and tolerability  of ribavirin  in this patient population  
(3) To explore  Gli-1 expression,  as detected  by immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  in pre-treatment  
archived  pathology  samples,  as a candidate  biomarker  for efficacy of ribavirin  in these  
cancers;  
(4) Among  subjects  who initially  respond  to ribavirin,  to explore  if subsequent  acquired  resistance  is 
associated  with increased  Gli-1 expression.  
 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
Rationale  for targeting  eIF4E  in HPV-related  cancers  
Viruses  have  developed  myriad  ways  to co-opt the  host cell protein  translational apparatus  in a way 
that favors  virus  production  [1, 2].  In the case  of high risk human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  strains,  this 
has oncogenic  implications.  The HPV E6 viral oncoprotein,    in addition  to its well-established  
interaction  with p53, also directly  activates cap -dependent  protein  translation.   We propose  that 
impinging  on E6-driven  aberrant  cap-dependent protein  translation represents  a new line of attack  
against HPV -related  cancers.  
 
The key regulatory  step in cap-dependent translation is the binding  of eIF4E  (eukaryotic  initiation  
factor  4E) to the translation  initiation  complex  [3]. Research  interest in  eIF4E  in oncology  began  
with the discovery by Dr. Guido  Wendel  (now  at SKI)  that eIF4E  can function  as an oncogene   
when  it is overexpressed  in  a murine  lymphoma  model  [4].  It is now apparent that  elevated  eIF4E  
expression  is a characteristic  of HPV-related  cancers.   Three  clinical research  teams  have  observed  
that  eIF4E  expression  progressively  increases  with degree  of cervical pathology  along  the 
continuum  from normal cervical tissue, to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia  (CIN)/dysplasia,  and  
finally  to invasive  cervical  carcinoma  [5-7].  We also observed  that elevated  expression  of 
phosphorylated  eIF4E  is a characteristic  of HPV-related  tonsil  squamous  cell cancer  in retrospective  
tissue  microarray  analysis  [8]. 
 
We propose  that a positive  feedback  loop, cen tered  at the level of protein  translation,  drives  the 
expression  of both E6 and eIF4E in HPV-related  cancers.   E6 stimulates  the cap-dependent  protein  
translation in vitro [9].  This effect of E6 on protein  translation  is a characteristic  of high-risk 
oncogenic  HPV strains.   Potent stimulation  of cap-dependent translation  in vitro occurs  with E6 
protein  from high-risk HPV16  and HPV18  strains  and from low-risk HPV6b  and HPV11  strains,  but 
does  not occur  with E6 from non-oncogenic  HPV5  and HPV8  [10] (Figure  1).

Figure  1:  Mucosal but not  cutaneous  HPV E6 proteins  increase  cap-dependent  protein  
translation . U20S  cells were  transiently  co-transfected  with the pFR-CrPV -xb bicistronic  
luciferase  reporter construct  and expression  vectors  for high-risk mucosal  HPV E6 proteins  
(HPV  16, HPV  18),  low risk mucosal  HPV E6 proteins  (HPV6b,  HPV 11), cutaneous  HPV E6 
proteins  (HPV5,  HPV 8), or empty vector (C) as control.  The Y axis indicates  the ratio 
(FF/Ren) of expression  of Firefly  (FF) reporter, which  is cap dependent, to Renilla  (Ren)  
reporter,  which  is cap-independent.  (Spangle. JM, Ghosh -Choudhury, N., Munger,  K.  2012  
J Virol 86:   7466 -7472)   [10]. 
 
 
 
Because   E6 is encoded  on a capped  mRNA  [11], it is likely  that there  is a positive  feedback  loop in 
which  expression  of E6 and expression  of eI4E are mutually  amplified  (Figure  2).  Additionally,  there  
may be further  positive feedback  at the transcriptional level  because  E6 induces  transcription  of 
eIF4E in cell lines  [5] (Figure  2).

cap-binding  protein  eIF4E :  The E6 oncoprotein  (pink)  stimulates  cap-dependent  protein  
translation  [9, 10], in which  the binding  of  eIF4E  to the m7G mRNA  cap is a rate-limiting  step 
[3].  Because  E6 is encoded  by capped  mRNA  [11], a positive  feedback  loop (solid  arrowed  
lines)   may be induced  at the level of protein  translation.    There  may also be a positive  
feedback  loop at the transcriptional  level due  the ability  of E6 to induce  transcription  of the 
eIF4E  gene  [5] (dotted  arrowed  lines).  
 
 
 
 
Ribavirin  is an antiviral agent that may be re-purposed  for oncology  due to eIF4E  targeting  
In 1972, the guanosine  ribonucleotide  analogue  ribavirin  (Virazole;  1-β-D-ribofuranosyl -1,2,4 - 
triazole -3-carboxamide)  was reported  to have  broad  spectrum  activity against  both RNA  and DNA  
viruses  [12]. The most  common  adverse  events  associated  with ribavirin  are mild anemia, cough,  
and rash.   For patients  treated  with prolonged  ribavirin,  anemia  usually  is mild and hemoglobin  
remains  in the normal  range  [13, 14].  The combination  of ribavirin  + peginterfer on α-2b has been  
approved  by the Food  and Drug  Administration  as effective  treatment  for chronic  hepatitis  C [15, 16]. 
 
In the otolaryngology  literature, ribavirin  is known  to have  activity against  laryngeal  papillomatosis  
(LP), a rare HPV-related  disease  in which  the upper  airway  becomes  progressively  occluded  with 
benign  mucosal papillomas.   Repeated  laser surgery  for removal of lesions  has been  commonly  
applied  as a management  strategy.  In a small  pilot study,  patients  (3 adults, 1 child) received  pre- 
operative  ribavirin  (23 mg/kg  daily)  on the day of laser  surgery, and  continued  oral ribavirin  at the 
same  daily dose  for an additional 6 months  (only  3 months  for the child). The  viral strain  was HPV 6 
in the papillomas  of three  patients, and  was HPV 11 in one patient. Ribavirin  treatment was 
associated  a decrease  in observable  disease  on follow  up examinations,  as determined  by a 
previously  described  mapping  score.  Ribavirin  treatment  was associated  with an increase  in the time 
interval between  successive  required  surgeries  by a factor  of at least 2 in all patients  [17]. The 
efficacy  of ribavirin  against  LP was confirmed  in a subsequent case  report  [18], and ribavirin  is 
considered  to be one treatment  option  for this uncommon  entity  [19]. 
 
In 2004,  Dr. Alex Kentsis  (now  at SKI, but then  working  in the lab of Dr. Katherine  Borden) published  
that ribavirin  has anti-cancer  activity pre-clinically  that is directly  related  to eIF4E -targetin g  [20].  In 
xenograft  experiments  with an eIF4E -depedent head  and neck SCC cell line  (FaDu), ribavirin

 treatment  (40 µg/kg daily)  yielded  tumor  volume  that was 6-fold less than in the untreated  control  
group  (Figure  3) [20]. Dr. Borden’s  group subsequently  studied  ribavirin  in M4/M5  acute myeloid  
leukemia  (AML),  another tumor type that is  characterized  by elevated  eIF4E expression.   In a proof  
of principle  trial, ribavirin  demonstrated  encouraging  activity,  with 1 complete  remission, 2 partial  
responses,  2 blast responses,  4 stable  diseases, and  2 progressive  diseases  among  11 evaluable  
patients  with M4/M5  AML. [21].

Dr. Borden’s  group  has moved  beyond  the initial  description  of the anticancer  efficacy  of ribavirin  in 
AML,  to describe  recently  the most  common  mechanism  of resistance  to this drug:   glucuronidation  
of ribavirin,  mediated  by the sonic  hedgehog  factor Gli -1 [22]. Ribavirin  binds  eIF4E in sensitive  
FaDu  cells,  but not in FRII cells  with acquired  resistance  (Figure  4A). RNASeq  demonstrates  that 
ribavirin -resistant FRII cells have 21-fold elevation  of Gli-1 [22]. Gli-1 upregulation  leads to ribavirin  
glucuronidation.    Pre-treatment  of resistant cells  with GDC -0449  (vismodegib, a small  molecule  
inhibitor  of sonic  hedgehog  signaling  upstream of Gli-1) restored  sensitivity  to ribavirin  (Figure  4B). 
Conversely, forced over-expression  of Gli-1 in FaDu  cells conferred  resistance  to ribavirin  [22]. This 
mechanism also  was observed  in AML patients  with acquire d resistance  to ribavirin  in a phase  II trial 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; manuscript  in preparation, K. Borden,  pers. comm.).  These  mechanistic  insights  
into ribavirin  resistance  mechanism can inform the  subsequent  development of ribavirin  in oncology.

Potential  future  implications:  targeting  eIF4E  in combination  therapy  regimens  
We now seek  to develop  ribavirin  as an eIF4E -targeting  strategy  in HPV-related  cancers.   We 
envision  that this approach  could  mature  into future  vertical inhibition  strategies  with other  inhibitors  
of the PI3K/mTOR  (phosphatidylinoslitol -3 kinase  /mammalian  target  of rapamycin)  pathway.   eIF4E  
is downstream of mTOR  in the PI3K/mTOR  pathway,  and there  appears  to be a convergence  of 
molecular  alterations  on this pathway  in HPV-related  cancers.    Mutations  in PIK3CA , the gene  
encoding  the catalytic  subunit  of PI3K,  occur  in approximately  25-30% of HPV related  oropharynx  
cancers [23].  Cervical cancer  studies  have  reported  PIK3CA  mutation  rates  of 14% to 31% [24, 25]. 
Although  other  anogenital cancers have  been less well studied,  one report demonstrated  that 
PIK3CA  hotspot mutations  occur  in 16% of anal cancers  [26] and aberrant  expression  of eIF4E  has 
been  described  in penile  squamous  cell cancer  [27].  The convergence  of molecular  alterations  
along  this pathway in HPV-related  cancers  suggests  a strategy  of blocking  the pathway  at upstream  
(PI3K)  and downstream (eIF4E)  locations.  
 
The first-in-human  trial of BYL719,  an orally  administered  α-specific  PI3K inhibitor,  provided  
encouraging  results  against  HPV-related  head  and neck  cancer.  In this phase  I trial for 72 patients  
with advanced  solid tumors  harboring  PIK3CA  alterations, 2 of the 3 best radiographic  
 
responses  in the study  occurred  in HPV positive  head  and neck  cancers [28]. This phase  I 
observation  has prompted further  study  of BYL719  against  head  and neck  cancers (MSKCC  IRB 14- 

MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB#: 14-211 A (7)

 116 and 14-021 [29]). It is likely  that targeting  PI3K  may have  useful  activity against other  HPV- 
related  tumors  as well.  However,  in order to obtain  deeper  and more  durable  responses,   we 
anticipate  that combination  therapy  strategies  will be necessary.  If ribavirin  demonstrates  clinically  
useful activity against  HPV-related  cancers,  vertical inhibition  to completely  shut down  the 
PI3K/mTOR/eIF4E  axis in HPV-related  cancers  could  be achieved  by combining  ribavirin  with a 
PI3K inhibitor.  In view of the central role  that radiation  therapy  plays  in the clinical management  of 
HPV related  cancers , future  studies  could  also seek  to build  on the preclinical observation  that 
targeting  of eIF4E  with ribavirin  achieves  radiosensitization  against  cancer  cell lines [30]. 
 
Preliminary  Data:  
To determine  if ribavirin  targets  eIF4E  in HPV-related  cancers,  we conducted  a pilot ‘window  of 
opportunity” study  to evaluate  the pharmacodynamic  effects  of ribavirin  on the  expression  of 
phosphorylated  eIF4E  in HPV-associated  oropharynx  squamous  cell cancer  (MSKCC  IRB 10-218; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  The primary endpoint was to determine  if ribavirin  reduces  phosphorylated  eIF4E  
expression  in post-treatment biopsy  samples, as evaluated  by IHC. Patients  received  ribavirin  for 
approximately  two weeks,  and underwent  pre and post-treatment  tumor  biopsies.   Among  6 
evaluable  patients, marked  reductions  of the expression  of phosphorylated  eIF4E were detected  in 4 
cases.  One patient was inevaluable  because  there  were  no viable  cells on the  fine-needed  aspirate  
of tumor  after 2 weeks  of ribavirin  treatment, but he did have  marked  reduction  in jaw pain during  
treatment  period  with ribavirin.  The results  are summarized  in Table  1, and Figure  5 illustrates  a 
representative  case.  IRB 10-218 was not a study  for therapeutic  intent; study  drug was given  only 
for 2 weeks  only.   IRB 10-218 provides further  evidence  that ribavirin  targets  eIF4E, strengthening  
the rationale  for the proposed  therapeutic  study.

Dr. Katherine  Borden  and colleagues  at the University of Montreal  studied  ribavirin  in a phase  I/II 
study  for AML (ClinicalTrials.gov  identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), another malignancy  that expresses  high 
levels  of eIF4E.  They  established  that the phase  II recommended  dose  of ribavirin  in oncology  is 
1400  mg PO BID (K. Borden,  pers. comm., clinical manuscript  in preparation;  correlative  science  
data from [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  has been  published  [22]). As such,  the ribavirin  dosing  for oncology  
studies  differs  from the dosing  of this drug for hepatitis  C [15]. 
 
We now propose  a pilot “basket study” for patients  with any R/M HPV related  cancer (oropharynx , 
cervical,  vulvar,  vaginal, anal,  and penile)  for which  there  is not a curative -intent standard  therapy  
option.

4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This will be a single -institution  pilot trial.  The primary endpoint  is to obtain  a preliminary  efficacy  
assessment for ribavirin monotherapy  among  patients  with R/M HPV-related  malignancies.  There  is 
no randomization  or dose  escalation.  
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
Subjects  will self administer ribavirin  1400 mg PO BID (total, 2800  mg/day).   Cycle  length  is 28  days  
with continuous  dosing.   Toxicities  will be graded  according  to NCI CTCAE  version  4.  Clinic  visits  
for safety  assessments  and routine  laboratory studies  will occur  weekly  in Cycle  1, in weeks  1 and 3 
of Cycle  2, and on Week  1 of subsequent cycles.    Cross  sectional imaging  (CT or MRI)  is obtained  
at baseline  and q2 cycles  and at End-of Treatment (EOT).  Response  assessments  will follow  
RECIST  1.1 criteria.   Patients  may remain  on study until disease  progression  or unacceptable  
toxicity.   At time  of progression  of disease, research  biopsies  will only be obtained  in patients  who 
had initial radiographic  response.  
 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
 
Ribavirin  
Availability  and Administration:  
 
Generic  ribavirin  is commercially  available  as 200 mg, 400mg, and  600 mg tablets, which  will 
be orally  administered  by the patients  themselves.   Ribavirin  will be purchased  from the 
hospital pharmacy.  Tablets  are supplied  in bottles  of 84 capsules  (200 mg each).  Ribavirin  is 
available  as blue-colored  (shade  depending  on strength),  capsule -shaped,  film-coated  
tablets.   Medication  labels  will comply  with US legal requirements  and be printed  in English.  
The storage  conditions  for study  drug will be described  on the medication  label.  Ribavirin  
tablet  should  be taken  with food (but it  will not be considered  a protocol  violation  if a subject  
takes  dose  on an empty  stomach).  
 
 
Pharmacology:  
 
Ribavirin oral tablet administration  is characterized  by rapid  absorption with a tmax of 
approximately  2 hours, followed  by rapid  distribution  and long terminal  phases.  Mean  γ- 
phase  half-life has been  reported  to be  in the range  of approximately  30 - 61 hours after a 
single  dose,  and 274 - 296 hours  following  multiple  doses.  Mean  bioavailabil ity is 
approximately  30 - 50%.  Apparent plasma  clearance  is approximately  20 L/h.  Population  
based  pharmacokinetic  models  have  identified  factors associated  with lower  apparent  
clearance  of ribavirin  (female  gender,  higher  age, and low body  weight),  but taken  
together these  factors account for less than 30% of the variability  in clearance  [31-34].

 7.1 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
Potential research  subjects  will be identified  by a member  of the patient’s  treatment team,  the 
protocol  investigator, or research  team  here at Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
(MSKCC).  If the investigator is  a member of the treatment team, s/he  will screen  their 
patient’s  medical records  for suitable  research  study  participants  and discus  the study  and 
their potential  for enrolling  in the research  study.  
 
The principal  investigator may also screen  the medical records  of patients  with whom  they do 
not have  a treatment relationship  for the limited  purpose  of identifying  patients  who would  be 
eligible  to enroll  in the study  and to record  appropriate  contact  information  in order to 
approach  these  patients  regarding  the possibility  of enrolling  in the study.  
 
During  the initial conversation  between  the investigator/research  staff and  the patient, the 
patient may be asked  to provide  certain  health  information  that is necessary  to the 
recruitment and  enrollment  process. The investigator/research  staff may also review portions  
of the medical records  at MSKCC  in order to further  assess  eligibility.   They  will use the  
information  provided  by the patient and/or medical  record  to confirm that the  patient is  eligible  
and to  contact the  patient regarding  study  enrollment.  If the patient turns  out to be     
ineligible  for the research  study, the research  staff will destroy  all information  collected  on the 
patient  during  the initial conversation  and medical  records  review,  except for any information  
that must be maintained  for screening  log purposes.  
 
In most  cases, the initial contact with the prospective  subject  will be conducted  either  by the 
treatment team, investigator or the research  staff working  in consultation  with the treatment  
team. The recruitment process  outlined  presents  no more  than minimal  risk to the privacy  of 
the patients  who are screened  and minimal PHI  will be maintained  as part of a screening  log. 
For these  reasons,  we seek  a (partial)  limited  waiver  of authorization  for the purposes  of 1) 
reviewing  medical records  to identify  potential research  subjects  and obtain  information  
relevant  to the enrollment  process;  2) conversing  with patients  regarding  possible  enrollment;  
3) handling  of PHI contained  within  those records  and provided  by the potential  subjects;  and 
4) maintaining  information  in a screening  log of patients  approached.

9.0 TREATMENT/ INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
9.1 Clinical  Plan  
 
Study  subjects  will self-administer  ribavirin  1400  mg PO BID (total dose, 2800  mg/day).  
Ribavirin  should  be taken  with food,  not in  a fasting  condition.  
All patients  will complete  pill diaries  to document administration  of study  drug.  Patients should  be 
instructed  to bring  completed  pill diaries  and all pill bottles  to each  visit. 
 
Cycle  length is 28  days  with continuous  dosing.  Clinic  visits for safety  assessments  and routine  
laboratory  studies  will occur  weekly  in Cycle  1, in weeks  1 and  3 of Cycle 2, and on Week  1 of 
subsequent cycles  (+ 3 days).   Although  clinic  visits  and lab tests  should  generally  occur  on the 
same  day each  week  to facilitate  continuity  with providers,  there  is no  requirement regarding  the day 
of the week  of these  visits.  
 
Toxicities  will be graded  according  to NCI CTCAE  version  4. 
 
Cross  sectional imaging  (CT or MRI)  is obtained  at baseline  and q2 cycles.  Imaging  scans  will be 
scheduled  to occur  in the last week  (± 2 days) of each  even -numbered  cycle.   However,  after 
completion  of cycle  4, the interval between  scans  may be increased  to q3 cycles,  at the discretion  of 
the investigator.  
 
Response  assessments  will follow  RECIST  1.1 criteria  (See  Section  12). 
 
Patients may remain  on study until disease  progression  or unacceptable  toxicity.    There  will be a 
post-treatment  visit 30 days (± 7 days)  from last  dose  of drug for patients  who maintain  active follow  
up. If  a patient is  unable  to attend  the post-treatment  visit due to medical or logistical issues  or lost to  
follow -up, this will not be a protocol  violation.  
 
 
9.2 Immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  
 
Anti Gli-1 antibody  (Glioma  associated  oncogene  1; H-300 rabbit polyclonal,  Santa  Cruz  
Biotechnology,  sc-20687)  has been  used  extensively  for IHC in studies  of cervix  cancer  and head  
and neck  cancer [35, 36] and will be optimized  for IHC in our Pathology  Core.   Formalin -fixed  
paraffin -embedded  (FFPE)  slides  will be prepared  in the  Department  of Pathology  according  to 
standard  practices, and  will be analyzed  by Dr. Nora  Katabi.   Archived  FFPE  pre-treatment tumor  
samples  will be processed  for IHC detection  of Gli-1 and  scored  by the study  pathologist (scale  0-3 
dichotomized  to low/high).  
 
For any patients  who initially  experience  a radiographic  response  to ribavirin  by RECIST  1.1 
(confirmed  or unconfirmed),  at time of subsequent disease  progression  a research  tumor biopsy  will 
be obtained  (unless  such  biopsy  is deemed  to pose  unacceptable  safety  risk).  Gli-1 expression  will 
be assessed  by IHC, in  an effort to explore  if increased  Gli-1 expression  (compared  with pre- 
treatment tissue) may be associated  with acquired  resistance  to ribavirin  in patients  with HPV- 
related malignancies.   These  post-treatment  biopsies  should  generally  be obtained  within  2 weeks  
of the last dose  of ribavirin,  although  it will not be considered  a violation  if the biopsy  occurs  outside  
of this time window.   The gauge  of the needle  will be at  the discretion  of the interventional  
radiologist,  although  18 gauge  is preferred.

11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
11.2 General  Considerations  
 
Ribavirin  Toxicities:  
Hematologic:   anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia,  lymphopenia  
Gastrointestinal:   anorexia,  nausea,  diarrhea  
Hepatic:   elevated  liver function  tests  
Pulmonary:   dyspnea, cough  
Reproductive:   may be teratogen  
Constitutional:  fatigue,  musculoskeletal  pain 
Dermatologic:  alopecia, pruritus, rash 
Neurologic:   headache, dizziness  
Endocrine  and metabolic:   hyperuricemia  
 
The listed ribavirin  toxicities  include those  side effects  described  in the  treatment  of hepatitis  C in 
which  ribavirin  may be given in combination  with peginterferon  alfa [13-16], and those  side effects  
described  in other  settings including  oncology  research  in which  ribavirin  was given  at doses up to  
1400 mg  po BID [37][17, 21]. 
Even  when  the patient meets  criteria for continued  treatment at full dose  per the protocol,  the 
investigator retains  the discretion  to delay  the next treatment  and/or reduce  ribavirin  dose if there  
are safety concerns  and/or  logistical issues.  Any dose  reductions  not specified  in the protocol  
should  be discussed  with the principal  investigator.  
 
Doses  that have  been  reduced  for toxicity  must  not be re-escalated.  
 
Treatment delays  of up to 21 total days  per cycle  are allowed  in a given  cycle.   Any patient  who 
requires  a treatment  delay of >21 days, for medical and/or logistical reasons,  in a given  cycle  should  
be removed  from study.  
 
If an investigator  feels  that a patient requires  a dose  reduction  and/or dose  delay  other  than those  
specified  herein, this may  be allowed  after communication  with the Principal Investigator,  and would  
not be considered  protocol violation.   If the Principal Investigator is  unavailable,  Co-PI or designated  
covering  investigator may  address  such  issues  as they arise.  
 
Dose  modifcation  guidelines  in this section  are only for those  adverse  events  thought to be at least  
possibly  related  to ribavirin.

 11.3 Hematologic  Toxicity  Management  
 
Hemoglobin  
 
The most common  toxicity  requiring  dose  reduction  for ribavirin  is anemia.  
 
For any patient who experiences  a fall in hemoglobin  of > 3 g/dL (from Day  1 value;  or from the 
hemoglobin  value  at the time of the previous  dose  reduction)  and/or a drop in hemoglobin  level to < 
8.0 g/dL,  ribavirin  dose will be decreased  by one dose  level.  
 
Packed  Red Blood  Cell (PRBC)  transfusion  for symptomatic  anemia  is allowed,  at the discretion  of 
the investigator.   However, any  PRBC  transfusion  must  be accompanied  by dose  reduction  by one 
dose  level.   For any  patient  who requires  PRBC  transfusion, repeat complete  cell count  should  be 
obtain  within  1 week  after completion  of the transfusion  to provide  a new  baseline  hemoglobin  level 
for consideration  of subsequent  hemoglobin  levels.  
 
Absolute  Neutrophil Count (ANC)  and Platelets  
 
ANC  (K/mcL)  and 
Platelet  Count  (K/mcL)  
ANC  ≥ 1.0 and Plts ≥ 100: Treat  
without  dose  reduction.  
ANC  < 1.0 and/or Platelets <100:  
Hold.  If repeat  ANC  the next week  
≥ 1.0 and repeat  Plts next week  ≥ 
100, resume  treatment.  Dose  
reduction  by one dose  level is not 
mandatory,  but is  allowed  at the  
discretion  of the investigator.  
Febrile  Neutropenia* : Hold until 
resolution.  When  ANC  ≥ 1.5 and 
afebrile  and Plts ≥ 100, may 
proceed but reduce  by 1 dose  level 
 
 
Dose  delays  and dose  reductions  are not required  for uncomplicated  leukopenia,  uncomplicated  
lymphopenia,  or other abnormal values  in the complete  blood  cell count (other than  hemoglobin  
ANC,  and platelets) without  clinical consequence.

treatment  according  to this table.  
 
1 Upon  recovery,  resume  treatment at full dose  or reduce  by 1 dose  level,  at the discretion  
of the investigator.  
2Upon recovery,  resume  treatment  at next lower  dose  level 
 
11.3.2  Bilirubin  
 
Total bilirubin  > ULN but ≤ 1.5 X ULN:   May hold treatment, treat  at full dose,  or treat at reduced  
dose,  at the discretion  of the investigator  
 
Total bilirubin  > 1.5 X ULN:   Hold treatment  until serum  total bilirubin  is ≤ 1.5 X ULN (maximum  21

the Cockcroft  and Gault Equation.  
 
Calculated  Creatinine  
Clearance  (CrCl)  Management

clinically  indicated.  
 
If repeat  CrCl ≥ 45 ml/min, may resume  
treatment  at the next lower  dose  level of 
ribavirin  
 
 
11.5 Diarrhea  
 
Grade  1 or Grade  2 Diarrhea:  
Ribavirin  treatment  may be continued  at full dose, continued  at the next lower  dose  level,  or held.  
Antidiarrheals  may be used  as needed.  Dose  reduction  is at the discretion  of the investigator.  
 
Grade  3 Diarrhea:  
In the event  of diarrhea  requiring  hospitalization  (ie, Grade  3), supportive  measures  may include  
hydration,  octreotide,  and antidiarrheals.  
 
Ribavirin  treatment  will be held until diarrhea  has improved  to ≤ Grade  1, with dose  reductions  as 
follows:  
 
If Grade  3 diarrhea  duration  is ≤ 48 hours,  the next treatment may be given  at full dose  or at the next 
lower  dose  level,  at the discretion  of the investigator.  
 
If Grade  3 diarrhea  duration  is > 48 hours, subsequent  ribavirin  should  be given  at the next lower  
dose  level

ribavirin  may be resumed  at the  next lower  dose  level of ribavirin.   Anti-emetics  may be incorporated  
at the discretion  of the investigator.  
 
 
11.7 Non-hematologic  toxicity  not otherwise specified  
 
Dose  delay  and/or dose  reduction  is optional at the discretion  of the investigator as regards  the 
following  ≥ grade 3  adverse  events:  dental  adverse  events, hearing -related  adverse  events, INR  or 
aPTT  elevation,  insomnia,  weight  gain or weight  loss, SIADH,  low bicarbonate, low  albumin,  
hypophosphatemia.   Similarly,  the decision  regarding  whether to institute  dose  modifications for 
grade  2 or 3 fatigue  will be at  the discretion  of the investigator.  
 
For non-hematologic  toxicity  not otherwise  specified:  
 
 ≥ Grade  3: Interrupt  until resolved  to ≤ grade  1, then:  
If resolution  to grade  ≤1 in ≤ 7 days, resume  ribavi rin at the current  
dose  level or at next lower  dose  level,  at investigator  
discretion  
If resolution  to grade  ≤1 in > 7 days, resume  ribavirin  at one lower  
dose  level 
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
 
Response  and progression  will be evaluated  in this study  using  modified  international criteria  
proposed  by the revised  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors (RECIST) guideline  (version  
1.1) [38].  Changes  in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement)  of the tumor  lesions  and 
the shortest diameter  in the case of malignant lymph  nodes  are used  in the RECIST  criteria.   The 
schedule  for scan  assessments  is provided  in Section  10. 
 
12.1.1  Definitions  
 
Evaluable  for toxicity .  All patients  will be evaluable  for toxicity  from the time of their first treatment  
on study.  
 
Evaluable  for objective  response.  Only those  patients  who have  measurable  disease  present at 
baseline,  have  received  at least one  cycle  of therapy,  and have  had their disease  re-evaluated  will 
be considered  evaluable  for response.  These  patients  will have  their response  classified  according  
to the definitions  stated  below.  (Note:   Patients  who exhibit  objective  disease  progression  prior to 
the end of cycle  1 will also be considered  evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable  Non-Target Disease  Response .  Patients  who have  lesions  present  at baseline  that are 
evaluable  but do not meet the definitions  of measurable  disease, have  received  at least  one cycle  of 
therapy,  and have  had their disease  re-evaluated  will be considered  evaluable  for non-target  
disease.  The response  assessment  is based  on the presence, absence, or unequivocal  progression  
of the lesions.

12.1.2  Disease  Parameters  
 
Measurable  disease .  Measurable  lesions  are defined  as those  that can be accurately  measured  in 
at least one  dimension  (longest  diameter to be  recorded)  as >20 mm by chest  x-ray, as >10 mm 
with CT scan,  or >10 mm with calipers  by clinical exam.   All tumor measurements  must  be 
recorded  in millimeters (or decimal  fractions  of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions  that are situated  in a previously irradiated  area might  or might  not be 
considered  measurable.   If the investigator thinks  it appropriate to include  them, the conditions  
under  which  such lesions  should  be considered  must  be discussed  with the principle  investigator.  
 
Malignant  lymph  nodes.  To be considered  pathologically  enlarged  and measurable,  a lymph  node  
must  be >15 mm in short axis when  assessed by  CT scan  (CT scan  slice thickness  recommended  
to be  no greater than  5 mm).  At baseline  and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured  and 
followed.  
 
Non-measurable  disease .  All other  lesions  (or sites  of disease),  including  small  lesions  (longest  
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph  nodes  with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis),  are considered  
non-measurable  disease.   Bone  lesions, leptomeningeal  disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial  
effusions,  lymphangitis  cutis/pulmonitis,  inflammatory breast  disease, and  abdominal  masses  (not 
followed  by CT or MRI),  are considered  as non-measurable.  
 
Note:   Cystic lesions  that meet the criteria  for radiographically  defined  simple  cysts  should  not be 
considered  as malignant  lesions  (neither  measurable  nor non-measurable) since  they are, by 
definition,  simple  cysts.  
 
‘Cystic  lesions’  thought to  represent cystic  metastases  can be considered  as measurable  lesions, if 
they meet  the definition  of measurability  described  above.  However,  if non-cystic  lesions  are 
present  in the same  patient, these  are preferred  for selection  as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable  lesions  up to a maximum  of 2 lesions  per organ  and 5 lesions  in 
total, representative  of all involved  organs,  should  be identified  as target lesions  and recorded  
and measured  at baseline.  Target  lesions  should  be selected  on the basis  of their size (lesions  
with the longest diameter), be representative  of all involved  organs,  but in  addition  should  be those  
that lend  themselves  to reproducible  repeated  measurements.   It may be the case  that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion  does  not lend itself to reproducible  measurement  in which  
circumstance  the next largest  lesion  which  can be  measured  reproducibly  should  be selected.  A 
sum of the diameters  (longest for non-nodal  lesions,  short axis for nodal  lesions) for all target  
lesions  will be calculated  and reported  as the baseline  sum diameters.  If lymph  nodes  are to be  
included  in the sum,  then only the short axis is added  into the sum.  The baseline  sum diameters  
will be used  as reference  to further  characterize  any objective  tumor regression  in the measurable  
dimension  of the disease.  
 
Non-target  lesions .  All other  lesions  (or sites of disease)  including  any measurable  lesions  over 
and above  the 5  target  lesions  should  be identified  as non-target lesions and should  also be 
recorded  at baseline.  Measurements  of these  lesions  are not required,  but the presence,  absence,  
or in rare cases  unequivocal  progression  of each  should  be noted  throughout follow -up. 
 
 
12.1.3  Methods  for Evaluation  of Measurable  Disease  
Page  25 of 37 
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB#: 14-211 A (7) 
APPROVED:  19 DEC  2016   
 All measurements  should  be taken  and recorded  in metric  notation  using  a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline  evaluations  should  be performed  as closely  as possible  to the beginning  of treatment  and 
never  more  than 4 weeks  prior to registration.  
 
The same  method  of assessment  and the same  technique  should  be used  to characterize  each  
identified  and reported  lesion  at baseline  and during  follow -up. Imaging -based  evaluation  is 
preferred  to evaluation  by clinical e xamination  unless  the lesion(s)  being  followed  cannot  be imaged  
but are assessable  by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions  will only be considered  measurable  when  they are superficial  (e.g.,  
skin nodules  and palpable  lymph  nodes) and  10 mm diameter as assessed  using  calipers  (e.g.,  
skin nodules).  In the case  of skin lesions, documentation  by color photography,  including  a ruler to 
estimate  the size of the lesion,  is recommended.  
 
Chest  x-ray Lesions  on chest  x-ray are acceptable  as measurable  lesions  when  they are clearly  
defined  and surrounded  by aerated  lung.  However,  CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT  and MRI  This guideline  has defined  measurability  of lesions  on CT scan  based  on 
the assumption  that CT slice thickness  is 5 mm or less. If CT scans  have  slice thickness  greater  
than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable  lesion  should  be twice  the slice thickness.   MRI is 
also acceptable  in certain  situations  (e.g. for body  scans).  
 
12.1.4  Response  Criteria  
 
12.1.4.1  Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
 
Complete  Response  (CR) : Disappearance  of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph  nodes  
(whether  target or non-target) must  have  reduction  in short  axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response  (PR): At least a 30% decrease  in the sum of the diameters  of target  lesions,  
taking  as reference  the baseline  sum diameters.  
 
Progressive  Disease  (PD):  At least a 20% increase  in the sum of the diameters  of target lesions,  
taking  as reference  the smallest  sum on study  (this includes  the baseline  sum if that is the 
smallest  on study).  In addition  to the relative  increase  of 20%, the sum must  also 
demonstrate  an absolute  increase  of at least 5 mm. (Note:   the appearance  of one or more  
new lesions  is also considered  progressions).  
 
Stable  Disease  (SD):  Neither  sufficient shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient increase  to qualify  
for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest  sum diameters  while  on study.  
 
12.1.4.2  Evaluation  of Non-Target Lesions  
 
Complete  Response  (CR) :  Disappearance  of all non-target lesions  and normalization  of tumor  
marker  level.   All lymph  nodes  must be non-pathological in  size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note:   If tumor markers  are initially  above  the upper  normal limit, they must  normalize for a patient t o 
be considered  in complete  clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence  of one or more  non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance  of tumor  
marker  level above  the normal limits.  
Page  26 of 37 
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB#: 14-211 A (7) 
APPROVED:  19 DEC  2016   
 Progressive  Disease  (PD):  Appearance  of one or more  new lesions  and/or  unequivocal  progression  
of existing  non-target  lesions.   Unequivocal  progression  should  not normally  trump  target lesion  
status.  It must  be representative  of overall  disease  status  change, not a single  lesion  increase.  
 
Although  a clear progression  of “non-target” lesions  only is exceptional,  the opinion  of the treating  
physician  should  prevail  in such  circumstances, and  the progression  status  should  be confirmed  at a 
later time  by the review  panel  (or Principal  Investigator).  
 
12.1.4.3  Evaluation  of Best Overall  Response  
 
The best overall  response  is the  best response  recorded  from the start of the treatment until  disease  
progression/recurrence  (taking  as reference  for progressive  disease  the smallest measurements  
recorded  since  the treatment started).  The patient's  best response  assignment will depend  on the 
achievement  of both measurement  and confirmation  criteria.

progression  at that time  should  be reported  as “symptomatic  
deterioration.”  Every effort  should  be made  to document the objective

not advised  
 
 
12.1.5  Duration  of Response  
 
Duration  of overall response : The duration  of overall  response  is measured  from the time 
measurement  criteria  are met for CR or PR (whichever  is first recorded) until  the first date  that 
recurrent or progressive  disease  is objectively  documented  (taking  as reference  for progressive  
disease  the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the treatment  started).  
The duration  of overall  CR is measured  from the time measurement criteria  are first met for CR until 
the first date  that progressive  disease  is objectively  documented.  
 
Duration  of stable  disease : Stable  disease  is measured  from the start of the treatment until  the 
criteria  for progression  are met, taking  as reference  the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the 
treatment  started,  including  the baseline  measurements.  
 
12.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
 
PFS is  defined  as the duration  of time from start of treatment to time of progression  or death,  
whichever  occurs  first. 
. 
 
 
13.0 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
Any patient  who experiences  toxicity  requiring  ribavirin  dose reduction  below  “dose  level 
minus  3” (See  Section  11.1)  will be removed  from study.  
 
Any subject  who requires  treatment delay  of more  than 21 days  in a given  cycle  will be 
removed  from study.  
 
If at any time the patient develops  progressive  disease,  he/she  will be taken  off study.  
Patients may be removed  from the study  for protocol  non-compliance.  
If at any time the patient develops  unacceptable  toxicity,  he/she  will be removed  from 
study.

Participants can be  removed  from the study  at any time if the study  doctor  feels  that it  is in 
their best interest  to do  so. 
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
A sample  size of 12 patients  will be accrued and  followed  until progression  of disease  (or until 
removal of study  for other medical/logistical reasons), in  this pilot study  with the objective  to obtain  
preliminary  evidence  of efficacy  in the selected  patient  population  of R/M HPV related  malignancies.  
Radiographic  responses, determined  by RECIST  1.1 criteria,  will be tabulated  by adding  partial  
responses  and complete  responses  (CR + PR).  The best response  for each  patient during  the study  
will be used.  
 
Efficacy  considerations  for the statistical design  of this study  are informed  by historical  data 
regarding  second -line or greater  systemic  therapy  for patients  with recurrent/metastatic  (R/M)  head  
and neck  cancer, cervical cancer,  or anal cancer.  Among  patients  with R/M head  and neck  cancer,  
the historical estimate  for objective  response  rate with palliative  chemotherapy  after first line  is 15% 
[39, 40]. Similarly,  the response  rate of palliative  single  agent  chemotherapy  for advanced  cervical  
cancer  is approximately  15-20% [41, 42]. For R/M anal cancer,  no regimen  has been  shown  to be 
effective  after first  line platinum + 5-fluorouracil  [43]. 
 
The regimen  would  be considered  worthy  of further  study  if radiographic  responses  are observed  in 
at least 2 of 12 subjects.  The probability  of missing  an effect (observing  0 or 1 responses  out of 12 
patients  if the true response  rate is 30%), is  0.09. Overall  Survival and  Progression -Free Survival  will 
be estimated  with the Kaplan -Meier  method.  
 
Tissue  correlative  studies  will be for purposes  of hypothesis  generation.  We will explore  if the anti- 
Gli-1 IHC score  (scale  0-3 dichotomized  to low/high)  is related  to response  (CR+PR) using  Chi- 
square  or Fisher’s  exact test.  The following  provisional scoring  system  will be used  (% refers  to 
percentage  of tumor  cells that stain  positively  [cytoplasm  and/or nucleus]  for Gli 1): 
IHC score  0: <=5%  
IHC score  1:  >5 and <=30%  
IHC score  2: >30%  and <=50%  
IHC score  3:  >50%  
 
Additionally,  baseline  and post-progression  Gli-1 expression  will be reported  (using  this provisional  
scoring  system) among  the patients  who have  an initial radiographic  response  and a post- 
progression  biopsy.  
 
The number  and grade  of toxicities  will be tabulated  using  NCI CTCAE  version  4, as well as the  
number of dose  reductions  in all cycles.  
 
The projected  accrual  rate is 1 to 2 patients  per month.

15.3 Randomization  
 
Not applicable.  There  is no randomization  in this study.  
 
16.1 DATA  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
A Research  Study  Assistant (RSA)  will be assigned  to the study.  The responsibilities  of the 
RSA include  project compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  
regulatory  monitoring, problem  resolution  and prioritization,  and coordinate  the activities  of 
the protocol  study  team.   The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  
database.   Source  documentation  will be available  to support the computerized  patient  
record.  
 
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient accruals  and completeness  
of registration  data.   Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data 
and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will 
be monitored  periodically  throughout the study  period  and potential problems  will be brought  
to the attention  of the study team for discussion  and action.  
 
 
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center  
were  approved  by the National  Cancer Institute  in September 2001.  The plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth by the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National Cancer  
Institute  for Data  and Safety Monitoring  of Clinical Trials”  which  can be  found  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by the Office  of Clinical Research.  The MSKCC  Data  and 
Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be  found  on the MSKCC  Intranet at:   
http://mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/_assets/_tables/content/359709/DSMPlans07.pdf  
 
There  are several  different mechanisms  by which  clinical trials  are monitored  for data, safety  
and quality.   There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits, therapeutic  response, and  staff 
education  on clinical research  QA) and  departmental  procedures  for quality  control, plus  
there  are two institutional committees  that are  responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical trials  programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for 
Page  31 of 37 
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB#: 14-211 A (7) 
APPROVED:  19 DEC  2016   
 Phase  I and II clinical trials,  and the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III 
clinical trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  developmen t and  review  process,  each  protocol  is assessed  for it’s level 
of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every type  of protocol (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in- 
house  sponsored, industrial sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group, etc.)  will be addressed  and 
the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
 
 
17.1 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
Potential risks  to human  subjects  include  drug related  toxicity,  pain and discomfort  
associated  with ribavirin  side effects  (Section  11), phlebotomy, and  possible  psychological  
discomfort  from the stresses  associated  with obtaining  imaging  studies  (eg, CT  scan), and  
possible  risks associated  with research  biopsy.   All efforts  will be made  to avoid  any 
complication  by completely  reviewing  patients’  symptoms,  providing  appropriate  
management, and  monitoring  blood  tests.  
 
If an adverse  medical event  occurs, the patient will first contact his/her study doctor,  a 
research  nurse, or the Principal  Investigator.  At nights  and on weekends, there  is an 
oncology  physician  on call at all times.  Patients  may either  call or come  directly  to the 
Urgent  Care  Center at Memorial Hospital  (or to their local emergency  room) to be seen.  
Patients  suffering  serious  adverse  reactions  must be carefully  followed  and all follow -up 
information  also recorded.  
 
Participation  in this trial is voluntary.   All patients  who participate  in the study must  provide  
written  informed  consent.  
 
The patient will be responsible  for all costs  related  to treatment and  complications  of 
treatment.  Costs  to the patient (third  party  insurer)  will include  the costs  hospitalizations,  
routine  blood  tests  and diagnostic  studies,  office  visits,  baseline  EKG,  and doctor’s  fees.  
Patients  will not be charged  for ribavirin  or any research  tests  performed  on research  
specimens  (research  biopsy,  immunohistochemistry).  
 
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use  and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form. The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by the Principal  
Investigator and  approved  by the IRB and Privacy  Board  (IRB/PB).  
 
17.3 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization  
Page  32 of 37 
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB#: 14-211 A (7) 
APPROVED:  19 DEC  2016   
 • A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal life  functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death, be life threatening, or 
require  hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  medical judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note : Hospital admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.   SAE reporting  is 
required  for 30-days  after the participant’s  last investigational treatment  or intervention.  Any 
events  that occur  after the  30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  
treatment must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  
Adverse  Events’,  the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar days  of the event.  
The IRB requires  a Clinical Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:  
 
 
Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to saegrade5@mskcc.org .  All other  
reports  should  be sent to sae@mskcc.org . 
 
The report should  contain  the following  information:  
Fields  populated  from CRDB:  
• Subject’s  initials  
• Medical record  number

18.1 INFORMED  CONSENT PROCEDURES  
 
Before  protocol -specified  procedures  are carried  out, consenting  professionals  will explain  full 
details  of the protocol  and study  procedures  as well as the  risks involved  to participants  prior 
to their inclusion  in the study. Participants  will also be informed  that they  are free to   
withdraw  from the study  at any time. All  participants must  sign an IRB/PB -approved  consent  
form indicating  their consent to participate. This  consent form meets  the requirements  of the 
Code  of Federal Regulations  and the Institutional  Review  Board/Privacy  Board  of this Center.  
The consent  form will include  the following:  
 
1. The nature  and objectives,  potential  risks and benefits  of the intended  study.  
2. The length  of study  and the likely  follow -up required.  
3. Alternatives  to the proposed  study. (This  will include  available  standard  and 
investigational  therapies. In addition, patients  will be offered  an option  of supportive  
care for therapeutic  studies.)  
4. The name  of the investigator(s) responsible  for the protocol.  
5. The right of the participant to accept or refuse  study  interventions/interactions  and to 
withdraw  from participation  at any time.  
 
Before  any protocol -specific  procedures  can be  carried  out, the consenting  professional will 
fully explain  the aspects  of patient  privacy concerning research  specific  information.  In 
addition  to signing  the IRB Informed  Consent, all  patients  must  agree  to the Research

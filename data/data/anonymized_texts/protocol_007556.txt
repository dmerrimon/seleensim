 Page 4 of 72 Projected Number of 
Sites:  Approximately 40 
Countries or Regions:  US only  
Expected Number of 
Subjects:  738 (enrolled)  
Rationale, Background, 
Risks and Benefits:  Bacterial vagi nosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection in women. 
Untreated BV may lead to higher risk of a sexually transmitted infection 
or pregnancy problems. Symptoms of BV may include unusual vaginal 
discharge, burning when urinating, itching around the outside of t he 
vagina, and vaginal irritation. Antibiotics are used to treat BV. 
Metronidazole was approved for use in the US in 1963 and is currently 
a first -line treatment for BV.   Gage Development Company, LLC is 
developing a drug product candidate that is designed  to be 
therapeutically equivalent to the marketed drug metronidazole 0.75% 
vaginal gel for the treatment of BV.  
The contraindications, warnings, precautions, drug interactions, and 
adverse events (AEs) associated with the use of metronidazole are 
described  in the approved product labeling for metronidazole 0.75% 
vaginal gel (Oceanside Pharmaceuticals).  
Study Design:  This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, 
bioequivalence clinical endpoint study evaluating the therapeutic 
equiva lence, safety, and tolerability of  GDC -229 (test product) , the 
reference product m etronidazole 0.75% vaginal gel (Oceanside 
Pharmaceuticals), and placebo (vehicle gel) in subjects with BV. The 
study is approximately 30 days  in duration and  is comprised of three 
study visits: Entry Visit (Visit 1; day of screening and randomization), 
Post-Treatment  Assessment  Visit ( Visit  2; 7 to 14 days after 
randomization) , and Test of Cure (Visit 3; 21 to 30 days after 
randomization) . 
At the Entry Visit (Visit 1), the fol lowing should be collected/assessed: 
review of all inclusion and exclusion criteria, demographic information, 
gynecological history , and medical history  (including concomitant 
medications used up to 30 days prior to screening), physical and pelvic 
examinat ion, vital signs, microbiological specimen collection for 
Nugent’s  score assessment and cervical infections (e.g., Chlamydia 
trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae ), urine drug screening, and urine 
pregnancy test.  
Diagnosis of BV will be determined based on Am sel’s c riteria , which 
requires presence of all four of the following: off -white (milky or gray), 
thin homogeneous discharge with minimal or absent pruritus and 
inflammation of the vulva and vagina; vaginal pH > 4.5; fishy odor 
upon a ddition of KOH to vagin al fluid (positive whiff test); and 
presence of clue cells on saline wet moun t greater than or equal to 20% 
of total epithelial cells on microscopic examination of the saline wet

 Page 5 of 72 mount. If the results of the Amsel ’s diagnosis exam  are positive  and the 
subject meets all other inclusion and exclusion criteria, the subject will 
be randomized to treatment.  Note: Nugent’s result is not used for 
randomization decisions . 
Eligible women will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive GDC -229 
(investigational m etronidazole 0.75 % vaginal gel), marketed 
metronidazole 0.75% vaginal gel (Oceanside Pharmaceuticals) or 
placebo. Subjects will be instructed to administer treatment 
intravaginally once daily at bedtime during Days 1 -5. 
At Post-Treatment Assessment  (Visit 2 ), 7 to 14 days after 
randomization  (Visit 1) , the following  procedures will be performed: 
pelvic examination,  and collection of study medication, subject -reported 
and Investigator -assessed local site reactions, AEs, and concomitant 
medications . At this visit, subjects wi ll be examined to assess for 
resolution of the following Amsel’s criteria: resolution of the abnormal 
vaginal discharge, negative KOH whiff test, and the presence of clue 
cells at less than 20 percent of the total epithelial cells on microscopic 
examinatio n of the saline wet mount ; in addition, the vaginal pH will be 
tested to assess if it has returned to the normal range of < 4.7 . 
The Test of Cure  (Visit 3) will be conducted  21 to 30 days after Visit  1 
to assess if the subject displays presence of normal v aginal discharge, 
absence of fishy odor using KOH whiff test, and less than 20% clue 
cells on microscopic examination of a wet saline wet mount; in 
addition, the vaginal pH will be tested to assess if it has returned to the 
normal range of < 4.7. At this v isit, the following procedures will be 
performed: a physical examination, including a pelvic exam to assess 
for the above Amsel’s criteria and for microbiological specimen 
collection for Nugent’s score assessment ; urine pregnancy test, subject -
reported and  Investigator -assessed local site reactions, and assessment 
of observed or subject -reported AEs and concomitant medications.  
Inclusion Criteria:  Subjects meeting all of the following criteria may be considered for 
study participation:   
1. Non-pregnant female  aged ≥ 18 years who is in good general 
health  
2. Diagnosis of BV, defined as presence of all of the following : 
a. Clinical diagnosis of BV (e.g., off-white [milky or

vagina ); AND  
b. Saline wet mount of vaginal discharge demonstrating 
the proportion of clue cells to be ≥  20% of the total 
epithelial cells ; AND  
c. Vaginal secretion pH > 4.5, using pH paper that

PROTOCOL GDC- 229-002 Version 01.00 Date: 23 January 2017 
 CONFIDENTIAL – PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
 
 Page 8 of 72  Urine pregnancy test at every site visit  
 Urine drug screen (Visit 1)  
 Medical a nd gynecological history (Visit 1)  
 Physical exam (Visits 1 and 3) and pelvic examinations (Visits 
1, 2, and 3)  
 Vital sign assessments including oral temperature, sitting blood 
pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate (Visits 1, 2, and 3) as 
well as weigh t (Visits  1 and 3)  
 AE and co ncomitant medications reporting (Visits 1, 2, and 3)  
 Local site reaction assessments ( subject -reported and 
Investigator -assessed at Visits 2 and 3)  
 Screening for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae  
(Visit 1)  
Efficacy E valuations:  Primary:  Clinical cure  defined as return to normal physiological 
discharge , negative whiff test, and the presence of clue cells at <20% of 
the total epithelial cells on microscopic examination of the saline wet 
mount  at Test of Cure ( Visit 3 ; Day 21 -30). 
Secondary: Bacteriological Cure defined as: Nugent’s score <4 at Visit 
3 (Day 21 -30).  Therapeutic cure defined as: having achieved c linical 
cure, vaginal pH of <4.7, and bacteriological cure.  
Other Assessments:  Demographic characteristics will be collected . 
Statistical Considerations:  The following assumptions were considered for the power and sample 
size assessment:  
 the proportion of participants in the test and reference  arms 
achieving a  clinical  cure is at least 36% and  within 4% of each 
other,  
 the proportion subjects receiving placebo that achieves clinical  
cure is 20% and  
 12.4% of randomized subjects do not qualify for the modified 
Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population,   
Based on the above assumptions 603  subjects will be  required.  
However , the previous studies that were used to estimate effect size had 
significant differences in study design and definition of primary 
endpoint.  Taking these differences into consideration, 738 subjects will 
be randomized  to achieve at least 90% power for su periority and 
bioequivalence . 
 
Analysis Datasets  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population :  All randomized subjects.  

PROTOCOL GDC- 229-002 Version 01.00 Date: 23 January 2017 
 CONFIDENTIAL – PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
 
 Page 9 of 72 Safety Population :  All randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose 
of study drug.  
Modified Intent -to-Treat ( mITT) Population:   All randomized sub jects 
excluding those who subsequently demonstrate a positive test result for 
other concomitant vaginal or cervical infections at baseline 
(e.g. C. trachomatis , N. gonorrhoeae ) which may interfere with the 
efficacy assessment for BV or who have a baseline Nugent score <4, 
received study treatment, and returned for at least one post -baseline 
visit. 
Per Protocol (PP) Population :  Includes all subjects who qualify for the 
mITT population and who follow important components of the trial 
(including subjects who a dhere to treatment and follow -up for efficacy 
within the prescribed timeframe ). 
Subjects  in the mITT population  who discontinue early from the study 
and do not have an assessment of clinical cure and bacteriological cure  
will be included in the mITT popula tion analyses  as treatment failures.  
These subjects without outcomes, but are classified as treatment failures 
will not be included in the PP analyses.  
To establish bioequivalence, the 90% confidence interval for the 
primary endpoint (the difference  [test-reference]  in proportion of 
subjects achieving a clinical cure) must be within [ -0.20, +0.20], using 
the PP population.  
As a parameter for determining adequate study sensitivity, the test 
product and the reference drug should both be statistically superior  to 
placebo (p<0.05, two -sided) for the primary endpoint, using the mITT 
study population . 
Duration of Treatment:  Subjects will be treated on Days 1 to 5 with Visit  2 to occur between 
Days 7 and 14 (inclusive).  
Test of Cure  (Visit 3) will occur between Da ys 21 and 30 (inclusive) 
after randomization to assess the primary and secondary endpoints . 
Study Duration:  Approximately eight months  for recruitment and completion of study 
subject participation.  
Compliance:  The trial will be carried out in accordance with Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) as required by the following: United States (US) Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) applicable to clinical studies (45 CFR Part 46, 21 
CFR Part s 50, 54, 56, 312, and 320), ICH E 6, and the 2013 revision of 
the Declaration of Helsinki .

OUND 
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection in women. The risk of plasma cell 
endometritis in women with BV has been reported to be 15 times higher than the risk in women 
without BV (Korn 1995 ). The presence of atypical c ells on a Pap smear is also more common in 
women with BV (Eltabbakh 1995 ). Untreated BV can lead to higher r isk of contracting a 
sexually transmitted infection (STI) or lead to pregnancy problems ( CDC Fact Sheet ). 
Symptoms of BV may include unusual va
ginal discharge, burning when urinating, itching around 
the outside of the vagina, and vaginal irritation. BV is typically diagnosed using Amsel’s criteria 
(Amsel 1983 ). The four Amsel’s criteria used to determine a clinical diagnosis of BV are as 
follows: vaginal pH > 4.5; positive “whiff” test (“fishy”
 odor); homogenous, nonviscous, off-
white (milky or gra y) discharge; and the presence of ≥ 20% clue cells. 
Oral and topical antibiotics are used to trea
t BV. Metronidazole was approved for use in the U.S. 
in 1963 and is currently a first-line tre
atment for BV ( Flagyl NDA ). Gage Development 
Company, 
LLC is developing a drug product candidate that is designed to be therapeutically 
equivalent to the marketed drug metronidazole 0.75% vaginal gel for the treatment of BV.

3.1 Description of Overal
l Study Design and Plan 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, bioequivalence clinical 
endpoint study to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence, safety, and tolerability of an experimental 
formulation of a metronidazole 0.75% vaginal g el (GDC -229; test product) and the reference 
product, metronidazole 0.75% vaginal g el (Oc
eanside Pharmaceuticals) in generally healthy 
adult subjects with BV. The study is 30 days in duration, including a 5-da
y treatment period. 
There are three study visits as shown in Table 1: Entry Visit (Visit 1, day of screening and 
randomization); P
ost-Treatment Assessment (Visit 2, 7 to 14 days after rand
omization), and Test 
of Cure (Visit 3, 21 to 30 days after randomization). Including a re
cruitment period of seven 
months, the total study duration is approximately eight months.

Visit 1  Screening and R andomization  Day 1  
Visit 2  Post-Treatment Assessment  Day 7 -14 (inclusive)  
Visit 3  Test of Cure  Day 21 to 30 (inclusive)  
It is expected that approximately 738 subject s will be enrolled in this study and randomized into 
one of three treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio (246 subjects/group). One o
f three study treatments 
(metronidazole 0.75% vaginal gel [GDC-229; test article], marketed metron
idazole 0.75% 
vaginal gel [Oceanside Pharmaceuticals], or matched placebo [i.e., GDC-
229 vehicle]) will be 
administrated intravaginally once daily at bedtime for 5 consecutive days. 
3.2 Study Design Rationale 
The study design outlined in this protocol is prim
arily based on the April 2013 Food & Drug 
Administration (FDA) draft guidance for the development of generic metronidazole vaginal gel, 
0.75%, equivalent to the reference listed drug Metrogel-Vaginal (NDA 020208). This guidance 
describes the eligibility criteria for subjects (including Amsel’s c
riteria, which are defined in 
inclusion criteria ; Section 3.3.1) , microbiological confirmation of disease, efficacy endpoints, 
safety consi
derations, and recommendations for statistical analyses. A placebo arm is included to 
demonstrate adequate study sensitivity. The dose selection and dosing regimen is based on the 
FDA approved dose.  
Safety considerations specific to the use of metron
idazole are described in Section 8.2. 
3.3 Selection of Subjects  
Approximately 738 generally he
althy adult female subjects with a diagnosis of BV based on all 
four Amsel’s criteria will be recruited from approximately 40 research centers in the United 
States (US). Specific entry criteria are detailed in Section 3.3.1
 and Section 3.3.2.

 Page 19 of 72 3.4 Withdrawal of Subjects 
Subjects may withdraw from the study a
t any time or be withdrawn from the study at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effects occur. In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by the investigator or the sponsor if she deviated from the protocol or for other safety 
reasons. 
Subjects withdrawing from the study will not be replaced, rega
rdless of the reason for 
discontinuation. All reasonable efforts should be made to contact the subject if she decides to 
discontinue study treatment. 
The procedures noted in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 
3) should be performed for the 
Early Termination Visit, whenever it occurs. A subject will be considered to have completed the 
study after completing the Test of Cure Visit (Visit 3). If a subject is discontinued at any time 
after entering the study, the investigator will make every eff
ort to see the subject and complete 
the early discontinuation assessments as shown in Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3)  and 
Section 5.4. 
A termination electronic case report form (eCRF ) page should be included for
 each subject who 
receives study medication, whether or not the subject completes the study. The reason for any 
early discontinuation should be indicated on the form. The primary reason for a subject 
withdrawing prematurely should be selected from the list provided in Se
ction 6.2.  
3.5 Study Treatments 
3.5.1 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatmen
ts 
Subjects will be assigned a unique subject identification number during Screening. Following 
completion of the screening procedures, eligible subjects will be randomi
zed in a blinded manner 
to one of three treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. It is anticipated that approximately 246 subjects 
will be randomized to each treatment. The identity and description of study drugs are described 
in the subsections that follow. 
3.5.2 Identity of Study Drug and Treatme
nts Administered 
All drug supplies will be provided by the Sponsor . Basic information about the study drug 
supplies is provided in  Table 2.

 Page 21 of 72 3.5.3.2 Warnings 
3.5.3.2.1 Convulsive Seizures and
 Peripheral Neuropathy 
Convulsive seizures and peripheral neuropathy, the latter characterized mainly by numbness or 
paresthesia of an extremity, have been reported in patients treated with oral or intravenous 
metronidazole. The appearance of abnormal neurologic signs demands the prompt 
discontinuation of metronidazole vaginal gel therapy. Metronidazole vaginal gel should be 
administered with caution to patients with CNS diseases. 
3.5.3.2.2 Psychotic Reactions 
Psyc
hotic reactions have been reported in alcoholic patients who were using oral metronidazole 
and disulfiram concurrently. Metronidazole vaginal gel should not be administered to patients 
who have taken disulfiram within the last two weeks. 
3.5.3.3 Precautions 
Metronidazole vaginal gel results in minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure (AUCs) 
of metronidazole compared to 500 mg oral metronidazole dosing. Although these lower levels of 
exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral metronidazole, the 
possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded presently. Data from well-controlled 
trials directly comparing metronidazole administered orally to metronidazole administered 
vaginally are not available. 
3.5.3.3.1 General 
Patients with severe hepatic disease metabolize metronidazole slowly. This results in the 
accumulation of metronidazole and its metabolites in the plasma. Accordingly, for such patients, 
metronidazole vaginal gel should be administered cautiously. 
Known or previously unrecognized vaginal candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms 
during therapy with metronidazole vaginal gel. Approximately 6-10% of patients treated with 
metronidazole vaginal gel developed symptomatic Candida va
ginitis during or immediately after 
therapy. 
Disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol has been reported with oral metronidazole, thus the 
possibility of such a reaction occurring while on metronidazole vaginal gel therapy cannot be 
excluded. 
Metronidazole vaginal gel contains ingredients that may cause burning and irritation of the eye. 
In the event of accidental contact with the eye, rinse the eye with copious amounts of cool tap 
water. 
3.5.3.3.1.1 Information for the Patient: 
The patient should be cautioned about drinking alcohol while being treated with metronidazole 
vaginal gel. While blood levels are significantly lower with Metronidazole Vaginal Gel than with 
usual doses of oral metronidazole, a possible interaction with alcohol ca
nnot be excluded. 

PROTOCOL GDC- 229-002 Version 01.00 Date: 23 January 2017 
 CONFIDENTIAL – PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
 
 Page 22 of 72 The patient should be instructed not to engage in va
ginal intercourse during treatment with this 
product (in addition, the protocol requires that the subject not engage in vaginal intercourse for 
the two days following treatment or for 48 hours prior to Vis
its 2 and 3). 
3.5.3.3.1.2 Drug Interactions 
Oral metronidaz
ole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other 
coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. This possible drug 
interaction should be considered when metronidazole vaginal gel is prescribed for patients on 
this type of anticoagulant therapy. 
In patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium, short-term oral metronidazole therapy 
has been associated with elevation of serum lithium levels and, in a few cases, signs of lithium 
toxicity. 
Use of cimetidine with oral metronidazole may prolong the half-life and decrease plasma 
clearance of metronidazole. 
3.5.3.3.1.3 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions 
Metronidazole may interfere with certain types of determinations of serum chemistry values, 
such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides, and glucose hexokinase. Values of zero may be 
observed. All of the assays in which interference 
has been reported involve enzymatic coupling 
of the assay to oxidation-reduction of nicotinamide-a
denine dinucleotides (NAD + NADH). 
Interference is due to the similarity in absorbance peaks of NADH (340 nm) and metronidazole 
(322 nm) at pH 7. 
3.5.3.3.1.4 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Im
pairment of Fertility 
Metronidazole has shown evidence of carcinogenic activity in a number of studies involving 
chronic oral administration in mice and rats. Prominent among the effects in the mouse was the 
promotion of pulmonary tumorigenesis. This has been observed in all six reported studies in that 
species, including one study in which the animals were dosed on an intermittent schedule 
(administration during every fourth w
eek only). At very high dose levels (approximately 
500 mg/kg/day), there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of malignant liver 
tumors in males. Also, the published results of one of the mouse
 studies indicate an increase in 
the incidence of malignant lymphomas as we
ll as pulmonary neoplasms associated with lifetime 
feeding of the drug. All these effects are statistically significant. Several long-term oral dosing 
studies in the rat have been completed. There were statistically significant increases in the 
incidence of various neoplasms, particularly in mammary and hepatic tumors, among female rats 
administered metronidazole over those noted in the concurrent female control groups. Two 
lifetime tumorigenicity studies in hamsters have been performed and reported to be negative. 
These studies have not been conducted with 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel, which would 
result in significantly lower systemic blood levels than those obtained with oral formulations. 
Although metronidazole has shown mutagenic activity in a number of in vitro assay systems, 
studies in mammals (in vivo) have failed to demonstrate a potential for genetic damage.

 Page 23 of 72 Fertility studies have been perf
ormed in mice up to six times the recommended human oral dose 
(based on mg/m2) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility. 
3.5.3.3.1.5 Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects 
Pregnancy Category B 
There has been no experience to date with the use of Metronidazole Vaginal Gel in pregnant 
patients. 
Metronidazole crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation rapidly. No 
fetotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed when metronidazole was administered orally to 
pregnant mice at six times the recommended human dose (based on mg/m2); however, in a single 
small study where the drug was administered intraperitoneally, some intrauterine deaths were 
observed. The relationship of these findings to the drug is unknown. There are, however, no 
adequate and well-controlled studie
s in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies 
are not always predictive of human response, and because metronidazole is a carcinogen in 
rodents, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. 
Nursing Mothers 
Specific studies of metronidazole levels in human milk following intravaginally administered 
metronidazole have not been performed. However, metronidazole is secreted in human milk in 
concentrations similar to those found in plasma following oral administration of metronidazole. 
Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for metronidazole in mouse and rat studies, a 
decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into 
account the importance of the drug to the mother. 
Pediatric Use 
Safety and effectivene
ss in children have not been established. 
3.5.3.4 Adverse Ev ents 
3.5.3.4.1 Clinical Trials 
There were no deaths or serious adverse events related to drug therapy in clinical trials involving 
800 non-pregnant women who received metronidazole vaginal gel. 
In a randomized, single-blind clinical trial of 505 non-pregnant women who received 
metronidazole vaginal gel once or twice a day, 2 patients (one from each regimen) discontinued 
therapy early due to drug-related adverse events. One patient discontinued drug because of 
moderate abdominal cramping and loose stools, 
while the other patient discontinued drug 
because of mild vaginal burning. These symptoms resolved after discontinuation of drug. 
Medical events judged to be related, probably
 related, or possibly related to administration of 
metronidazole vaginal gel once or twice a day were reported for 195/505 (39%) patients. The 
incidence of individual adverse reactions were not significantly different between the two 
regimens. 
Unless percentages are otherwise stipulated, the incidence of individual adverse reactions listed 
below was less than 1%:

This is a double-blind study. Every effort will be made to ensure that the investigator and 
subjects will be blinded to study treatment for the durati
on of the study. 
If the treatment assignment must be revealed for the safety of the subject or to treat an AE, the 
investigator will contact the medical monitor. A decision to break the blind must be reached by 
the medical monitor or designee and the investi
gator. 
The investigator or designee may break the blind independent of the medical monitor only if it is 
considered an emergency by the investigator. If this occurs, the medical monitor and the sponsor 
must be notified within 48 hours of breaking the blind. The event requiring breaking the blind 
must be documented in the eCRF, including the date the
 blind was broken. In addition, the 
subject will be discontinued from further study drug administration in this study. 
3.5.9 Treatment Compliance 
Subjects will be required to return unused study medication and unused applicators and subject 
compliance information will be captured. Th
e sites will record return of study medication and 
supplies in the subject source documentation and eCRF and will retain all returned tubes and 
unused applicators for verification by the clinical monitor prior to return of study medication to 
the depot. Compliance will be assessed based on the subj
ect’s verbal agreement on doses given 
and absence of unused applicators.

 Erosion/ulcera
tion 
 Edema 
The
 subject will be queried by
 the 
Investigator or designee for presence of the following and, if 
present, the subject will be asked to rate as described above: 
 Burning/stinging  
 Pain  
 Pruritus (itching)  
Local site rea
ctions will be
 collected independently of AEs and will include any reaction that 
occurs within the treatment area.  Local site reactions that require medical intervention (e.g., 
prescription medication) or extend beyond the treatment area should be documented as an AE. 
4.8 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
4.8.1 Urine Drug Screening 
At the Entry Visit (Visit 1), urine drug screening will be completed. 
4.8.2 Pregnancy Testing 
Pregn
ancy testing via urine hCG testing (serum hCG testing will be done only if deemed 
necessary by  the PI) will be performed for each subject, regardless of childbearing potential, at 
each visit. Additional pregnancy
 testing may also be performed if there is any suspicion or 
clinical concern that a woman might be pregnant at an
y time during the study. 
4.8.3 Screening for Sexually Transmitted Infections 
At the Entry Visit (Visit 1) pelvic examination, a sample will be collected for assessment of 
sexually transmitted infections (STI) for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae . 
4.8.4 Microbiological Sample 
A wet smear microbiological sample will be collected at each visit in order to determine if 
Amsel ’s criteria are met/or resolved.  Evidence of any vulvovaginitis other than BV. 
(e.g., vulvovaginal candidiasis, Trichomonas vaginal
is, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae
, active Herpes simplex, or active HPV will also be ruled out in order to ensure 
study eligibility.  In addition, a specimen for Gram stain will be collected at Visits 1 and 3.

decision to randomize is made; Nugent’s result
 is not used for randomization decisions). 
If the results of the Amsel’s screening tests are positive and the subject is eligible 
according to all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, the subject can be randomized to 
treatment: 
o Clinical diagnosis of BV (e.g., thin, homogeneous off-white [milky or grayish] 
vaginal discharge associated with minimal or absent pruritus inflammation); AND 
o Saline wet mount of vaginal discharge demonstrating the proportion of clue cells to 
be ≥ 20% of the total epithelial cells; AND

 Page 34 of 72 6 END OF STUDY CRITERIA
 
At the end of each subject’s participation in the study, the investigator will complete an End of 
Study form for all completed and discontinued subjects. 
6.1 Completion of the Study 
Subjects who complete the 5-day treatment and all of the evaluations at the Assessment of 
Clinical Cure Visit (Visit 3) will be considered to have completed the study. 
6.2 Subject Discontinuation 
A subject m
ay be withdrawn from the study prior to completion for any of the following reasons: 
 AEs 
 Abnormal laboratory values 
 De
ath 
 Lack of effica
cy 
 L
ost to follow-up 
 Noncompliance with stu
dy drug 
 P
hysician decision 
 Preg
nancy (if applic
able) 
 Protocol deviation 
 Study terminated b
y Sponsor 
 Withdrawal by subject; NOTE: 
 if the subject decides to withdraw from the study due to 
an AE then it should be classified as withdrawal due to an AE.
 
 Other (e.g., any reason that may affect the outcome of the study or safety of subjects) 
If a subject withdr
aws prematurely for any reason, the site should make every effort to have the 
subject return for her next scheduled visit to perform all required visit activities and to collect 
and reconcile all test article. If the subject is discontinued prior to the Assessment of Clinical 
Cure Visit (Visit 3; Day 21 to 30), the site should complete the End of Study eCRFs during the 
last visit that the subject will complete. Subjects who withdraw prematurely
 will not be replaced. 
When a subject is withdrawn from the study for a treatment-related AE (i.e., as defined in 
Section 8.1.2), when possible, the subject should be followed until resolution or stabilization of 
the AE. If a subject is discontinue
d from the study due to pregnancy, the pregnancy and its 
outcome should be followed (see Section 8.1.5 ).

 Page 35 of 72 6.3 Study Termination 
The study may
 be terminated by the Sponsor. If, in the opinion of the investigator, clinical 
observations made during the study suggest that it may be unwise to continue, he or she may 
discontinue his or her participation in the study.   
If an investigator decides to terminate his or her p
articipation, a written statement fully 
documenting the reasons for this action will be submitted to the Sponsor by the investigator 
within five working days. 
In the event that the Sponsor chooses to discontinue or terminate the study, appropriate 
notification will be given to the investigator.

 Page 36 of 72 7 EVALUATIONS 
7.1 Efficacy Parameters
 
The primary efficacy endpoint (Clinical Cure) is  the resolution o f the following three abnormal 
BV signs included in Amsel’s criteria
: return to normal physiological vaginal discharge as 
determined by the investigator, negative whiff test
, and the presence of clue cells at <20% of the 
total epithelial cells on microscopic examination of the saline wet mount.  
The supportive secondary efficacy endpoints are the Bacteriological Cure and the Therapeutic 
Cure.  The bacteriological cure is defined as Nu
gent’s score <4 (via Gram stain central 
laboratory analysis). A Nugent score ≥4 is
 considered abnormal and represents an imbalance in 
vaginal flora that permits BV to manifest ( Nugent 1991 ). Subjects who a
re responders are 
expected to achieve a normal Nugent score (i.e., 0 to 3) following treatment. 
Therapeutic cure is defined as having achieved c linical cure, vaginal pH of <4.7, and 
bacteriological cure (i.e., Nugent score of < 4 at Visit 3). 
7.2 Safety Evaluation 
Each subject’s health status will be monitored carefully throughout the study. Baseline data 
collected will consist of the medical and gynecological history and physical examination 
findings, including pelvic examinations (to include STI screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea). 
Vital signs include oral temperature, sitting blood pressure, h
eart rate, and respiratory rate. Blood 
pressure will be collected after sitting for 5 to 10 minutes and should be taken from the same arm 
at each visit. 
Weight will be recorded at the Entry Visit (Visit 1) and the Assessment of Continued Clinical 
Cure Visit (Visit 3). 
Subjects who withdraw from the study will have
 all safety assessments repeated except for urine 
drug and STI testing, if the subject allows. 
At every visit or contact, subjects will be questioned about how they have been feeling and any 
symptoms they have experienced. Interviews with subjects will include a review of any AE 
reported in order to obtain as much information as possible (e .g., onset date, dura
tion, intensity). 
The AEs will be recorded at each visit in the medical reco
rds and the e CRF . See Section 8.1 for 
AE definitions and criteria, including assessments for intensity
 and re
latedness.  In addition, 
local site reactions based on investigator examination and subject self-report will assessed at 
Visits 2 and 3. 
The principal investigator (or designated medical designee
) will review each AE, assess severity 
and causality and will report it in accordance with established procedures (see Section 8.1.1.4 ). 
There will be strict adherenc e to SAE reporting (se
e Section 8.1.3.2 ). 
7.3 Appropriateness of Measurements 
As state
d in Section 3.2, the study design relied heavily on the recommendations provided in 
FDA draft guidances. 

PROTOCOL GDC- 229-002 Version 01.00 Date: 23 January 2017 
 CONFIDENTIAL – PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
 
 Page 37 of 72 8 SAFETY 
The primary method of assessing safe
ty will be collection and analysis of AEs. AEs and SAEs 
will be carefully monitored throughout this study.
 
8.1 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
8.1.1 Definitions and Criteria 
8.1.1.1 Adverse Events (AEs) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered related. An AE c
an therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding
), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product. 
Suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
An adverse reaction is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected 
adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. For the 
purposes of prescription drug labeling, the term adverse reaction is defined to mean “an 
undesirable effect, reasonably associated with the use of a drug that may occur as part of the 
pharmacological action or may be unpredictable in its occurrence. This definition does not 
include all AEs observed during use of a drug, only those AEs for which there is some basis to 
believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the AE”. 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the RLD 
package insert or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. For example, 
under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the 
RLD package insert referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral 
thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) 
if the RLD package insert listed only cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this 
definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the RLD 
package insert as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug 
under investigation. 
Timely and complete reporting of all AEs assists  in identifying any 
untoward medical occurrence, thereby allowing:  
1) protection of the safety of study subjects;  
2) a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the test article;  
3) recognition of dose-related test article toxicity; 
4) appropriate modification of study protocols ;  
5) improvements in study design or procedures; and  

PROTOCOL GDC- 229-002 Version 01.00 Date: 23 January 2017 
 CONFIDENTIAL – PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
 
 Page 38 of 72 6) adherence to worldwide regulatory 
requirements. 
Any adverse change from the study participant’s baseline condition that occurs following the 
first administration of study product is an AE. This includes the occurrence of a new AE or the 
worsening of a baseline condit
ion, whether or not considered related to the study product. A Es 
include but are not limited to: adverse changes in the general condition of the study participant; 
signs and symptoms noted by the study participant or her caregiver; concomitant disease with 
onset or increased severity after the start of study product administration and clinically 
meaningful adverse changes in laboratory safety parameters occurring after the start of study 
product administration. Day- to-day fluctuations in pre-existing condit ions that represent a 
clinically significant change in the participant’s status should be reported as AEs. 
8.1.1.2 Local Site Reactions 
Investigator or designee will assess treatment area and rate on a scale of 0 = absent, 1 = mild 
(slight, barely perceptible), 2 = moderate (distinct presence), and 3 = severe (marked, intense) 
the following at Visits 2 and 3:  
 Erythema 
 Petechiae 
 Erosion/ulcerati
on 
 Edema 
The
 subject will be queried by
 the 
Investigator or designee for presence of the following and, if 
present, the subject will be asked to rate as described above: 
 Burning/stinging  
 Pain  
 Pruritus (itching)  
Loca
l site rea
ctions will be colle
cted independently of AEs and will include any reaction that 
occurs within the treatment area.  Local site reactions that require medical intervention (e.g., 
prescription medication) or extend beyond the treatment area should be documented as an AE. 
8.1.1.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it meets the 
criteria for any
 of the following outcomes: 
1. Death. 
2. Life-threatening. This term refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an e
vent that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe. 
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. In general, 
hospitalization signifies that the partic
ipant has been admitted (usually involving at leas t 
an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that 
would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. 

PROTOCOL GDC- 229-002 Version 01.00 Date: 23 January 2017 
 CONFIDENTIAL – PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
 
 Page 39 of 72 Complications that occur during hospitalization a
re AEs or SAEs as defined above. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment or procedures of a 
pre-existing condition that did not worsen from b
aseline is not considered an AE. 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. The term disability means a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability
 to conduct normal life functions. This 
definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance 
such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental 
trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but 
do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Medical or scientific judgment should be exerc
ised in deciding whether (expedited) reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above 
definition. These medically important events should also be considered SAEs. Examples of 
medically important events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that result in hospitalizations; or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
In addition, cancer and drug overdose are included in  classification of an SAE. 
8.1.1.4 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions 
All AEs should be reported, whether or not they are considered to be related to the treatment. 
The report of AEs should include date of onset, description of the AE, severity, relation to study 
medication, action taken, outcome, and date of resolution. This information is needed to 
determine if the incidence and severity of adverse reactions is different between the test articles. 
8.1.2 Assessing Intensity and Relationship of Adverse Events 
8.1.2.1 Intensity 
The intensity of the AE
 will be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe using the following 
criteria: 
 Mild:  Subject was aware of the event, but wa s still able to do all activities 
 Moderate:  Subject had t
o discontinue some activities due to the event 
 Severe:  Subject was incapacitated by the event and unable to perform normal activities 
8.1.2.2 Relationship to Study Dr
ug 
The site investigator is responsible for assessing the relationship between the AE and the study 
product. The investigator must determine whether
 there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
product caused or contributed to an AE. The relationship a
ssessment, based on clinical judgment, 
often relies on the following: 
 A temporal relationship between the event and administration of study product 

PROTOCOL GDC- 229-002 Version 01.00 Date: 23 January 2017 
 CONFIDENTIAL – PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
 
 Page 40 of 72  A plausible biological mechanism for the study product to cause the AE 
 Another possible etiology of the AE 
 Previous report of similar AEs associate
d with the study product or other agents in the 
same class 
The terms used to assess the relationship of an AE to st
udy drug are included in  Table 4. 
Table 4 Assessment of Causality and Relationship to Study Drug 
Causality 
Assessment  Criteria for Assessment (note that re -challenge will not be done in this 
study)  
Related  The experience occurs immediately following study  drug administration, 
related pharmacologically (not related to underlying condition/concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals) and follows a known response pattern to 
the study drug.  
Possibly Related  The experience follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration and/or follows a known response p attern to the trial drug but 
could have been produced by other factors such as the participant’s clinical 
state, therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy .  
Not Related  There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study produc t; 
when an AE is assessed as not related to the study product, an alternative 
etiology, diagnosis or explanation for the AE should be documented . If new 
information becomes available, the relationship of any AE should be reviewed 
again and updated, as requ ired. 
8.1.3 Reporting Procedures and Requirements for Adverse Events 
8.1.3.1 Study Reporting Period for Adverse Events 
At every visit or contact, study staff will ask each participant how she felt since her last visit and 
indirectly ask if she has experienced any AEs. 
The reporting period for AEs is the period immediately following the signing of the ICF through 
30 days after last use of study product.
 
For the purposes of study analysis, if a non-serious AE has not resolved at the end of the study-
reporting period it will be reported as still ong
oing in the EDC system. However, the investigator 
must make every reasonable effort to follow the event to resolution or stabilization and report to 
. 
SAEs must be followed until resolution. Resolution of an SAE is defined as the return to baseline 
status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic. 
8.1.3.2 Recording of Adverse Events 
AEs will be reported in the EDC system using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that 
accurately reflects the e
vent. Information recorded in the EDC system must be substantiated in 
the source documents. All AEs must be recorded in the participant’s source documents and must 
include the following information (when applicable)
: 

PROTOCOL GDC- 229-002 Version 01.00 Date: 23 January 2017 
 CONFIDENTIAL – PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
 
 Page 41 of 72  Specific condition or even t. 
 Possible etiologies and whether the event meets criteria as an SAE and therefore requires 
immediate notification to the sponsor. (See Sec
tion 8.1.1.3  for the definition of SAEs.) 
 Indication of whether the condition was preexisting prior to study entry or not and if yes, 
whether it has worsened in severity or fre
quency, in which case it is reported as an AE. 
Conditions present prior to study entry that do not worsen in severity are not considered 
AEs. 
 Date of occurrence. 
 Date of resolution. If the event has not resolved at the end of the study-reporting period, it 
will be reported as still present in the EDC sy
stem. 
 AEs that change in intensity are recorded at the most severe intensity level that is 
reported by the participant. 
 Relations
hip to study product as evaluated by the investigator (causality assessment). 
 Action taken with the study product per the inve
stigator medical judgment (study product 
interrupted, discontinued or none) and outcome. 
 Seriousness: An SAE, in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 (a), means “any adverse event 
occurring at any dose that results in any of th
e following outcomes: death, a life 
threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.” In addition, cancer and drug overdose are included in 
 classification of an SAE
. 
8.1.3.3 Notification to Sponsor of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs will be reported promptly in accordance with the FDA regulations and recorded on the 
appropriate forms. 
WHEN ANY SAE, REGARDLESS 
OF RELATIONSHIP
 TO THE STUDY PRODUCT, IS 
ENCOUNTERED DURING THIS CLINICAL TRIAL AT AN INVESTIGATOR’S SITE, 
THE INVESTIGATOR, IN ACCORDANCE WITH 21 CFR 312.64(b), MUST NOTIFY 
 WITHIN 24 HOURS OF IDENTIFICATION/AWARENESS OF 
THE SAE BY REPORTING THE EVENT VIA THE EDC SYSTEM AND VIA THE SAE 
REPORTING FORM FOR THIS STUDY. SAE S
UBMISSION SHOULD BE 
COMPLETED FOR ANY SAE THAT IS EXPERIENCED AFTER THE SUBJECT HAS 
SIGNED THE I CF, EVEN IF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT HAS NOT YET BE 
ADMINISTERED.

 Page 43 of 72 8.1.3.5 Reconciliation of Safety Data
 
All safety data will be reviewed throughout the study and information submitted on SAE report 
forms will be reconciled with data colle
cted via the EDC system. Each SAE must have a 
corresponding AE recorded in the study database. Subject source documents will be reviewed 
during site audits and study monitoring visits to determine if there are any unreported AEs. 
8.1.4 Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
If an abnormal laboratory 
result indicated as clinically significant by the investigator is the 
reason for a subject being withdrawn from the study or requires treatment for the abnormality, 
this abnormal result must also be reported as an AE. In addition, any laboratory test result that 
meets the criteria for an SAE (see Section 8.1.1.3 ) must also be reported as an SAE so  
 can collect additional information about that abnormality, including information 
regarding relationship to test article or other ca
uses, any action taken, and outcome. 
8.1.5 Pregnancy 
Women of childbearing potential include an
y female who has experienced menarche or is 18 
years of age or older and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, 
bilateral tubal ligation [at least six months prior to initiation of treatment], or bilateral 
oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea >12 consecutive months in 
women 50 years of age and older). Even women who are using one of the effective forms of 
birth control per protocol will be considered of childbearin
g potential. 
Women of childbearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test prior to study enrollment and 
must use an effective method of birth control during the 
course of the study, in a manner such 
that risk of failure is minimized. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential must 
be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnan
cy during the study and the potential risk 
factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The subject must sign an ICF documenting this 
discussion. 
Women of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if 
they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) . If a subject or 
investigator suspects that a subject may be pre
gnant at any time during the study, the test article 
must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is 
confirmed, the subject must not receive or apply further test article and must be discontinued 
from the study. 
If following initiation of study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a study subject was 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of test article exposure, the investigator must 
immediately notify the Medical Monitor of this event, and record the pregnancy on the 
appropriate pregnancy surveillance form. The form will be sent to . The 
investigator must notify the IRB of any pregnancy associated with the study therapy and keep 
careful source documentation of the event. 
Protocol-required procedures for those subjects that are discontinued from the study must be 
performed on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (e.g., x-ray studies). Other 
appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated, including 

PROTOCOL GDC- 229-002 Version 01.00 Date: 23 January 2017 
 CONFIDENTIAL – PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
 
 Page 44 of 72 counseling of the subject by the investi
gator and her managing physician or health care provider 
(e.g., obstetrician). In addition, the investigator must report to , on the 
appropriate  pregnancy surveillance form(s), any follow-up information 
regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Although 
pregnancy itself is not an AE, any complications during pregnancy should be recorded as AEs or 
SAEs (if they fulfill the SAE criteria)
. Offspring should be followed for a minimum of eight 
weeks. Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a subject exposed to the test 
article(s) should be recorded as a SAE and de
tails documented in the pregnancy surveillance 
form. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be reported as a SAE. 
8.2 Other Safety Concerns 
The Contraindications, Warnings, Precautions, Drug Interactions, and Adverse Reactions 
associated with the use of metronidazole are descr
ibed in the approved product labeling for 
metronidazole 0.75% vaginal gel (Oceanside Pharmaceutical). A brief summary of each is 
described Section 3.5.3 .

 Page 45 of 72 9 STATISTICAL AND ANALY
TICAL METHODS  
The statistical analysis will be conducted by  in collaboration with Gage 
Development Company, LLC 
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be finalized before the code for all subjects is broken and 
prior to locking the database to expand upon the statistical methods presented below. Any 
deviations from the analysis described below will 
be included in the SAP, which will be included 
in Appendix 16.1.9 of the clinical study report. 
All baseline and efficacy data will be summa
rized and analyzed by treatment. 
9.1 Sample Size 
Assuming the test and reference clinical cure rates are within 4% of each other, the placebo 
clinical cure rate is 20%, the test and reference clinical cure rates are at least 36% and 12.4% of 
randomized subjects do not qualify for the modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT) population, then 603 
subjects will be required to achieve at least 90% power for superiority and bioequivalence 
(Schwebke 2015; Chavoustie 2015 ). However, the previous studies that were used to estimate 
effect size had significant differences in study design and definition of primary endpoint.  Taking 
these differences into consideration, 738 subjects will be randomized.  The assumption of a 36% 
test and reference clinical cure r
ate was derived after review of the FDA statistical review of 
Metronidazole vaginal gel 1.3% ( Center for Drug Evaluation and Research 2014 ). 
9.2 Analysis Populations 
The following subject populations will be created: 
 Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Population:  All randomized subjects. 
 Safety Population:  All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. 
 Modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT) Population:  All randomized subjects excluding those 
who subsequently demonstrate a positive test result for other concomitant vaginal or 
cervical infections at baseline (e.g. C trachomatis , N. gonorrhoeae ) which may interfere 
with the efficacy assessment for BV or who have a baseline Nugent score < 4. 
 Per Protocol (PP) Population:  Includes all subjects who qualify for the mITT population 
and who follow important components of the trial (including subjects who adhere to 
treatment and follow-up for efficacy within the prescribed timeframe). 
Subjects in the MITT population who discontinue early from the study and do not have an 
assessment of clinical cure and bacteriologica
l cure will be included in the mITT population 
analyses as treatment failures. These subjects without outcomes, but are classified as treatment 
failures will not be included in the PP analy
ses.  
To establish bioequivalence, the 90% confidence interval for the primary endpoint (the 
difference in the proportion of subjects achieving a clinical cure between m etronidazole 0.75% 
vaginal gel  (GDC -229; test product) and metronidazole 0.75% vaginal gel (Oceanside 
Pharmaceutica
ls) must be within [0.20, +0.20] for dichotomous variables, using the PP 
population.

 Page 46 of 72 9.3 Disposition of Sub
jects 
The number of subjects who are enrolled and treated and complete the clinical trial will be 
tabulated. A disposition graph of subjects will be provided. 
9.4 Demographic and Other Subject Characteristics 
Subject demographics and pre-admission characteristics will be summarized descriptively. 
9.5 Extent of Exposure 
Exposure to study product will be summarized by the number of doses used and length of time 
over which the product is used. 
9.6 Efficacy Analyses 
9.6.1 Primary Endpoints 
The primary endpoint is the clinical cure at the Test of Cure Visit (Visit 3) and includes the 
following: 
 Resolution of the abnormal vaginal discharge to a normal physiologic discharge 
 Negative whiff test 
 Prese
nce of clue cells a
t < 20% of the total epithelial cells on microscopic examination of 
the saline wet mount 
The mITT population will be
 used to compare both the test and reference products to placebo. 
The PP population will be used to evaluate bioequivalence between the test and reference 
products. 
To assess adequate study sensitivity the test and references products need to be statistically 
superior (p<0.05, 2-sided) to placebo using the mITT population. 
To establish bioequivalence, the 90% confidence interval for the primary endpoint (the 
difference [test-reference] in clinical cure rate) must be within [-0.20, +0.20], using the PP 
population. 
9.6.2 Secondary Endpoints
 
Secondary endpoints include the following as assessed at the Test of Cure (Visit 3): 
 Nugent score of < 4  
 Responder outcome (
therapeutic cure) defined as follows: 
o Clinical cure as defined in the Primary Endpoint 
o Vaginal pH < 4.7  
o Nugent score of < 4 (i.e., bacteriological cure) 
9.7 Safety P
arameters 
All safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Population.

---------- 
Metronidazole Vaginal Gel, 0.75% 
FOR INTRAVAGINAL USE ONLY 
NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC, DERMAL, OR ORAL USE 
DESCRIPTION 
Metronidazole Vaginal Gel is the intravaginal dosage form of the synthetic antibacterial agent, 
metronidazole, USP at a concentration of 0.75%. Metronidazole is a member of the imidazole 
class of antibacterial agents and is classified therapeutically as an antiprotozoal and antibacterial 
agent. Chemically, metronidazole is a 2-
methyl-5-nitroimidazole-1-ethanol. It has a chemical 
formula of C 6H9N3O3, a molecular weight of 171.16, and has the following structure: 
 
 
 
 
Metronidazole Vaginal Gel is a gelled, purified water solution, containing metronidazole at a 
concentration of 7.5 mg/g (0.75%). The gel is formulated at pH 4.0. The gel also contains 
carbomer 934P, edetate disodium, methylparaben, propylparaben, propylene glycol, and sodium 
hydroxide.  
 
Each applicator full of 5 gr
ams of vaginal gel contains approximately 37.5 mg of metronidazole. 
 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
 
Normal Subjects: 
Following a single, intravaginal 5 gram dose of metronidazole vaginal gel (equivalent to 37.5 mg 
of metronidazole) to 12 normal subjects, a mean maximum serum metronidazole concentration 
of 237 ng/mL was reported (range: 152 to 368 ng/mL). This is approximately 2% of the mean 
maximum serum metronidazole concentration reported in the same subjects administered a 
single, oral 500 mg dose of metronidazole (mean C =
 12,785 ng/mL, range: 10,013 to 17,400 
ng/mL). These peak concentrations
 were obtained in 6 to 12 hours after dosing with 
metronidazole vaginal gel and 1 to 3 hours after dosing with oral me
tronidazole. 
 
The extent of exposure [area under the cu
rve (AUC)] of metronidazole, when administered as a 
single intravaginal 5 gram dose of metronidazole vaginal gel (equivalent to 37.5 mg of 
metronidazole), was approximately 4% of the AUC of a single oral 500 mg dose of 
metronidazole (4977 ng-hr/mL and approximatel
y 125,000 ng-hr/mL, respectively). 

PROTOCOL GDC- 229-002 Version 01.00 Date: 23 January 2017 
 CONFIDENTIAL – PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
 
 Page 58 of 72 Dose-adjusted comparisons of AUCs demonstrated that, on a
 mg to mg comparison basis, the 
absorption of metronidazole, when administered vaginally, was approximately half that of an 
equivalent oral dosage. 
 
Patients with Bacterial Vaginosis: 
Following single and multiple 5 gram doses of metronidazole vaginal gel to 4 patients with 
bacterial vaginosis, a mean maximum serum metronidazole concentration of 214 ng/mL on day 1 
and 294 ng/mL (range: 228 to 349 ng/mL) on day five were reported. Steady state metronidazole 
serum concentrations following oral dosages of 400 to 500 mg BID have been reported to range 
from 6,000 to 20,000 ng/mL. 
 
Microbiology: 
The intracellular targets of action of metronidazole on anaerobes are largely unknown. The 5-
nitro group of metronidazole is reduced by metabolically active anaerobes, and studies have 
demonstrated that the reduced form of the drug interacts with bacterial DNA. However, it is not 
clear whether interaction with DNA alone is an important component in the bactericidal action of 
metronidazole on anaerobic organisms. 
 
Culture and sensitivity testing of bacteria are not routinely performed to establish the diagnosis 
of bacterial vaginosis. (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE .) 
 
Standard methodology for the susceptibility testing of the potential bacterial vaginosis 
pathogens, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus  spp., and Mycoplasma hominis , has not been 
defined. Nonetheless, metronidazole is an a
ntimicrobial agent active in vitro against most strains 
of the following organisms that have been reported to be associated with bacterial vaginosis: 
 
Bacteroides  spp. 
Gardnerella vaginalis 
Mobiluncus  spp. 
Peptostreptococ
cus spp. 
 
INDICATIONS AND USAG
E 
Metronidazole Va
ginal Gel is indicated in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred 
to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, Corynebacterium 
vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis). 
 
NOTE: For purposes of this indication, a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually 
defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that (a) has a pH of greater than 
4.5, (b) emits a “fishy” amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and (c) contains clue 
cells on microscopic examination. Gram’s stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial 
vaginosis include (a) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, (b) predominance 
of Gardnerella morphotype, and (c) absent or few white blood cells.

 Page 59 of 72 Other pathogens commonly associated w
ith vulvovaginitis, e.g., Trichomonas vaginalis, 
Chlamydia trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans,  and Herpes simplex  virus should be 
ruled out. 
 
CONTRAINDICATIO
NS 
Metronidazole Vaginal Ge
l is contraindicated in patients with a prior history of hypersensitivity 
to metronidazole, parabens, other ingredients of the formulation, or other nitroimidazole 
derivatives. 
 
WARNINGS 
Convulsive Seizures and Peripheral Neuropathy: 
Convulsive seizures and peripheral neuropathy, the latter characterized mainly by numbness or 
paresthesia of an extremity, have been reported in patients treated with oral or intravenous 
metronidazole. The appearance of abnormal neurologic signs demands the prompt 
discontinuation of metronidazole vaginal gel therapy. Metronidazole vaginal gel should be 
administered with caution to patients with nervous system diseases.  
 
Psychotic Reactions: 
Psychoti
c reactions have been reported in alcoholic patients who were using oral metronidazole 
and disulfiram concurrently. Metronidazole vaginal gel should not be administered to patients 
who have taken disulfiram within the last two weeks. 
 
PRECAUTIONS 
Metronidazole Vaginal Gel affords minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure (AUCs) of 
metronidazole compared to 500 mg oral metronidazole dosing. Although these lower levels of 
exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral metronidazole, the 
possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded presently. Data from well-controlled 
trials directly comparing metronidazole administered orally to metronidazole administered 
vaginally are not available. 
 
General: 
Patients with severe hepatic disease metabolize metronidazole slowly. This results in the 
accumulation of metronidazole and its metabolites in the plasma. Accordingly, for such patients, 
metronidazole vaginal gel should be administered cautiously. 
 
Known or previously unrecognized vaginal candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms 
during therapy with metronidazole vaginal gel. Approximately 6-10% of patients treated with 
Metronidazole Vaginal Gel developed symptomatic Candida vaginitis during or immediately 
after therapy. 
 
Disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol has been reported with oral metronidazole, thus the 
possibility of such a reaction occurring while on metronidazole vaginal gel therapy cannot be 
excluded.

 Page 60 of 72 Metronidazole Vaginal Gel contains ingredients tha
t may cause burning and irritation of the eye. 
In the event of accidental contact with the eye, rinse the eye with copious amounts of cool tap 
water. 
 
Information for the Patient: 
The patient should be cautioned about drinking alcohol while being treated with metronidazole 
vaginal gel. While blood levels are significantly lower with Metronidazole Vaginal Gel than with 
usual doses of oral metronidazole, a possible interaction with alcohol cannot be excluded. 
 
The patient should be instructed not to engage in vaginal intercourse during treatment with this 
product. 
 
Drug Interactions: 
Oral metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other 
coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. This possible drug 
interaction should be considered when metronidazole vaginal gel is prescribed for patients on 
this type of anticoagulant therapy. 
 
In patients stabilized on relatively high doses of lithium, short-term oral metronidazole therapy 
has been associated with elevation of serum lithium levels and, in a few cases, signs of lithium 
toxicity. 
 
Use of cimetidine with oral me
tronidazole may prolong the half-life and decrease plasma 
clearance of metronidazole. 
 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: 
Metronidazole may interfere with certain types of determinations of serum chemistry values, 
such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides, and glucose hexokinase. Values of zero may be 
observed. All of the assays in which interference has been reported involve enzymatic coupling 
of the assay to oxidation-reduction of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotides (NAD + NADH). 
Interference is due to the similarity in absorbance peaks of NADH (340 nm) and metronidazole 
(322 nm) at pH 7. 
 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: 
Metronidazole has shown evidence of carcinogenic activity in a number of studies involving 
chronic oral administration in mice and rats. Prominent among the effects in the mouse was the 
promotion of pulmonary tumorigenesis. This has been observed in all six reported studies in that 
species, including one study in which the animals were dosed on an intermittent schedule 
(administration during every fourth week only). At very high dose levels (approximately 500 
mg/kg/day), there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of malignant liver 
tumors in males. Also, the published results of one of the mouse studies indicate an increase in 
the incidence of malignant lymphomas as well as pulmonary neoplasms associated with lifetime 
feeding of the drug. All these effects are statistically significant. Several long-term oral dosing 
studies in the rat have been completed. There were statistically significant increases in the 

PROTOCOL GDC- 229-002 Version 01.00 Date: 23 January 2017 
 CONFIDENTIAL – PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
 
 Page 61 of 72 incidence of various neoplasms, particularly in m
ammary and hepatic tumors, among female rats 
administered metronidazole over those noted in the concurrent female control groups. Two 
lifetime tumorigenicity studies in hamsters have been performed and reported to be negative. 
These studies have not been conducted with 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel, which would 
result in significantly lower systemic blood levels than those obtained with oral formulations. 
 
Although metronidazole has shown mutagenic activity in a number of in vitro assay systems, 
studies in mammals (in vivo) have failed to demonstrate a potential for genetic damage. 
 
Fertility studies have been performed in mice up to six times the recommended human oral dose 
(based on mg/m2) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility. 
 
Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effec
ts: 
 
Pregnancy Category B 
 
There has been no experience to date with the use of Metronidazole Vaginal Gel in pregnant 
patients. Metronidazole crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation rapidly. No 
fetotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed when metronidazole was administered orally to 
pregnant mice at six times the recommended human dose (based on mg/m2); however, in a 
single small study where the drug was a
dministered intraperitoneally, some intrauterine deaths 
were observed. The relationship of these findings to the drug is unknown. 
 
There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal 
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and because metronidazole is 
a carcinogen in rodents, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. 
 
Nursing Mothers: 
Specific studies of metronidazole levels in human milk following intravaginally administered 
metronidazole have not been performed. However, metronidazole is secreted in human milk in 
concentrations similar to those found in plasma following oral administration of metronidazole. 
 
Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for metronidazole in mouse and rat studies, a 
decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into 
account the importance of the drug to the mother. 
 
Pediatric Use: 
Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.

Clinical Trials: 
 
There were
 no deaths or serious adverse events related to drug therapy in clinical trials involving 
800 non-pregnant women who received Metronidazole Vaginal Gel. 
 
In a randomized, single-blind clinical trial of 505 non-pregnant women who received 
Metronidazole Vaginal Gel once or twice a day, 2 patients (one from each regimen) discontinued 
therapy early due to drug-related adverse events. One patient discontinued drug because of 
moderate abdominal cramping and loose stools, while the other patient discontinued drug 
because of mild vaginal burning. These symptoms resolved after discontinuation of drug. 
 
Medical events judged to be related, probably related, or possibly related to administration of 
Metronidazole Vaginal Gel once or twice a day were reported for 195/505 (39%) patients. The 
incidence of individual adverse reactions were not significantly different between the two 
regimens. Unless percentages are otherwise stipulated, the incidence of individual adverse 
reactions listed below was less than 1%: 
 
Reproductive: 
Vaginal discharge (12%), 
Symptomatic 
Candida  cervicitis/vaginitis (10%), 
Vulva/vaginal irritative symptoms (9%),
 
Pelvic discomfort (3%). 
Gastrointestinal: 
Gastrointestinal discomfort (7%), 
Nausea and/or vomiting (4%), 
Unusual taste (2%), 
Diarrhea/loose stools (1%), 
Decreased appetite (1%), 
Abdominal bloating/gas; thirsty, dry mouth.

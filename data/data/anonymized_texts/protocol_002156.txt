Version 2.0, 26April 2019
The primary  reasons for am ending this protocol are to:
Delete peak Forced Expi ratory  Volume in 1 Second (FEV 1) from the secondary  
efficacy  endpoints as it was added in error and this endpo int is not m easured .
Update the study  period.
Update the inclusio n criteria to include only pat ients wi th body  mass index 
(BMI) ≤35.
Delete the expected number of patients in the United States (US) versus non -US 
sitesas the number o f patients in the US sites might be less than originally  
planned .
Removeinterim futilit y analysis as it is determined no interim futilit y analysis is 
to be conducted. Patient recruit ment into the study  has been faster than planned 
and all pat ients are expected to be enro lled before the time po int at whi ch the 
interim analysis was planned to be completed. Many  patients will also have 
completed treatm ent at that timepo int. The value of the fut ility analysis has 
therefore been determined to be limited.
Incorporate the updated Hy’s Law (Version 2.0, dated 10 January  2019) in the 
Clinical Study  Protocol  Appendix D .
All changes made to specific sect ions in the protocol were also implemented elsewhere in 
the protocol and in the synopsis, where applicable. Major changes to the protocol are 
summari sed below:

A Phase 2b Randomis ed, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Parallel Arm, 
Multi-Centre Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Multiple Dose Levels 
of AZD7594 DPI Given Once Daily for Twelve Weeks, Compared to 
Placebo, in Asthmatics Symptomatic on Low Dose ICS
International Co -ordinating Investigator
  
Study centre (s) and number of patient s planned
It is planned that approximately 714 patientswith asthma symptom atic on low dose inhaled 
corticosteroi d (ICS)will be rando mised into the study, 102 patients per arm.
The study  will be conducted in approximately 100 centres in 8 countri esin Europe, United 
States (US) , South Africa, and Japan.
Study period Phase of development
Estimated date of first patient enrolled Q12019 Phase 2b
Estimated date of last patient completed Q32019 Phase 2b
Study design
This is a rando mised, pl acebo -controlled, double -blind study  with an open -labelactive 
comparator ICS (fluticasone furoate [FF])arm to assess the efficacy and safet y of AZD7594
administered once daily (QD) by inhalation at multiple dose levels over a 12-week treatment 
period to pati ents wi thasthma symptom atic on low dose ICS.
The primary  object ive is to determine the efficacy of AZD7594 as assessed by change from 
baseline in trough forced expiratory  volume in 1second (FEV 1)at Week 12, when compared 
to placebo ,with the aim o f select ing doses to advance to Phase 3 studi es.Secondary  efficacy 
assessments include asthma control  questi onnai re (ACQ -5), fractional exhaled nitric oxide 
(FENO),forced vital capacit y (FVC), peak expiratory  flow (PEF), rescue medicat ion use, 
night -time awakenings ,daily  asthma symptom s as recorded in an electroni c diary  (eDiary) , 
and “CompE x”, a com posite endpoint for severe exacerbat ions of asthma which combines
severe exacerbat ionsand d iary events (ie, combinati on of  eDiary  variables) .
Other secondary  object ives of the study include the descript ion of the (steady  state) 
pharmacokinet ics (PK) and the pharmacodynamics (assessment of cortiso l suppression) of 
AZD7594 in a subset of patients. Only selected sites that are capable of doing qualit y PK (and

8(122)cortisol) sampling will part icipate i n the PK subset. The safet y and tol erabilit y of AZD7594 
will also be evaluated in relat ion to pl acebo.
Exploratory  objectives will include the use of Forced Oscillat ion Technique (FOT) (as a 
measure of small airways invo lvement ) for pati ents in the U S and Eu rope, a genomics (Gx) 
analysis .
The study  will consist of a Run-inPeriod(Visits 1 to 3) , a Treatment Period (Visits 4 to 7) and 
a Follow -up Contact (Visit 8) .
In addit ion, all patients will be provided a short -acting beta 2agonis t (SABA )
(salbutamo l/albuterol) as rescue medicat ionfor use throughout the run-in and treatm ent 
periods.
All patient s will sign informed consent form (ICF) prior to parti cipat ing in any study -specific 
procedures .
The Run-in Period will t ypically last 21 -28 day s (up to a m aximum of 35 days , if Visi t3 is 
repeated )and will consist of 3 visits: a Screening Visit (Visit 1), a Reversibilit y Visit (Vi sit 2) 
and a Rando misat ion Visit (Visit 3) . Patients found to be eligible at Visit 1 (Screening Visit)
will discont inue all asthma medicat ions and switch to low dose budesonide (200 µg twice a 
day [BID]in Europe and 180 µg BID in US) and rescue medicat ion will be taken as needed. 
Visit1 (Screening Visit) and Visit 2can occur the same day, unless the patient is taking a 
long-acting beta agonist (LABA), fixed dose combinat ion ICS/LABA treatment or a 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), in which case the patient will return for Visit 2
between 2 to 7 day s after Vi sit1to allow sufficient time to wash -out thei r asthma 
medicat ions.
Visit 2 will  occur wi thin 7 days of Visit 1 and will assess reversibilit y (increase of FEV 1
≥12% and ≥200 mL after administration of a short -acting bronchodilator). All pat ients should 
refrain from taking SABA for 6 hours prior to reversibilit y testing. If a pati ent does not m eet 
reversibilit y criteria, Vi sit 2can be repeated once within 1 week. If reversibilit ycriteria are 
not achieved at the repeat attempt, the patient will bediscont inued from the study .
If reversibilit y criteria are m et at Visit 2, patients will proceed to Visit 3 . Randomisat ion will 
occur at Visit 3, within 21 to 28 day s of Visit 1. At Visit 3,patients who remain symptomat ic 
while on low dose budesonide (as assessed by asthma mean symptom score > 1over the 
previous 7 days or use of a SA BA on ≥3 day s of the previous 7 days) and m eet FEV 1criteria 
(≥40% to ≤90% predicted at either −45 or −15 minutes pre -dose) will be rando mised to one o f 
7possible treatment arms (see below). If patients do not meet eligibilit y (especially  symptom  
criteria or lung funct ion criteria),Visit 3 can be repeated once within 1 week. If this occurs, 
additional budesonide may  need to be provi ded to the pati ent to ensure that the patient has 
run-in medicat ion (budesonide) available throughout the run -in period.
Patients who are uncontrolled duri ng the Run -in Peri od (as per an ACQ -5 score of ≥3 or daily  
rescue medication(SABA) use of ≥12 puffs for ≥ 3 consecutive days) or those wi th <80%

13(122)Statistical methods
Sample Siz e Determination
Approximately  102 patients will be rando mised to each arm ( overall randomisat ion rati o 
1:1:1:1:1:1:1 )in order to ensure at least 86 evaluable pat ients per arm . This sample size will 
provi de at least 80% power to detect a difference in the primary endpo int, ie, a difference of 
175mL in change fro m baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 1 2 between each dose of AZD7594 
and placebo, assuming a n inter-patient standard deviat ion of 405 mL, using a 2 -sided test wi th 
a significance level o f 0.05 and wi th an est imated 15% dropout rate. The targeted total number 
of patients to be randomised is approximately  714patients.
Interim futility analysis 
Not applicable .
Primary efficacy analysis
The primary  variable is the change fro m baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 12 .Baseline for 
FEV 1will be defined as the mean of the 2 measured values fo r the cor responding variable 
(2measurements 30 minutes apart, at −45 minutes and −15 minutes, before IP administration), 
on Day  1. Trough will be defined as the mean of the 2 FEV 1measurements 30 minutes apart 
(23 hours after last dose). 
The change from baseline in trough FEV 1will be analysed using a MMRM wit h treatment, 
visit, treatment by  visit interacti on and regi on (US, Japan, and Rest of the World[RoW] ) as 
fixed effects, and baseline FEV 1and baseline FEV 1by visit interaction as cont inuous 
covari ates. The within-patient correlation will be modelled using the unstructured covariance 
matri x. The Kenward -Roger approximat ion will be used to estimate denominator degrees of 
freedo m.The m ain co mpar isons will be between each AZD7594 dose and placebo at 
Week 12.The comparison between active co mparator (FF) and placebo will be used for bench 
marking.
To control  type I error rate for the primary  efficacy endpo int comparisons at Week 12, a 
sequent ial hierarchical step -down approach will be used. This approach starts from testing the 
highest dose versus placebo first, using a two -sided alpha of 0.05. If this p -value is ≤0.05 for 
the com parison, then the next highest dose versus placebo will be tested using the same two -
sided al pha of 0.05. This process continues unt il the first p -value >0.05 occurs or the lowest 
dose versus placebo is tested.
The primary  analysis will be based on the full analysis set (FAS) population and addit ionally  
for sensi tivity purposes on the per protocol (PP) populat ion. Further subgroup analyse s will  be 
done to evaluate treatment effects for trough FEV 1at Week 12.

Change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week s2, 4, 8, and average over the treatment 
period
Change from baseline in FENOat Week s2, 4, 8, 12, and average over the treatment 
period(analysis to be done on natural log -scale and resul ts back -transform ed to linear 
scale)
Change from baseline in trough FVC at Week 12 and average over the treatment 
period
Change from baseline in ACQ -5 at Week 12 and average over the treatment period
Change from baseline in average m orning PEF over the treatment period
Change from baseline in average e vening PEF over the treatment period
Change from baseline in averag e daily use of rescue medicat ion over the treatment 
period
Change from baseline in percent night -time awakening days over the treatment period
Change from baseline in average daily asthma symptom score over the treatment 
period
Change from baseline in percentasthm a control  days over the treatm ent peri od
Change from baseline in percent rescue -free days over the treatment period
Change from baseline in percent symptom -free days over the treatment period
Time to first CompEx event, time to recurrent CompEx ev ent, and Com pEx event rate
Similar mixed models for repeated measures as for the primary  variable will be used for the 
analysis at specified visit week. Analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA )with treatm ent and regi on 
(ie, US, Japan, and RoW ) as fixed effects, and baseline as covariate will be used for the 
analysis of aver age over the treatment period. No mult iplicit y adjust ments will be applied for 
the secondary  variables .
Com pEx will be analy sed with a Cox proporti onal hazards m odel, a m arginal  means/rates 
model, and a n egative bino mial model for time to first event, time to recurrent event, and 
event rate (due to observat ion time per patient) respectively, with region and treatment 
included as covariates in all models .

15(122)PK analysis
Sampling for PK analysis will be done in a subset of patients. Steady  state PKparam eters of 
AZD7594 will be derived using non -compart mental methods with Phoenix®WinNonlin® 
Versi on 6.3 or hi gher.
A listing of PK blood sample collect ion times, as well as derived sampling t ime deviat ions 
will be provided.
Plasma concentrations will be listed and summarised by  treatm ent using appropri ate 
descript ive statistics. Where possible, the fo llowing descri ptive statist ics will be presented: n, 
geom etric mean, geom etric coefficient of variat ion, arithmetic m ean, ari thmet ic standard 
deviat ion (SD), m edian, minimum and maximum based on the PK analysis set. Plasma 
concentrations that are below lower limit of quant ificat ionwill be handled as described in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP).
Combined i ndividual  plasma concentrati on per dose l evel (spaghetti  plots) will be presented in 
linear and semi -logarithmic scale with separate plots for each dose level.
Figures for the geometric mean concentration -time data will be presented for all doses 
overl aid on the sam e plot, in both a linear and semi -logarithmic scale.
Addit ional graphical presentations of PK data may be added at the discretion of the PK 
scientist. More details will be provided in the SAP.
All plasma PK parameters will be listed for each pati ent and summarised by treatment using 
similar descriptive statist ics. For t max only n, median, minimum  and maximum will be 
reported.
Data from pat ients excluded fro m the PK analysis set will be included in the data list ings, but 
not in the descriptive stat istics or in the inferential statist ics.
Dose proporti onalit y of AZD7594 on Week 12 (Day  84) will  be assessed graphically  and 
analysed using the power model approach with the natural logarithm of PK parameters ( Css,max
and AUC τ)as the dependent variable and the l ogari thm of the dose as the independent 
variable.
Further details regarding the model specificat ions will be provided in the SAP.
Pharmacodynamic analysis
As a m easure of corti sol suppression, 24 -hourplasma cortiso l measurements will be 
perform edin the same subset of patients as PK sampling and a selected subset of FF treated 
patients.Plasma corti sol will be measured j ust before and at the end of the Treatment Period.
Measurement before the first dose will serve as a baseline value. P atients wil l be re quired to 
stay overnight for 24 hours before IP administration on Day 1 and for 24 h ours after the last 
dose on Day  84.

16(122)The change from baseline in log -transform ed AUEC (0-24)(area under the plasma cortisol 
concentration -time curve fro m zero to 24 hours after dose) will be analy sed by ANCOVA 
approach wi th treatm ent as a fixed effect, baseline log AUEC as a covariate, and patient as a 
rando m effect. The est imated ratio for each AZD 7594 arm versus placebo and FF versus 
placebo, and thei rassociated 95 % confidence interval swill be presented.
Exploratory analyses
An ACQ -5 responder analysis will be explored based on the percentage of ACQ -5 responders 
at Week s2, 4, 8, and 12. An ACQ -5 responder i s defined as a patient with a decrease from 
baseline of ≥0.5 in their ACQ -5score .
Measures of airway resistance and reactance via FOT,  
and Gxvariables will be analysed at Week 12 by using mixed models for 
repeated m easures as for the primary variable.
In addit ion, dose -response modelling for trough FEV 1 and the relat ionship between AZD7594 
exposure and plasma cortiso l AUEC (0-24)may be explored. 
Safety analysis
Safety will be assessed by descript ive analysis o fvital signs, ECGs, laboratory  assessments 
and AEs reported.

28 (122 )1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
AZD7594 is a non-steroi dal, potent and sel ective m odulator of the gl ucocorti coid receptor 
(GR) under development for once daily (QD) inhaled treatment of chronic obstructive 
pulmo nary disease (COPD) and asthma .
Inhaled corticosteroi ds(ICSs) are the cornerstone of the rapy for asthm a patients of all severit y 
levels .The Gl obal Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2018guidelines (GINA , 201 8), as well as the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal 
products for the treatment of asthma ( CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1 , 2015 )recommend ICS as 
first-line treatment for all asthmat ic patients requi ring regul ar anti -inflammatory  therapy .ICS 
have been shown to improve symptom control, lung funct ion and qualit y of life; reduce 
exacerbations, asthma -related hospi talisations and death .However, ICS have known 
side-effects wi th long-term use. Therefore, a GR agonist with a better therapeutic index 
(balance between desired and undesired effects) than current ly available ICSs couldimprove 
the available treatment options for asthma patients.
The GRis a well -known target and there is extensive clinical experience with GR agonists 
used asICSs .Besides co mmo n local adverse react ions such as hoarseness and oral 
candidiasis, which are inconvenient for the patient but not of a serious nature, GR agonists 
have the potential to cause systemic side -effects such as effects on the hypothalamic -pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) axis and effects on bone mineral densit y and (in children) growth velocit y.
These systemic effects are rare, and generally related to long -term treatment wi th high doses
(Christensson , 2008 ).
AZD7594 is a non -steroi dalGR m odulator andmay have several potential benefits over 
convent ional ICS .Non-clinical pharmaco logy studies in the Sephadex rat model, known to 
provi de reasonable est imates of the relative potency o f GR agonists inhumans, indicate that 
the therapeutic index may be improved for AZD7594 compared with current ly marketed 
inhaled stero idal GR agonists such as flut icasone propi onate .The high select ivity of 
AZD7594 for the GRover other steroid nuclear hormone receptors and the high degree of 
plasma protein binding (>99%) could also theoretically be beneficial .
AZD7594 has a predi cted 24-hour duration of its effect that coul d improve convenience, and ,
potenti ally adherence to prescribed treatment, an acknowledged challenge in current COPD 
and asthma management .
Theaim is to develop AZD7594 as a once daily  inhaled non-steroi dalselect ive GR modulator
(SGRM) , whi ch may  ultimately  lead to better di sease control of both COPD and asthma 
through improved efficacy and compliance. The overall rat ionale for developing a once daily  
AZD7594 in adry powder inhaler (DPI) is to provide a safe and e ffective future treatment 
option for both asthm a and COPD pati ents.

29 (122 )1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups
The obj ective o f the study  is to assess the efficacy and safet yof multipledose l evels o f 
AZD7594 as com pared to pl acebo after a 12 -week treatment period in pat ients with asthma 
symptom atic on low dose ICS. The comparison between placebo and an active comparator 
(fluticasone furoate [FF]) will be used for bench marking. AZD7594 (steady  state) 
pharmacokinet ics (PK) of the multiple dose levelsof AZD7594 will be assessed in a subset of 
patients .In addition, 24-h ourplasma cortiso l sampling will be carried out to assess cortiso l 
suppressio n as a measure of HPA axis suppressio n, a well -known class -effect of inhaled ICS
(Dahl, 2006 ; Wlodarczyk et al , 2008 ).The target populat ion inclu des male and female 
patients, aged 18 to 85years with body  mass index (BMI) ≤35, with a clinical diagnosis of 
asthma as per the criteria of the GINA 201 8and EMA guidelines ( GINA , 201 8) 
(CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1 , 2015 ) who are symptomat ic on lowdose ICS and demonstrate 
bronchodilator reversibilit y (increase of trough forced expiratory  volume in 1 second [ FEV 1]
≥12% and ≥200 mL after administration of a short -acting bronchodilator) .
A placebo -controlled, double -blinded design has been chosen to limit the occurrence of 
conscious and unconscious bias in the conduct and interpre tation of  theclinical study  arising 
from the influence thatthe knowl edge of treatm ent may  have on the recrui tment and 
allocat ion of pat ients.It is considered the optimal approach according to Int ernational C ouncil  
forHarm onisat ion (ICH) E9 “Statistical principles in clinical studi es”.The active comparator 
(FF) will be open -label. An overall 1:1:1:1:1:1:1 rando misat ion rati o has been selected to 
avoid any possible bias.
Matching placebo will be u sed as anegat ive control and FFwill be used as apositive control  
for assessing AZD7594 characteri stics.An open -label act ive comparator has been chosen over 
a doubl e-dummy design because of the difficult ies to produce a placebo of the active 
comparator .The DPI device containing AZD7594 or placebo will  have the same external 
appearance to ensure the double -blinded nature of the study .Neither the active com pound nor 
the placebo has percept ible taste, appearance, odour or colour that could unmask their id entity.
By randomly assigning treatments , differences in baseline characterist ics of the treatment 
groups will be minimised. FF was chosen as an active co mparator at the recommendat ion of
the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )because of the once daily  dosing, and the need to 
demonstrate efficacy .
The inclusio n of a placebo arm is considered the most reliable method to minimise pat ient and 
Invest igator bias according to ICH E10 “ Choice of control group in clinical trials ”, 
ICH/364/96 guideline adopted by the Committee for Proprietary  Medicinal Products (CPMP), 
CPMP/EWP/562/98 and the FDA. The use of placebo is also recommended by the EMA 
regul atory  guidance in the design of dose -finding studies for moderate- severe asthma.
The proposed dose levels o f AZD75 94 in this study  range f rom 50µg to 720 µg QD
(delivered dose) .Doses have been selected based on the safety , tolerabili ty, PK, and 
pharmacodynamics informat ion generated in previous AZD7594 clinical studie s.Three 
AZD7594 dose levels (58 µg, 250 µg and 8 00µg [delivered doses]) have been tested in a 
2week incomplete block crossover study  in asthmatic pat ients.There was a clear dose

30 (1 22)ordering o f the response as measured by primary endpo int of trough FEV 1on Day 15, wi th the 
highest effect obse rved in the 800 µg dose group. All dose levels were found to be safe and 
well tolerated. The cortiso l suppressio n at the highest dose (720 µg) is predicted to be <10%. 
The proposed dose levelsshoul d adequately  cover the therapeutic dose range .
For further details, refer to the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB).
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
Patients parti cipating in the early  clinical  studi es of AZD7594 will obtain no individual 
benefit from their participat ion in the studies .The aim o f the early studi es is to enable further 
investigat ions in pat ients to evaluate and develop AZD7594 as a once daily  select ive inhaled 
GR m odulator f or treatm ent for COPD and asthma, with an acceptable side -effect profile 
compared to inhaled GR agonists already on the market.
Data havebeen gathered from previous clinical experience wit h GR agonists, non -clinical 
safet y pharmaco logy and toxi cology studi es and clinical studies wit h AZD7594 .The GR is a 
well-known target and there is extensive clinical experience wit h GR agonists use a s ICSs .
The side -effect profile of inhaled GR agonists is well -known and consists of local effects 
including oropharyngeal candidiasis, dysphonia and cough, as well as systemic effects such as 
skin thinning and bruising, endocrine/metabo lic effects (includ ing HPA suppression), 
osteoporosi s and (in children) reduced growth velo city(Dahl, 2006). Pneumonia has also been 
noted wi th ICS use, especially  in patients with severe COPD (GOLD, 2017 ).Although 
AZD7594 is not a steroid, given the shared target, theside-effect profile is potentially similar . 
In preclinical studi es,AZD7594 displayed features ty pical  of a potent GR agonist . Findings in 
humans can be monitored and are expected tobe reversible .In the clinical studies conducted 
to date, AZD7594 was generally safe and well tolerated, though HPA suppressio n was seen at 
inhaled delivered doses higher than 1248 µg .Overall, the data generated suggest no findings 
of concern that would preclude proposed clinical studies with inhaled administration of 
AZD7594 .Intravenous and oral dosing o f AZD7594 (single doses) are also supported by  the 
available data.
The developme nt of any AE, abnormalit y in laboratory  variables or any  other safet y variables 
will be closely  monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis during the clinical studies. Data 
from patients and healthy vo lunteers involved in the current and future AZD7594 clinical  
studi es will be m onitored f or electrocardiogram ( ECG ), spirometry (only  in pat ients with 
asthma or COPD), clinical chemistry , vital signs, adverse events ( AEs)andPK.To further 
investigate the effect of AZD7 594 on corti sol suppressio n, 24 -hourplasma cortisol levels will 
be measured in a subset of patients in the current ,as well as future clinical studies .Systemic 
absorpti on can occur di rectly through the lung surface or by swallowing the drug .In 
accordance with standard practice, patients will be instructed to wash the ir mo uth after drug 
inhalat ion to reduce local and systemic side effects . 
This st udy will include a pl acebo arm .The use of the placebo arm may  increase the ri sk of 
asthma exacerbation amo ng enrolled patients randomised to this tr eatment. However, the 
inclusio n of a placebo arm is in accordance with EMA (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1 , 2015 ),

31 (122 )which reco mmends rando mised, double -blind, placebo -controlled trials for dose- finding 
studi es. This approach has previously been used safely  in moderate -to-severe asthma 
popul ations to study  the efficacy  of FF(Bleeker et al , 2012 and Busse et al , 2012 ).
Patients enrolled in the trial will be requested to take pro tocol -defined asthma medicat ions 
only.All pat ients will be provided with a short -acting beta 2agonist (SABA) 
(salbutamo l/albuterol) to be used as rescue medication throughout the run-in and treatm ent 
periods. Although som epatientmay have an increased risk of deterioration based on a 
decrease in their total inhaled steroid dose, this risk will be minimi sed by frequent study  visits, 
symptom  reporting, and contact with medical personnel. The Investigators will carefully 
monitor the patients throughout the study , and evidence of asthma progression (through study  
visits and eDiary  recordings of lung funct ion, symptom score, and rescue inhaler use ), will 
trigger an alert to the local clinician as well as the medical mo nitor. Patients wh ose asthma is 
not con trolled on l owdose ICS during the Run -in Period will be discontinued fro m the study , 
and pat ients are free to withdraw from participation in the study  at any  time. Upon com pletion 
of the study , pati ents are not restri cted in the choic e of medical therapies.
For further details, r efer to the IB.
1.4 Study d esign 
This is a rando mised, pl acebo -controlled, double -blind study  with an open -labelactive 
comparator ICS (FF)arm to assess the e fficacy and safet y of AZD7594 administered QDby 
inhalat ion at multiple dose levels over a 12-week treatment period to patients with asthma
symptom atic on low dose ICS.
The study  will be conducted in approximately 100 centres in 8 countri es in Europe, United 
States (US) , South Africa, and Japan. It is planned that approximately 714 patients will be 
rando mised into the study , 102 patients per arm .The total durati on of  the study  will be 
between 113 to 135days for each individual pat ientand is planned to run approximately
12months(it should not exceed 18 months).
The primary  object iveof the study is to determine the efficacy o f AZD7594 as assessed by 
change in trough forced expiratory  volume in 1second (FEV 1)at Week 12 ,when co mpared to 
placebo ,with the aim of select ing doses to advance to P hase 3 studi es.
All patients will sign an informed consent form (ICF) prior to participat ing in any 
study -specific procedures. 
The study  will consist of a Run -in Period (Visits 1 to 3) , a Treatment Period (Visits 4 to 7) and 
a Follow -up Contact (Visit 8) (Figure 1). All pat ients will be provided budesonide for the 
run-in period, a SABA ( salbutam ol/albuterol ) as rescue m edicati onfor use throug hout the 
run-in and treatment periods and will be randomly  assigned to AZD7594, FF, or placebo 
during the treatment period. Patients will record daily symptoms, peak flow, and rescue 
medicat ion use in eDiaries.

32(122)Run-inPeriod : Thi s peri od will typically las t 21 to 28 days (up to a maximum of 35 days , if 
Visit3 is repeated )and consist of 3 visits: a Screening Visit (Visit1), a Reversibilit y Visit 
within 7 days of Visit 1 (Visit 2)and, i f reversibili tycriteria are met (increase of FEV 1≥12% 
and ≥200mL after administration o f a short -acting bronchodilator) , a Rando misat ion Visit 
within 21 to 28 day s of Visit 1 (Visit3).
Patients found to be eligible at Visit 1 will discont inue all asthma medications and switch to 
low dose budesonide (200 µg twice a day  [BID]in Europe and 180 µg BID in US) and rescue 
medicat ion will be taken as needed .Visit1(Screening Visit) and Visit 2can occur the same 
day, unless the pati ent is taking medication that precludes reversibilit y testing, including 
long-acting beta agoni st (LABA) , fixed dose combinat ion ICS/LABA treatment orlong-acting 
muscarinic antagoni st (LAMA), in which case the patient will return for Visit 2 between 2 to 
7days after Vi sit1,to allow sufficient time to wash -out thei r asthma m edicati ons.
All patients should refrain fro m taking SABA 6 hours pri or to reversibilit y testing .If a patient 
does not m eet reversibilit y criteria, Visit 2can be repeated once within 1week .If 
reversibilit ycriteria are not achi eved at the repeat attempt, the patient will be discontinued 
from the study .
Randomisation V isit (Visit 3) : Patients who remain symptomatic while on low dose 
budesonide (as assessed by asthma mean symptom score >1over the previous 7 days or use of 
a SABA on ≥3 days of the previous 7 days) and meet FEV 1criteria ( ≥40% to ≤90% predicted
at either −45 or −15 minutes pre -dose) will be randomised to one of 7 possible treatment arms
(see below) .If pat ients do not meet eligibilit y (especi ally symptom  criteria or l ung function 
criteria) , Visit 3 can be repeated once within 1 week. If this occurs, addit ional budesonide may  
need to be provided to the patient to ensure that the patient has run -in medicat ion (budesonide) 
available throug hout the run -in period.
If at any  point during the study , patient’sasthm a becom esuncontrolled (as per Asthma 
Control  Quest ionnaire [ ACQ -5]score of ≥3 or daily  rescue (SABA) use of ≥12 puffs for 
≥3consecut ive days) they will be discont inued from the stu dy. Patients who dem onstrate
<80% eDi ary com pliance during Run -in Period ,will not be randomised. Once a pati ent has 
failed screening, re -screening will not be allowed.
Treatment Period: Thisperiodwillinclude 4visits (Visit 4 to Visit 7) and will last 12weeks .
At Visit 3, each patient will receive one of the fo llowing 7 possible treatments:
AZD7594 DPI 55μg [nominal strength]/50 µg [delivered dose] (QD)
AZD7594 DPI 99 µg/90 µg QD
AZD7594 DPI 198 µg/180 µg QD

exclusio n criteria will apply:
 Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant
 Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusio n wit hin 120 days of the date of the 
genomicsample co llection
3.4 Patient enro lment and randomisation
Invest igator(s) should keep a record, the patient S creening and Enrol ment log, of all patients
who entered the study , including those who failed th e screening .
At Visit 3, approximately  714 patients will be randomly  assigned to one of the 7 possible 
treatm entsusing a n overall balanced 1:1:1:1:1:1:1 rando misat ion rati o.Thus, approximately 
102patients will be assigned to each treatment arm.There wi ll be a stratificat ion factor for 
US, Japan, and Rest of the W orld(RoW) ,with different allo cation rati os.
The Rando mizat ion and Trial Supply Management ( RTSM )specificat ion will have
stratificat ion by region (US versus Japan versus RoW ) and PK sub study participat ion (Yes 
versus No) in Ro W countries excluding South Africa. PK sub study will only  take pl ace in 
RoW countries excluding South Africa and is not permitted in US and Japan.
Prior to ini tiating the study , a com puter -generated rando misat ion schedu le will be prepared to 
assign a treatment to a randomisat ion number by PAREXEL through AZRand according to 
the relevant Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) .The rando misat ion schedule will describe 
the link between the rando mly assigned treatments to each r ando misat ion number .The block 
size will be determined in agreement with the Clinical Study  Manager and the Statist ician, and 
will not be communicated to the Invest igators. Further details will be included in the user 
requi rement specification document .
The Investi gator(s) will:
1. Obtain signed informed consent fro m the pati ent before any  study -specific 
procedures are performed
2. Call/access the Interactive Voice Response Sy stem (IVRS)/Interactive Web 
Response Sy stem  (IWRS) to assi gn potential  patientsa unique ident ificat ion 
number .This number will be composed of 2 parts: the first part will have 4 digits 
(fixed) represent ing the site identifier .The second part will have 3 digits 
(ascending) which will be assigned sequent ially with in each site, starting with 001
3. Determine patient eligibilit y at Visi ts 1 to 3.See Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3

41 (122 )4. For pati ents f ulfilling the eligibilit y criteria at Visi t3, the Invest igator will 
call/access IVRS/IWRS to assign a unique rando misation n umber and medicat ion 
kit number
If a patient withdraws fro m participat ion inthe study , then his/her enrolment/randomisat ion 
code cannot be reused.
Randomisat ion data will be kept strictly confident ial, accessible only to authorised persons, 
until the t ime of unblinding of the allocated treatment of all study  patients after l ockin g the 
database upon terminat ion of the study .When the study  is completed and the data verified and 
locked and the populat ions defined, the randomisatio n list will be made available for data 
analysis.
Randomisat ion codes will be assigned in strict sequent ialorder, as eligible pat ients are 
ident ified for randomisat ion.
3.5 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomis ed 
patient s
Patients who fail to meet eligibilit y criteria shoul d not, under any  circumstances, be enrolled
or receive study  medicat ion. There can be no exceptions to this rule. Patient s who are 
enrolled, but subsequent ly found not to m eet all the eligibilit y criteria,must not be rando mised 
or init iated on treatment, and must be withdrawn from the study.
Where a patient does not meet all eligibilit y criteria but i s randomis ed in error, or incorrectly  
started on treatment, the Invest igator should inform the PAREXEL Medical Moni tor
immediately , and a discussi on shoul d occur between the PAREXEL Medical Monitor and the 
Invest igator regarding whether to continue or discontinue the patientfrom treatm ent.The 
AstraZeneca Study Physician will also be informed and PAREXEL must ensure all decisio ns 
are appropriately documented.
3.6 Methods for assigning treatment groups
PAREXEL will be responsible for generating the rando misation scheme through AZRand .
The cho ice of treatm ent group i s balanced. The approximate randomisat ion ratio is shown in 
Table 1. Patients will be allocated to the 7 treatm ent groups in a n overall 1:1:1:1:1:1:1 rati o.
For si tes in the US, no pati ents will be rando mised to the AZD7594 DPI 792 µg/720 µg QD 
group.

Randomisat ion will be performed using the centra lised IVRS/IWRS at Visit 3 (Day 1).
Specific information concerning the use of the IVRS/IWRS will be provided i n a separate 
manual .Rando mised pat ients who discontinue from treatment will not be replaced .At 
rando misat ion, the IVRS/IWRS will inform the site about the medicat ion kit numbers to be 
administered and dispensed to each particular patient.
The rando misat ion list will only  be provi ded to the following personnel:
 AstraZeneca personnel responsible f or study  medicati on preparati on
 Covance Bioanaly tical group responsible for PK analyses
3.7 Methods for ensuring blinding
All double -blind m edicati on ki ts will have si milar appearance regardless of the IP(AZD7594 
or placebo) contained in a DPI device and will be labelled using a unique medicat ion 
ident ificat ion number (Kit ID) that is linked to a treatment arm .IVRS/IWRS will assign the 
study  medicat ion to be dispensed to each pati ent at Visit 3.
Supplies of budesonide , FFand SABA (salbutamol/albuterol )will be open -label.
3.8 Methods for unblinding 
Individual treatment codes, indicat ing the treatment randomisation for each randomised 
patient, will  be available to the Inv estigator(s) or pharmacists from the IVRS/IWRS .Only 
authori sed personnel at the research site will receive unblinding permit s in IVRS/IWRS .
Patientswill be immediately  withdrawn from  the study  once treatm ent has been unblinded.

Version 2.0
Date 26 April 2019
43 (122 )Routines for this will be described in the IVRS/IWRS user manual that will be provided to 
each centre.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment randomisat ion.The 
Invest igator will docum ent and report the action to AstraZeneca/PAREXEL, without revealing 
the treatment given to the patient to the AstraZeneca/PAREXEL staff.
Personnel responsible for analysing PK samples will be unblinded as to the exact con tent of 
investigat ional treatm ents (i e, the randomisat ion code) .AstraZeneca retains the right to break 
the code for serious adverse events (SAE s) that are unexpected and are suspected to be 
causal ly related to an IP and that potentially  require expedi ted reporting to Regul atory  
Authori ties.Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all 
decisio ns on the evaluabilit y of the data from  each individual pat ient have been m ade and 
docum ented.
3.9 Restrictions
Patients enrolledin the study should adhere to the fo llowing restri ctions for the durati on of  the 
study .Any event likely  to interfere wi th the obj ectives of the study will be co mmunicated to 
the Invest igator and reported without delay to AstraZeneca.
 Patient shoul d keep regul ar night/day  shift s
 Blood donati on is n ot allowed throughout the study
 The fo llowing activit ies should preferably be avo ided prior to lung funct ion testing:

Consuming caffeine within 6 hours before testing
Performing vigorous exerci se wi thin 30 minutes before testi ng
Wearing clothing that substant ially restricts full chest and abdo minal exp ansion
Eating a l arge meal wit hin 2 hours before testing
 Patients s hould avoi d taking inhaled bronchodilators prior to spirometry  (see 
Secti on7.7).A SABA should be withheldforat least 6 hours before each visit up to the 
last procedure on that visit . If the pati ent has taken a SABA within 6 hours prior to the 
visit, the visit sho uld be rescheduled within 1 to 2 days as possible . However, patients 
are permitted to use a SABA if its use is abso lutely necessary  during the visit, and wit h 
the approval o f the Invest igator.
 Restrictions on medicat ions (prescribed or over -the-counter products) are defined in

WOCBPshoul d be stable on their chosen method of highly  effect ive birth control for a 
minimum o f 3months pri or to Visit 1 , and willing to use this for the ent ire duration of  
the study  (from the time they  sign the inform ed consent), and for 1 month after the last 
dose of IP. With the except ion of abst inence, it is recommended that male partners of 
enrolled women addit ionally  use a condom  during the durati on of  the st udy. Highly 
effect ive methods of birth control are defined as those which result in a low failure rate 
(ie, less than 1% per y ear) when used consistent ly and correctly. These include:
Female sterilisat ion (ie, docum ented bilateral  tubal ligat ion)
Horm onal methods of contraception associated with inhibit ion of ovulation 
(including levonorgestrel intrauterine system [eg, Mirena™], 
medroxyprogesterone injections [eg, Depo Provera™], etonogestrel implants [eg, 
Implanon™, Norplan™], normal and low dose combined oral pills, 
norel gestromin/ethinylestradiol transdermal system, intravaginal device [eg, 
ethinylestradio l and etonogestrel], an d desogestrel  [eg, Cerazette™])
An intrauterine device (IUD) (provided co ils are copper -banded)
True abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifest yle of the 
patient) and m ale sterilisat ion (if only one sexual partner, with the appropriate 
post-vasectomy documentation o f the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). Periodic 
abstinenc e (eg, cal endar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal  are not acceptabl e methods of contraception. 
Women will  be considered postmenopausal if the following age -specific requirements 
apply:
Women under 50 y ears of age woul d be c onsider edpostm enopausal  if they have 
been amenorrheic for 12 months or more fo llowing cessat ion of exogenous hormonal 
treatm ents AND with luteinizing hormone ( LH)andfollicle -stimulat ing hormone 
(FSH)levels in the post menopausal range.
Women over 50 y ears of age woul d be considered postmenopausal if they  have been 
amenorrheic for 12 m onths or more fo llowing cessati on of  all exogenous horm onal 
treatm ents.
Women who are considered to be postmenopausal without documentation of 12 -month 
amenorrhea and receiv ing horm one replacement therapy  (HRT ),will have to use one of 
the non -horm onal highly -effective contraception methods in addit ion to HRT ,or 
discontinue HRT and to use hormonal highly -effective method for at least 3 month s
prior to Visit 1 .
Male patients will be advised in the informed consent of the potential risk to

partner i s over 50 years of age and have been amenorrheic for 12 months or m ore 
following cessat ion of all exogenous hormonal treatments or are surgically sterile. Male 
patients m ust refrain from  donating sperm from the first day  of dosing unt il 90days after 
the last dose of IP .
3.10 Discontinuation of investigational product
Patients maybe di scontinued from the invest igational product ( IP)in the fo llowing situat ions:
 Patient wi thdrawal: The pat ient is free to discont inue treatment at any  time, wi thout 
prejudice to further treatm ent.A patient who decides to discont inue the IP will always 
be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. If possible, they  will be seen 
and assessed by  an Invest igator(s) . AEswill be fo llowed up (See Section 6.3) and all 
study  drugs shoul d be returned by  the pati ent.
 AE(including asthma exacerbat ions): If a pat ient experiences an AE, their premature 
discontinuat ion will  be considered at the di scret ion of eit her the Invest igator or the 
patient regardl ess of the causal relat ionship to the IP .AE should be indicated as the 
reason for discont inuat ion.
 Development of protocol -specific criteria ; In these cases, patients must be discont inued 
from the IP:
Patient wi th any asthma -specific withdrawal criteria described below:
(a)≥12puffs of rescue med icationfor ≥3consecut ive days
(b)Decrease fro m baseline in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF)by ≥30% for 
≥3consecut ive days (baseline defined as mean peak flow over the last week of 
Run-in Period)
(c)Decrease fro m baseline in evening PEF by ≥30% for ≥3 consecut ive days 
(baseline defined as mean peak flow over the last week of Run -in Period)
(d)ACQ -5 ≥3.0at any time during the study
(e)Clinical asthma exacerbat ion requiring increased dose of ICS or systemic 
steroi ds or hospi talisation for asthma exacerbat ion
Patient wi th prolonged QTcF >450 ms or an incr ease from  baseline (Visit 3 
pre-dose) of >60 ms, confirmed (persistent for at least 5 min)
Note: If any of these condit ions have been reported as AE, then this AE should be 
the primary  reason for di scontinuati on reported into the electroni c Case Report 
Form  (eCRF ).

46 (122 ) Protocol  deviat ion: After rando misation , any protocol  deviat ions detected should be 
corrected when possible and the patient should be allowed to continue .The fo llowing 
will lead to discont inuat ion of treatment: protocol deviat ions that coul d affect patient’s 
safet y (eg, illness requiring treat ment(s) which in the clinical judgement of the 
Invest igator [or after discussion wit h the study medi calmonitor] might invalidate the 
study  by interfering wi th the IP); deviat ions due to patient non -compliance wi th the 
study  protocol .
 Failure to meet rando misat ion criteria: Vi olations of  inclusion and/or exclusio n criteria 
detected after randomisat ion.See Secti on 3.5for pati ents not fulfilling 
inclu sion/excl usion criteria but detected after randomisat ion.
 Lost to follow -up/Non-attendance :In these cases, every effort should be made by the 
Invest igator to ascertain the reason and to assure the patient’s attendance as soon as 
possible .Every  effort (at least 3 documented attempts) should be made to contact the 
patient and will be docum ented in the m edical records .If the patient c annot be reached 
after that, a registered mail letter will be sent to the patient and will be docum ented in 
the medical records.
 Pregnancy: In case of pregnancy ,the pati ent will be immediately  discontinued from  the 
study  (see Sect ion 6.6.1 ).
 Patient wi thdrawal due to death.
 Other: Study  cancellat ion or any  other reason not described above.
Generally before discont inuat ion of a patient from the study , a discussio n between the 
PAREXEL Medical Monitor and theInvestigator is encouraged, as much as feasible.
3.10.1 Procedures for discontinuation of a patient from investigational product 
At any time, patients are free to discontinue theIPor wi thdraw from  the study  (ie, IPand 
assessments –see Section 3.12), without prejudice to further treatment .A patient that deci des 
to discont inue IPwill always be asked about the reason(s) and t he presence of any AE s.If 
possible, they  will be seen and assessed by an Investi gator(s) in an Early Terminat ion Visit .
AEswill be fo llowed up (See Secti on6.3.2 ); eDiary and study  drugs shoul d be returned by the 
patient.
3.11 Criteria for withdrawal 
3.11.1 Screen failures 
Screening failures are patients who do not fulfil the eligibilit y criteria for the study , and 
therefore m ust not be randomis ed.For t hese patients, the reason for study  withdrawal  shoul d 
be recorded as ‘Screen f ailure’ (ie, the patient does not meet the requi red inclusi on/exclusi on
criteria).This reason for study  withdrawal is only valid f or screen failures (not randomis ed 
patients).

47 (122 )3.11.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time ( IP administration andstudy
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment.
If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated bio logical samples, the pati ent is 
withdrawn from  further study  parti cipat ion, as collection of the bio logical samples is an 
integral  part of the study .This does not apply for withdrawal o f consent for Gxsample.
A patientwho withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any AE .The Invest igator will fo llow-up AEs outside of t he clinical study .The pat ient will 
return the eDiary  as well as the IP .
If a patient withdraws fro m participat ion in the study , then his/her enrolment/randomisat ion 
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients willnot be replaced.
Regardless of the reason for terminat ion, all data available for the patient at the time of 
discontinuat ion of fo llow-up m ust be recorded in the eCRF .All reasons for withdrawal o f 
consent must be documented.
3.12 Discontinuation of the study
The study  may be stopped if, in the judgement of AstraZeneca, trial pat ients are placed at 
undue risk because o f clinically significant findings that:
 Meet individual stopping criteria or are otherwise considered significant 
 Are assessed as causally related to study  drug,
 Are not consi dered to be consistent with cont inuat ion of the study
Regardless of the reason for terminat ion, all data available for the patient at the time of 
discontinuat ion of fo llow-up m ust be recorded in the eCRF. All reasons for discont inuat ion of 
treatm ent m ust be docum ented.
In terminat ing the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate considerat ion is given to the 
protecti on of  the pati ents’ interests.

conducti ng the spiro metry for thi s clinical study . SABA rescue m edicati on 
(salbutamo l/albuterol )shoul d be wi thheld at l east 6 hours before any pulmo nary function 
tests.
The spiro metry measurements are:
 FEV 1(volume of air expressed in litres exhaled during the first second of performance 
of the FVC)
 FVC (m aximal vol ume of ai r exhaled in li tres wi th maximally forced expiratory  effort 
from a posi tion of  maximal inspiration) 
The ci rcumstances around a patient’ s tests should be similar i n all occasio ns wit h respect to 
time of the day , tem perature as well as the technician, as much as possible.
Spirometry testing shoul d be co mpleted within a consistent time window relat ive to the time 
of the baseline assessment ± 2 hours to avoi d the influence of diurnal variabilit y. 2spirometry 
measurements 30 minutes apart from each other should be done at 45 minutes (allowed time 
window: 35 to 55 minutes) and 15 minutes before IP administration (allowed time window: 
5to 30 minutes) at each treatment visit.
The ATS and ERS guidelines (American Thoracic Societ y Official Documents, 20 05)shoul d 
be followed to provi de acc urate a nd comparable spirometry data.The s pirometer will be 
configured to meet ATS/ERS recommendat ions for accuracy  and precisio n (Miller et al, 
2005 ).The computeri sed spiro meter will check the consistency between tests and some of the 
requi rements set out in the ATS/ERS spirometry  guidelines, and will automatically  alert the 
technician to the presence of so me deviations fro m ATS/ERS requirements .However, 
technicians must ensure that the tests are performed with the correct technique .Technicians 
must use their judgement to ensure that the optimum spiro metry data is gained fro m the 
patient at each test sessio n.
These data will be electronically  transmi tted by the Invest igator to ERT typically at the end of 
each patient ’sprotocol  visit.Throughout the study , a centralised reading of spirometr yvalues 
will be performed by  independent spi rometry expert sat ERT, blinded to patient’s IP 
allocat ion and i dentity.A 2-step qualit y control will be done, as fo llows:
 “Over-Read” process: The first review of the spirometry  data (i ncluding review of tests 
rejected by  the technician) to verify that spirometry  curves are according to ATS/ERS 
criteria.No changes will be ma de to the patient’s data.
 “Best Test Review” process: During this procedure, the acceptabilit y of the “best effort” 
is assessed first, fo llowed by repeatabilit y.If quali ty problems are encountered on the 
spirometry curve pre -ident ified as the “best effort ”, ERT will check if there is another 
curve that is acceptable within the measurement .If another spiro metry curve is available 
that meets the acceptabilit y standards, the current “best effort” will be deselected and the 
Clinical Study Protocol

61 (122 )curve with the highest value specif ied according to the parameter will beco me the “best 
effort” for the measurement .This new “best effort” will represent the “best test” in all 
analysis and reporting for the patient .A report will be sent to the Invest igator indicating 
the change in “best test” with the reasons for the change .The Invest igator will sign the 
report and store it along with their source documentation. The Invest igator can contest 
the “best test” change by contacting the study  medical m onitor and following the 
rejection process.
Prior to the first spi rometry , a trained technician should demonstrate the procedure to the 
patient by  using a detached mouthpiece and allow practice attempts .Demonstration should be 
repeated and the patient should practise the procedure as many  times d uring the study course 
as deemed necessary .Care shoul d be taken to allo w the patient sufficient time to rest between 
efforts so that they  do not becom e excessively fatigued so that spiro metry data qualit y is 
impacted.
Patients who are unable to produce ac ceptable spirometry  tests m ust not be included in the 
study .The pat ient should be co mfortable before the test; tight clothing should be loosened to 
allow the thorax to move freely. Each m anoeuvre com prises 1 “set of tests”: at least
3measurements (curves ) that are technically  adequate are needed according to the 
acceptabilit y and repeatabilit y criteria of the ATS/ERS spi rometry guidelines .If both the 
acceptabilit y and repeatabilit y criteria are met, and the data are considered optimal for the 
specific pat ient, the manoeuvre sessio n can conclude after 3 measurements .If 1 or both of 
these cri teria are not m et, or the data generated are not consistent with the patients normal 
optimal efforts with no pot ential to improve then, a maximum of 5 addit ional tests (up to a 
total of 8tests) should be performed unt il either both cri teria are m et, unl ess the pati ent is ti red 
and cannot provide any  further useful data.
The operator performing the spiro metry must p rint every spiro metry test.The responsible 
Invest igator will need to review, sign and date the printouts .
Details on restrict ions pri or to l ung f unction testing are available in Sect ion 3.9. 
5.1.2 Secondary efficacy assessments
Use of eDiary : At Visi t 1, pati ents will  receive an eDi ary (AM3 Di ary provi ded by  ERT) to 
complete during the study .Patients will be provided training on the use of eDiary . During the 
Run-in and Treatment Period, patients will report their daily asthma symptoms, rescue 
medicat ion intake (number of puffs/day) ,budesonide intake, PEF flow (morning and 
evening), and night -time awakening (m orning, on a daily  basis). During the Treatmen t Peri od, 
patients will  report thei r intake of IP on a daily basis. Compliance as measured by eDiary 
shoul d be ≥80% in the Run -in Period and is expected to be ≥80% during the Treatment 
Period.
While at the study  centre at Vi sits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, patients will co mplete the ACQ -5 
within the AM3.

The validated ACQ -5 measures both the adequacy  of asthma control  and changes in asthma 
control .Patients are asked to recall how their asthma was during the previous week and to
evaluate their symptoms. The questionnaire has 5 items ( Appendix B); each item is scored on 
a scale of 0 to 6, where higher scores represent more seve re impairment/symptoms. The 
overall ACQ -5 score i s the average of the scores for each of the questions included in the 
questionnaire.
The ACQ- 5 will  be filled in by the patient on site (ACQ -5 is incl uded in the eDi ary and can be 
activated on site via a password).
5.1.2.2 Fractional exhaled nitric o xide
To investigate the effect of AZD7594 on airway inflammat ion, the measurement of F ENO will  
be perform ed in accordance with ATS/ERS guidelines ( American Thoracic Society  Official 
Docum ents, 20 05).Standardis ed condi tions wi th regard to exhalat ion flow rate and durati on 
of exhalati on will  be followed such that pl ateau definit ion can be evaluated over a minimum 
of 3seconds. The concentration of F ENO will be measured in unit s of ppb.
5.1.2.3 Peak expiratory flow
Peak expiratory  flow will  be measured by the pat ient at hom e after com pleting morning and 
evening diary  using a peak flow meter (AM3 device will be provided by  ERT) during the 
Run-in and Treatment Period. Patients will be provided with a device at Visit 1 and receive 
training on peak flow monitoring at that time.
The PEF m easurem ent m ust be done immediately  upon waking up, after the patient has 
cleared out m ucus and before inhaling the IP and any rescue medicat ion.The evening 
measurement should be done just before going to bed. The measurements should be made 
while standing and the best of 3 attempts should be recorded in eDiary .Patients will  have 
peak flow reviewed at study  visit s, and can be o ffered re -training if there are any concerns 
with the technique.
5.1.2.4 Rescue medication use
Patients will  be provi ded wi th a SABA (salbutam ol/albuterol ), asrescue medicat ion, to be 
used as needed, starting from Visit 1.Patients w ill be pr ovided wi th an eDiary  at Vi sit 1and

A brief physical examinat ion will be performed at Visit 3 and will include an assessment of 
the following: general  appearance, l ung, cardi ovascul ar system , lymphat ic nodes, abdomen, 
musculoskeletal system, neurological system, skin, mouth, and throat will be performed.
Body  weight and height will be measured at Visit 1 (Screening) for calculat ion of BMI .
Patients shoul d be in light indoor clothes without shoes. Body  weight will be measured again 
at Vi sit 7.
Throughout the study , clinically relevant new findings or worsen ing of a pre -exist ing 
condi tion from the medical history /physical  examinat ion must be considered an AE and must 
be recorded on the AE form o f the eCRF.
5.2.3 ECG
Standard digital ECG evaluat ions will be recorded after approximately 5 minutes resting in 
supine po sition and before any  blood sam pling and spi rometry  test.Digital ECGs will be 
recorded preferably  always by  the same technician for each patient.
ERT, as the responsible company  for the centralised el ectrocardi ographic assessments, will 
provi de the resear ch sites with the MasterScope equipment and supplies, specific training and 
written instructi ons.
Following an acquisit ion of a qualit y ECG tracing, the Invest igator or designee will 
electroni cally transfer the data to ERT.

Invest igators will assess pat ients’ eligibilit y according to the ECG report of Visit1 and 
Visit 3.
Any abnormal finding in the ECG tracing will be evaluated by  the Invest igator and will be 
specific ally docum ented and registered i n the eCRF.
Throughout the study, clinically relevant new findings or worsening of a pre -exist ing finding 
in the ECGs (parameters or abnormal findings in the tracing) must be conside red an AE and 
must be recorded i n the AE eCRF form .For informat ion on how AEs based on ECG results 
shoul d be recorded and reported, see Section 6.3.
In case of technical problems, the Investigator considers any result is clinically r elevant or 
doubtful, addit ional digitalECGs may be performed, using the same equipment, within a 
reasonable time.
5.2.4 Vital signs
The vital signs to be assessed (prior to IP administration )are blood pressure and pulse rate
measurements.
For informat ion on how AEs based on vital signs should be recorded and reported, see 
Secti on6.3.
5.2.4.1 Blood pressure
Systolic and di astolic blood pressure (in mm Hg) will be measured after at least 5 minutes 
resting, and before taking any  blood sam ple and conduct ing any spiro metry.Measurements 
will be carried out with the patient in a seated position and preferably always on the same arm .

The value obtained on the second measurement will be considered as definit ive and will be the 
one recorded on the eCRF.
5.2.5 Adverse events
Procedures for recording an d assessing AEs are included in Sect ion 6.3.
5.2.6 Unscheduled tests
As deemed necessary  by the Invest igator, additional safet y test(s) can be performed at any  
time during the study  in order to follow -up the progress of any  clinically rel evant abnormal 
finding, or to invest igate any potential new AE .These addit ional tests out of the init ial 
schedule of the study  will not be associated with any  study  visit.
5.2.7 Repeated tests
Any safet y test m ay be repeated at the Invest igator’s discret ion when t here is any kind of 
probl em with the fi rst test (i e, technical problem wit h the ECG machine, blood sample 
haemo lysed, presence of artefacts, etc.) .The Investigator should repeat the individual test as 
soon as possible, prior to the next visit.
The repeate d tests will be associated with the same visit as the first attempt.
5.3 Reversibility testing
Airflow reversibilit y is not an outcome variable .Baseline reversibilit y testing will  be 
perform ed at Visit 2 , whi ch can so metimes co incide with Visit 1 ( for more de tails see 
Secti on1.4).
Reversibilit y testing will include a pre -SABA spirometry , followed by  administrati on of  
4puffs ofSABA by  oral inhalati on (salbutam ol/albuterol ) and spiro metry testing
approximately 15 to 30 minutes after inhalati on SABA.If the reversibilit y criterion is not 
fulfilled, spiro metry measurements can be repeated one time, wi thin30 to 60 minutes 
post-SAB A administration.
The reversibilit y test will  be considered posi tive if pati ents show increase of FEV 1≥12% and 
≥200 mL after administration of SABA .
Details on restrict ions pri or to l ung f unction testing are available in Sect ion 3.9. 
5.4 Secondary objectives: Pharmacokinetics
Only selected sites that are capable of doing qualit y PK (and corti sol) sampling will 
participate in the PK subset. PK subset will include only pat ients who are assigned to 
AZD7594 or placebo treatment arms. Only pat ients who si gn a separate ICF (PK and PD ICF) 
will part icipate in the PK sub set. Approximately 20 patients per treatment arm (AZD7594 or 
placebo) are planne dto participate in PK sampling fro m the selected sites.

5.4.1 Collection of samples
Blood sam ples f or PK analysis will be collected from  patients parti cipat ing in the PK subset at 
the time points (3mL at each time po int) detailed in Table 2.
Samples will  be collected, l abelled stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory  Manual.
5.4.2 Determination of drug concentration
Samples for thedeterminat ion of AZD7594 concentrati on in pl asma will be analysed by  
Covance on behalf o f AstraZeneca, using a validated bioanalyt ical method .Full details of the 
analyt ical method used will be described i n a Bioanaly tical Report separate from the clinical 
study  report (CSR).
Results will only  be reported for samples shipped within a t imeframe for which the stabilit y of 
AZD7594 in the samples has been validated and shown to be acceptable.
Samples fro m patients assigned to p lacebo will only be analysed if there is cause to expect 
incorrect study  drug administrati on.
5.4.3 Storage and destruction of pharmacokinetic samples
Pharmacokinet ic (PK) samples will be disposed of after the Bioanalyt ical Report finali sation
or 6months after issuance of the draft Bioanalyt ical Report (whi chever is earlier), unless 
requested for future analyses.
Pharmacokinet ic samples may be disposed of or destroyed and anonymised by pooling .
Addit ional analyses m ay be conducted on the an onymised, pool ed PK samples to further 
evaluate and validate the analyt ical method .Any results fro m such analyses may be reported 
separately  from the CSR.
Incurred sample reproducibilit y analysis, if any , will  be perform ed al ongside the bioanalysis 
of thetest samples .The results from the evaluation will not be reported in the CSR but 
separately  in a Bi oanaly tical Report.
5.5 Secondary objectives: Pharmacodynamics
24-hour cortisol measurement: As a measure of cortiso l suppressio n, 24 -hourplasma 
cortisol meas urements will be performed in the same subset of patients as PK sampling and a 
selected subset of FF treated patients . Only pat ients who si gn a separate ICF (PK and PD ICF) 
will part icipate in this subset. The targeted sample size for cortiso l sampling is approximately  
20 pati ents per arm . Plasma cortisol  will be measured j ust before and at the end of the 
Treatment Period. Measurement before the first dose will serve as a baseline value (pati ents 
will be required to stay  overnight for 24 hours before IP adm inistrati on on Day 1 and for 
24 hours after the l ast dose on Day  84). Blood sam pling will occur on Day  −1 (at −24, −22,

2 mL of blood at each sampling time po int will be collected for the plasma cortiso l 
bioanalysis .
Samples for determination of cortiso l concentrati onin plasma will be analysed by Covance on 
behalf AstraZeneca using appropriate bioanaly tical methods. Full details o f the analy tical 
methods will be described in a separate Bioanaly tical Report.
Samples will  be collected, l abelled, stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory  Manual.
5.6 Exploratory objectives: Pharmacogen omics sub -study
5.6.1 Collection of optional genom ic samples
The patient’s consent to participate in the geno micresearch co mponents of the study is 
optional. 
Ablood sample for genomic research will be obtained fro m thepatients at Visit 3, ie, after
rando misat ion, but pri or to IPadministration , and only  after pati ents agree and sign the 
additional genomic s ICF. Although DNA variants are stable parameters , early  sample 
collect ion is preferred to avo id int roducing bias t hrough excluding patients who m ay withdraw 
due to an AE, such patient would be important to include in any geno micanalysis. If for any  
reason the sample is not drawn at Visit 3, it may be taken at any visit unt il the last study visit.
Only one sample should be co llected per patient for genomic s during the study . 
Samples will  be collected, l abelled, stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory  Manual.
5.6.2 Storage and destruction of genomic samples
The processes adopted for the coding an d storage of samples for geno micanalysis are 
important to maintain patientconfident iality.Sampl es wil l be stored for a maximum o f 
15years or as per local regulations fro m the date of the Last Subject’s Last Visit, after which 
they will be destroy ed.DNA is a finite resource that may be used up during analyses. The 
resul ts of any possible future analyses will not be reported in the CSR, but separately  in a 
scientific report or publicat ion.
No personal details identifying the individual will be available to AstraZeneca or designated 
organi sations working with the DNA .

6. SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEM ENT
The P Iis responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study  are f amiliar with the 
content of this sect ion.
The Investigator will closely mo nitor any  AE and will adopt the necessary  clinical measures 
to ensure the safet y of the patients until the resolut ion of the AEs.
6.1 Definition of adverse events
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condit ion or the deteri oration of  a 
pre-exist ing medical condi tion following or during exposure to a pharmaceut ical product, 
whether or not considered causally  related to the product. An undesirable medical condit ion 
can be symptoms (eg, nausea, chest pain), signs (eg, tachy cardi a, enlarged liver) or the 
abnorm al resul ts of an investi gation (eg, l aboratory findings, ECG). In clini cal studi es, an AE 
can include an undesirable medical condit ion occurring at any  time, including Run-inor 
wash -out peri ods, even if no study  treatm ent has been administered.
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs.
6.2 Definitions of s erious adverse event
A SAE is an AE occurring during any study  phase (i e, screening, treatment, fo llow-up), that 
fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
 Results in death
 Is immediately life -threatening
 Requi res in -patient hospi talisat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talisat ion 
 Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y or substantial disrupt ion of the 
abilit y to conduct normal life funct ions
 Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defec t
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance AZD7594
Study Code D3741C00007
Version 2.0
Date 26 April 2019
73 (122 ) Is an important medical event that may jeopardi ze the patient or m ay requi re medical 
intervent ion to prevent o ne of the outcomes listed above
For further guidance on the definit ion of a SAE, see Appendix G.
6.3 Recording of adverse events
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events
AEs will be co llected fro m the time of signature of informed consent thro ughout the Run-in, 
as well as the Treatment peri od and including the follow -up peri od (Foll ow-up Contact or 
Early Terminat ion Visit).
6.3.2 Follow -up of unresolved adverse events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment in the study  will be fo llowed 
up by  the Invest igator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the 
eCRF .AstraZeneca retains the right to request addit ional inform ation for any  patient with 
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessary .
6.3.3 Variables 
The fo llowing vari ables will be collected for each AE:
 AE (verbat im)
 The date when the AE started and stopped
 Maximum intensit y
 Whether the AE is serious or not
 Invest igator causalit y rating against the IP (y es or no)
 Action taken with regard to IP
 AE caused pat ient’s withd rawal from  study  (yes or no)
 Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
 Date AE m et cri teria for SAE
 Date Invest igator became aware of SAE
 AE is seri ous due to (ie, seri ousness cri teria)
 Date of hospitalisat ion
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance AZD7594
Study Code D3741C00007
Version 2.0
Date 26 April 2019
74 (122 ) Date of discharge
 Probable cause of death
 Date of death
 Autopsy  performed
 Causa lity assessment in relat ion to s tudy procedure(s)
 Causalit y assessment in relat ion to other medicat ion
 Descript ion of AE
For grading the intensit y of an AE, the fo llowing intensit y rating scale will be used:
1. Mild: awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated (acceptable)
2. Moderate: disco mfort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities 
(disturbing)
3. Severe: incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform  norm al activities (unac ceptable)
AEswill be recorded only  once wi th their maximum  intensity.
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs .Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by the criteria in Sect ion6.2.An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considere d a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal re lationship between IP administration and each AE, and
answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consider that there is a reasonable possibilit y that 
the event may have been caused by the IP?’
For SAEs ,causal relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures .
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any  study  procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix G.

75 (122 )6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the pati ent or their care provider or reported in response to 
the open question from the study  personnel: ‘Have y ou had any  heal th problems since the 
previous visit/y ou were l ast asked?’ , or revealed by  observati on will be collected and recorded 
in the eCRF .When co llecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to 
recording a list of signs and symptom s.However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other 
signs or symptom s that are not generally  part of  the di agnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom  will be recorded separately .
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results fr om the Clinical  Study  Protocol -mandated l aboratory  tests and vi tal signs will be 
summarised in the CSR. Deteri oration as com pared to baseline in protocol -mandated 
laboratory  test val ues and vi tal signs shoul d therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfi l 
any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuat ion of treatment with the IP.
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated lab oratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion.Wherever possible the reporting Invest igator 
uses the clinical, rat her than the laboratory term (e g, anaemia versus low haemoglo bin value). 
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms , clinically  relevant deteri orations in non -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Deteri oration of  a laboratory  value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE
6.3.7 Hy’s Law
Cases where a patient shows elevat ions in liver bio chemistry  may require further evaluat ion 
and occurrences o f AST or AL T ≥3×ULN together with TBL ≥2×ULN may  need to be 
reported as SAEs .Please refer to Appendix Dfor further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry  and evaluat ion of Hy’s Law.
6.3.8 Disease under study 
Asthma symptoms or signs, such as wheeze, cough, chest tightness, dy spnoea , breathlessness 
and phlegm, will be recorded as AEs when:
 The sign or symptom is serious according to definitions, and/or
 The patient discont inues the study due to the sign or symptom and/or
 The sign or symptom is new to the patient or not consistent with the pati ent’s pre -
exist ing asthma history  (defined as within 1 y ear of Visit 1) as j udged by  the Invest igator

76(122)Events, which are unequivocally due to the disease under study  shoul d not be reported as an 
AE during the study  unless they  meet SAE cri teria or lead to discont inuat ion of the IP.
6.4 Reporting of serious adverse events
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the 
study  procedure(s) .All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF .A paper SAE form will be 
availab le at the study  centre s in case the EDC is temporarily unavailable.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study , then Invest igators or other site personnel will
inform  the appropri ate AstraZeneca representatives or designee within one day  ie, 
immediately but no later than 24 hours of when they beco me aware of it .
The designated AstraZeneca representative or designee will work wi th the Investi gator to 
ensure that all the necessary  information is provi ded to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data 
entry  site (DES) within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life -threatening events 
and within 5 calendar days of initialreceipt for all other SAEs .Therefore all information 
relevant to the SAEs should be collected and entered as soon as possible.
For fatal  or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant informat ion is missing, active 
follow-up will be undertaken immed iately .Invest igators or other site personnel will inform  
AstraZeneca representatives or designee o f any fo llow-up inform ation on a previously  
reported fatal or life -threatening SAE within 1 calendar day  ie, immediately  butno later than 
24hours of when h e or she beco mes aware of it .
Once the Invest igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an 
autom ated e -mail alert will besent to the desi gnated AstraZeneca representative or designee.
If the EDC system is not available, t hen the Invest igator or other study  centre personnel will 
report a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative or designee by e -mail/fax using 
the study -specific paper form , within one calendar day .
The AstraZeneca representative or designee will adv ise the Invest igator/ study  centre
personnel how to proceed.
In Europe, the reference document for definit ion of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the 
AstraZeneca drug andfor the active comparator product FF.
6.5 Overdose
Any dose above the investigated dose should be considered an overdose .There is no 
experience wit h overdose and no data regarding overdose with AZD7594 are available fro m 
clinical studies .However, overdose would likely  lead to effects that are ty pical  of GR 
agonists .
There i s no known a ntidote to AZD7594 .In cases of known or suspected overdose, 
symptom atic treatment and monitoring of vital functions should be performed according to

Version 2.0
Date 26 April 2019
77 (122 )routi ne clinical pract ice.Immediate discontinuation of the drug should be performed, and 
appropriate symp tomatic therapy should be inst ituted.
 An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE m odules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
 An overdose without associated symptoms is only  reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module.
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study  drug occurs in the course of the study , then the 
Invest igator or other site personnel will inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives 
immediately , or no l ater than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes a ware of i t.
The designated AstraZeneca representative will work wi th the Invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca PatientSafet y DES .
For overdose events associ ated wi th a SAE, the standard reporti ng timelines app ly, see 
Secti on6.4.For other overdose events , reporting must occur within 30 days.
6.6 Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca .
6.6.1 Maternal exposure
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study , the IP should be discont inued 
immediately .If a female pat ient, or the female partner of a male pat ient, who has received IP 
beco mes pregnant ,the preg nancy will be recorded.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AEunless there is a suspicio n that the IPunder study  
may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion.Congenital 
abnorm alities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarria ges shoul d be reported and handled as 
SAEs. Elective abortions wit hout complicat ions should not be handled as AEs. The outcom e 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth or congenital abnormalit y) sho uld be fo llowed up and docum ented even if the patient
was discont inued from the study .
If any pregnancy  occurs during the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site 
personnel will inform  the appropri ate AstraZeneca representatives wit hin 1 calendar day ie, 
immediately but no later than 24 hours ofwhen he or she beco mes aware of it according to 
the safet y reporting procedure stated in Section 6.4.
The designated AstraZeneca representative will work wi th the Invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca PatientSafet y DES within 1 or 5 calendar 
days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and wi thin 30 days for all other pregnancies.

will be reported in a specific form in the eCRF and the outcome of pregnancy will be reported 
through a paper form (or eCRF, if available) .
6.6.2 Paternal exposure 
In case of pregnancy o f the pati ent’s partner, the participant will not be nec essarily  
discontinued fro m the study  but the partner’s pregnancy should be reported on the pregnancy  
form (consent fro m the partner m ust be obtained before the pregnancy  form is completed) 
following the same timeframe and routing as described for any  parti cipant’s pregnancy .
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE .These pregnancies will also 
be followed up, and the outcome of the pregnancy  (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive 
termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnorm ality) shoul d,if possible ,be 
obtained and documented.
6.6.3 Time period for the collection of pregnancy information
All pregnancies in female patients or the female partners of male patients, receiving at least 
one administration of the IP will be recor ded from first dose to 1 month after the final IP 
administration .Pregnancies of the female partner of male participants are only required to be 
recorded when the male patient rece ived the AZD7594/placebo double -blind treatm ent.
6.7 Medi cation e rror
For the pu rposes of this clinical study ,a medicati on error i s an unintended failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the patient 
or has the potential to cause harm to the patient .
A medicat ion error is no t lack of efficacy  of the drug, but rather a human or process rela ted 
failure while the drug is under control  of the study  centre staff or patient.
Medicat ion errors include situations where an error :
Occurred
Was i dentified and intercepted before the patient received the drug
Did not occur, but circumstances were recognis edthat coul d have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name confusio n
Dispensing error eg,medication prepared incorrectly ,even if i t was not actually  given to 
the pati ent
Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance AZD7594
Study Code D3741C00007
Version 2.0
Date 26 April 2019
79 (122 ) Drug not taken as indicated eg,tablet di ssolved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet 
 Drug not sto red as instructed eg,kept in the fridge when it should be at room 
temperature 
 Wrong patient received the medication (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
 Wrong drug administered to patient (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
Examples of events that do not require report ing as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
 Errors related to or resulting fro m IVRS/IWRS -including those which lead to one of 
the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medicat ion error 
 Patient acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) eg,forgot to take m edicat ion
 Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
 Patient failed to return unused medicat ion or em pty packaging
 Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in 
open -labelstudi es, even if an AZ product 
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may  occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.
If a medicat ion error occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site 
personnel will inform the appropri ate AstraZeneca r epresentatives wit hin 1 day ie, 
immediately  but no l ater than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is completed wi thin 1 o r 5calendar days if there is a SAE associ ated wi th 
the medicat ion error (see Section 6.4) and wi thin 30 day s for all other m edicat ion errors.
6.8 Management of IP related toxicities 
Not applicable.

Visit 1 (Vi sit3).
Patients found to be eligible at Visit 1 will discont inue all asthma medications and switch to 
low dose budesonide (200 µg BID in Europe and 180 µg BID in US). Visit 1 and Visit 2can 
occur the same day, unle ss the patient is taking a medicat ion that precludes reversibilit y 
testing, including LABA, fixed dose combi nation ICS/LABA treatment or a LAMA , in which 
case the patient will return for Visit 2within 2 -7 days after Visi t1to allow sufficient time to 
wash -out thei r asthm a medicat ions.
Reversibilit y will  be assessed at Visit 2. If reversibilit y criteria are met at Vi sit 2, patients will 
proceed to Visit 3. Randomisat ion will oc cur at Visit 3, within 21 to 28 days of Visit 1. At 
Visit3, pati ents who rem ain symptom atic while on low dose budesonide (as assessed by 
asthma m ean symptom  score > 1over the previous 7 day s or use of a SABA on≥3 days of the 
previous 7 days) and meet FEV 1criteria ( ≥40% to ≤90% predicted at either −45or 
−15minutes pre -dose) will be randomised to one of 7 possible treatm ent arm s (see below). If 
patients do not m eet eligibilit y (especially  symptom  criteria or l ung funct ion criteria) ,Visit 3 
can be repeated once within 1 week. If this occurs, addi tional budesonide may need to be 
provi ded to the patient to ensure that the patient has run -in medicat ion (budesonide) available 
throughout the run -in period .
7.2.3 Treatment period
This period will include 4 visit s (Vi sit 4 to Visi t 7) and will  last 12 weeks. Each p atient will  
start treatment with AZD7594, placebo to AZD7594 or FF. Treatment will start after the pre -
dose specified procedures and randomisat ion.Subsequent doses (after Visit 3) of IP will be 
taken at home at approximately the same time o f the day , withthe except ion of doses on study  
visit days (Visits 4 to 6 ), which will be taken at the study  centre .Patients assigned to FFarm 
will take this medicat ion once a day  at a daily  dose of 100 µg.Patients will take the last dose 
of the IP the day  prior to Vi sit 7, and resume thei r regul ar asthma therapy  at the com pletion of 
Visit7.
Further informat ion regarding theIP ki t will  be provi ded in the Invest igator drug manual.
7.3 Labelling

8.1 Statistical considerations
A fully detailed Statist ical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared by the Global Study
Statistician fro m PAREXEL before database lock .
All results will be presented by  treatm ent wi th descri ptive statist ics appropriate to the nature 
of the variables .Dem ographic and baseline characterist ics will be presented as fo llows; f or 
continuous variabl es, the number of non -missing observat ions, m ean, standard deviat ion(SD) , 
standard error (SE) of the mean, 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mean (except safet y 
data), m edian, fi rst and thi rd quarti les, minimum and maximum, will be presented ; for 
catego rical variables: counts (n) and percentages (%) (where specified) will be presented .
These summaries will be provided by time po int of assessment as appropriate .
The SAS®versio n 9.3or higher will be used for the data analysis. A complete set of raw data
listings will be appended to the final CSR .All tables, figures and list ings will be presented in 
portabl e document format ( PDF)documents without any manual edit ing, ie, they  will appear 
unmodified as programmed by means of the statistical package.
Detai ls on the handling of missing data for the safety  or efficacy analyses will be provided in
the SAP.
8.2 Sample size estimate
Approximately  102 patients will be rando mised to each arm (overall randomisat ion rati o 
1:1:1:1:1:1:1 )in order to ensure at least 86 ev aluable pat ients per arm .This sample size will

in change fro m baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 12 between each dose of AZD7594 and 
placebo, assuming an inter -patient SDof 405 mL, using a 2-sided test with a significance level 
of 0.05 and wi th anestimated 15% dropout rate .
The targeted total number of patients to be randomised is approximately  714patients.
Addit ional patients will be screened to accoun t for any ineligibilit y rate pri or to 
rando misat ion.From  previ ous studi es, the screening failure rate is estimated to be 
approximately  50%, therefore approximately  1400 -1500 screened patients will be required to 
achieve the goal of approximately 714rando mised pati ents.
8.3 Definitions of analysis sets
8.3.1 Full analysis set
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) population is defined as all pat ients randomised and receiving at 
least 1 dose of rando mised IP, irrespect ive of their protocol adherence and cont inued 
participat ion in the s tudy.Patients will  be analysed as randomised , irrespect ive of whether or 
not they  have prematurely discont inued .Patients who wi thdraw consent to participate in the 
study  will be included up to the date of their study  terminati on.All efficacy analyses wi ll be 
based on the FAS.
8.3.2 Safety analysis set
The Safety analysis set consists of all rando mised patients who received at least one dose of IP
and for whom any post -dose data are available .Patients will be analysed as treated . Any 
important deviat ions from the rando mised treatment assignment will be listed and considered 
when interpreting the safety  data .All safet y analyses will be based on the Safet yanalysis set.
8.3.3 Pharmacokinetic analysis set
The PK analysis set is defined as all rando mised patients participat ing in the PK sub set, who 
took at l east one dose of IP and for whom at least one of the primary  PK parameters can be 
calculated, and who have no major protocol deviatio ns considered to impact on the analysis o f 
the PK data ( eg, disallowed medicat ion, or incorrect study  medicat ion received) .All protocol 
deviat ions that occur during the study  will be considered for their severit y/impact and will be 
taken into consideration when pat ients are assigned to the PK analysis set.
The exclusio n of any  patients or time poi nts from the calculat ion of the PK parameters will be 
docum ented by  the PK scient ist including the reason(s) for exclusio n.The available 
concentration data and PK parameter data for any  patients excluded fro m the PK analysis set 
will be li sted only , and presented in the individual figures of concentration -time plots .
8.3.4 Pharmacodynamic analysis set
The pharmacodynamic analysis set is defined as all rando mised patients who took at least one 
dose of IP and for whom 24 -hour corti sol sampling was perform ed and baseline and

87(122)post-baseline AUEC (0-24)can be calculated, and who have no major protocol deviat ions 
considered to impact on the analysis of the PD data.
8.3.5 Per Protocol set
The Per Protocol (PP) populat ion is defined as a subset of the FAS popul ationconst ituted by  
those patients who did not present important deviatio ns of the protocol that may affect 
efficacy  (eg, m et all  inclusi on/exclusi on criteria liable to affect the efficacy  assessment).
8.3.6 Protocol deviations
Deviat ions from  the protocol  will be assessed as “important” by PAREXEL in conjunct ion 
with AstraZeneca .Important devi ations from the protocol  may lead to the exclusio n of 
patients f rom the PP set and/or other analysis sets .Deviat ions will be defined before database 
hard l ock and unblin ding.Important devi ations will include the fo llowing: 
Violation of incl usion and/or exclusio n criteria
Patients who developed withdrawal criteria during t he study but were not withdrawn
Wrong study  treatm entor incorrect dose administered
Administrati on of prohibi ted concomi tant m edicat ions that are expected to influence the 
measurement of the primary endpo int
All important protocol deviations will be listed by patient for all randomised patients .Further 
details will be described in the SAP.
A Blind Data Review Meet ing (BDRM) will be held before database hard lock and 
unblinding, in order to assign the patients to each of the analysis setsaccording to the 
specified definit ions.The precise reasons for excluding patients fro m the study  populati ons 
will be defined in the protocol  deviati on specification and documented in the BDRM minutes .
8.4 Outcome measures for analyses
8.4.1 Primary efficacy variable
The primary  variable is the change fro m baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 12.
Efficacy analysis will be based on the FAS popul ation that includes all rando mised pati ents 
who received at least 1 dose of rando mised study  drug .Patients will be included in the 
analysis according to the treatment to which they  were randomis ed.
Baseline for FEV 1will be defined as the mean o fthe 2measured values before first IP

2measurements is missing, the remaining one will be used as trough FEV 1instead.
8.4.2 Secondary efficacy variables
The secondary  efficacy variables are ACQ -5, FENO, morning and evening PEF, rescue 
medicat ion use, asthma symptom  score, night -time awakenings and daily symptoms as 
recorded in an eDiary .
In addit ion, secondary  efficacy assessment inclu des evaluat ingCompEx, a combinat ion of
severe exacerbat ions of asthma and di ary events (ie, combinat ion of eDiary  variables) .
Com pEx is a com posite surrogate endpoint for severe e xacerbat ions of asthma, recent ly 
developed by AstraZeneca (it is not y et a regul atory -approved clinical endpo int).Severe 
exacerbations are defined as those episodes that lead to hospitalisat ion, em ergency  room  visit 
and/or treatment with oral corticostero ids. Diary events are defined by threshold and slope 
criteria using the fo llowing Morning/Evening (am/pm) diary  variables:
 PEF
 Symptom  score (0 –3)
 Rescue use
Com pEx can pr edict treatm ent efficacy  on severe exacerbat ions in early development before 
running traditional long-term severe exacerbat ion trials. Com pEx can be used broadly  in the 
design of new therapeut ic intervent ions for asthma.
8.4.3 Pharmacokinetic variables
Where possible, the fo llowing (steady  state) PK parameters will be assessed for AZD7594 in a
subset of patients participat ing in the PK sub setand derived by standard non -compart mental 
analysis (NCA):
Css,max Observed maximum concentration at steady state, taken directly from the 
individual concentration -time curve
Css,min Observed minimum concentration at the end of the dosing interval
tss,max Time to maximum concentration at steady state, taken directly from the 
individual concentration -time curve
AUC last Area under the plasma concentration -curve from time zero to the time of last 
quanti fiable analyte concentration
AUC τ Area under the plasma concentration -curve within a dosing interval

The pl asma concentration -time data from patientsparticipat ing in the PK sub setmay be 
pooledwith other PK data to build a population PK model .PK m odelling will  be the 
responsibilit y of AstraZeneca and will be described in a separate Data An alysis Plan .The 
resul ts of any such modelling willbe reported outside the CSR.
8.4.4 Pharmacodynamic variables
The pharmacodynamics of AZD7594 will be assessed by measuring cortiso l suppressio n in 
the sam e subset of patients as PK sampling and a sel ected subset of FF treated patients .
Corti sol suppressio n will i mply the m easurement of the area under the plasma cortiso l 
concentra tion-time curve fro m zero to 24 hours after dosing (AUEC (0-24)) as com pared to 
placebo .
8.4.5 Exploratory variables
Exploratory  outcom es will include the use of FOT as a measure of small airways involvement,
biomarker analysis and a Gxanalysis.
No m ultiplicity adjustm ents will be done for secondary  or other efficacy  variables.

together with the corresponding assessments after baseline and wit h the changes fro m baseline 
to ease the interpretation of these safet y outcom es.
Appropriate descript ive statistics will be provided for these variables. No statist ical tests will 
be perform ed.
All demographic and baseline characterist ics, will be analysed using the FAS.
8.5.2 Analyses of prior and concomitant (including rescue medication )
Analyses of prior and conco mitant m edicat ion will be performed on the Saf ety analysis set. 
8.5.2.1 Prior medication
Prior medicat ion is defined as any medicat ion taken within 15 days before the ICF signature 
date and up to the first dose of IP.

signing up to IP i ntake) will be summarised overall by therapeut ic categories. Anatomical 
Therapeut ic Chemical Code (third level), and preferred name. Patients wi th multiple drug 
usage in the same preferred name will be counted only  once.
Addit ionally , a sub set of  the previ ous summary will be produced present ing the number and 
percentage of patients who used any prior medication for asthma within 15 days before the 
ICF signing up to first IP inta ke by  therapeut ic categories (e g,LABA + ICS). Therapeutic 
categ ories will  be defined in the SAP.
8.5.2.2 Concomitant medication
Concomitant medicat ion is defined as any medicati on taken during the study treatm ent 
durati on between the date of the first dose of study drug and the date of the last dose of study  
drug (inclusive). Any medicat ions started after the date of the last dose of double -blind study  
drug (AZD7594 or placebo) will not be considered concomitant medicat ions.
Concomitant medicat ions will be analysed based on 2periods: 1) m edicat ions that the patient 
started to take before the randomisat ion and cont inued after the first study  drug 
administration, and 2) medicat ions that the patient started to take during the double -blind 
treatm ent durati on.
Concomitant medicat ion will be summarised descript ively for the Safet y analysis set.
8.5.3 Analysis of the efficacy variable (s)
The analysis of all the efficacy variables will be performed on the FAS. In addit ion, the 
primary  efficacy  variable will also be analysed using the PP set. 
8.5.3.1 Primary efficacy variable
The primary  efficacy  variable, change from  baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 12 ,will be 
analysed by means of MMRM using all post -baseline visit trough FEV 1data throughout the 
treatm ent peri od(Visit 4/Week 2 –Visit 7/Week 12) . The m odel will include treatm ent, vi sit, 
treatm ent by visit interacti on, and region (US, Japan, and RoW ) as fixed effects as well as 
baseline FEV 1, and baseline FEV 1by visit interaction as covariates .This analysis will be 
based on the FAS (primary  analysis populati on) and the PP set (secondary  analysis
popul ation, sensi tivity analysis ).
The wi thin-patient correl ation will be modelled using the unstructured covariance matrix. The 
Kenward -Roger approximat ion will be used to estimate deno minator degrees of freedo m. The 
analysis will be performed using only the observed cases without imputation of missing 
values. If the model does not converge, then the compound symmetry  covariance structure 
will be used. Restricted maximum likelihood method will be applied .
Each treatment effect and treatment differences be tween all act ive treatments, administered 
once a day , versus placebo at each visit will be est imated by the Least Square (LS) means on 
the correspondent treatment byvisit interaction, along with their SE and 95% CI, and the

92(122)p-value corresponding to the between -treatm ent group difference. The comparison between 
active co mparator ( FF) and pl acebo i s used for bench marking.
A step -down closed testing procedure will be applied to control the overall type I error rate 
due to multiplicit y on the primary treatment comparisons for the primary  endpoint using the 
following hierarchy  for the primary  com parisons:
Change from baseline in trough FEV 1at Week 12 :
AZD7594 DPI 792 µg [nominal strength]/ 720 µg [delivered dose] QD versus pl acebo.
AZD7594 DPI 396 µg/ 360 µg QD versus placebo.
AZD7594 DPI 198 µg/ 180 µg QD versus placebo.
AZD7594 DPI 99 µg/ 90 µg QD versus placebo.
AZD7594 DPI 55 µg/ 50 µg QD versus placebo.
The previous dose will be required to be significant at the two-sided 0.05 level in order to 
infer on the following dose of this pre -defined hierarchy. If a given statist ical test fails to 
reject the null hypothesis of no treatment difference at the two-sidedsignificance level o f 
0.05, then all tests lower down in the hierarch y will be interpreted as descri ptive only .
In addit ion, the overall treatment effect and treatment difference over the double -blind 
treatm ent peri od will be est imated by the LS means and the difference in LS means on the 
treatm ent factor, al ong wi th the SE s, and 95% CIs and the p -value corresponding to the 
between -treatm ent group difference.
Subgroup analys es
Treatment effects will be evaluated for trough FEV 1at Week 12 in the fo llowing subgroup of 
patients:
% Predi cted FEV 1(≥40 to ≤65% or >65 to ≤90%) atVisit 3 (randomisation) .
Prior use of ICS (l ow/medium /high dose).
Smoking status (non -smoker, f ormer sm oker).
Region(US, Japan, and RoW) .
These variables will be analysed using similar MMRM as the primary  variable.

No m ultiplicity adjustm ents will be applied for the secondary  variables.
8.5.4 Analysis of p harmacokinetic variables
8.5.4.1 Calculation or derivation of the pharmacokinetic parameters
Pharmacokinet icanalyses will be performed by  Covance Clinical Pharmacokinet ic Alliance 
(CPKA) on behalf o f AstraZeneca R&D . (Steady  state) PK parameters will be derived using 
standard non -compartmental methods with Phoenix®Winno nlin®, versi on 6.3or higher. The 
PK analysis will be carried out, where possible, using actual times recorded in the raw data. If 
actual t imes are missing, no minal t imes may be used.
Pharmacokinet ic analyses will be conducted according to AstraZeneca guidelines for PK 
analyses, if not otherwise indicated.
Plasma concentrations below the lower limit of quant ificat ion (BLQ) from the time of 
pre-dose sampling (t=0) up to the time of the first quant ifiable concentration will be set to a 
value of 0. After this point, BLQ plasma concentrati ons will be set to missing for all 
concentration profiles. Also, if 2 or more consecutive BLQ concentrations are fo llowed by  
quant ifiable concentrations in the terminal portion of the concentration -curve, the profile will 
be deemed to have termi nated and therefore these quant ifiable values will be set to missing for 
the calculat ion of the PK parameters unless there is a sci entific rationale not to do so 
docum ented in the PK analysis notes.
If an entire concentration -time profile is BLQ, the profi le is excluded fro m the PK analysis. 
Area under the plasma concentration -curve will be calculated using trapezoidal methods when 
concentration is increasing and logarithmic trapezoidal method when concentrations are 
decreasing.
The minimum requirement for the calculat ion of AUC will be the inclusio n of at least 
3consecutive plasma concentrations above the lower limit of quantitation, with at least 1 of 
these concentrations fo llowing C max.

minimum and maximum based on the PK analysis se t. Plasma concentrati ons that are BLQ 
will be handled as described in the SAP.
Combined individual plasma concentration per dose level (spaghetti plots) will be presented in 
linear and semi -logarithmic scale with sep arate pl ots for each dose l evel.
Figures for the geom etric mean concentrati on-time data will be presented for all doses 
overl aid on the sam e plot, in both a linear and semi -logarithmic scale.
Addit ional graphical presentations of PK data may be added at the discretion of the PK

not in the descriptive statist ics or in the inferential statist ics.
Dose proporti onalit y of AZD7594 on Week 12 (Day  84)will be assessed graphically  and 
analysed using the power model approach w ith the natural logarithm of PK parameters ( Css,max
and AUC τon Week 12 /Day  84) as the dependent variable and the logarithm of the dose as the 
independent variable.
All descript ive and inferent ial statistical co mputations will be performed using SAS Versio n 
9.2, or hi gher. Graphics may be prepared with SAS®(Versi on 9.4 or hi gher).
Further details regarding the model specificat ions will be provided in the SAP.

assessment. The Investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRF are accurate and 
correct. If so me assessments cannot be done, or if certain informat ion is unavail able, not 
applicable, or unknown, the Invest igator should indicate this in the eCRF. 
After complet ion, the Invest igator will be required to electronically sign off the clinical data.
The Data Validat ion Specification (DVS) will be created by  PAREXEL and w ill contain 
details o f consistency and structural checks to be run against the data as well as list ings 
requi red for PAREXEL data cleaning and review.
Autom ated edi t checks with inDataLabs are available once the data has been entered and 
saved. Addit ionalqueries will also be ident ified during the study via list ing review by 
PAREXEL personnel. These include queries relat ing to clinical data coding, external vendor 
data etc. Queries for data inconsistences or clarifications will be issued within the eCRF an d 
updates will be made by the appropriate trained sit e personnel.
Database, edit checks, list ings (programmed for data review) and any programming implying 
data conversio ns will be appropriately  validated by PAREXEL.
Data queri es will be raised for inconsi stent orimpossible data. All entries to the study 
database will be available in an audit trail.
Clinical coding
AEs and m edical /surgical  history  will be classified according to the termino logy of the 
Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) .Medi cations will be classified 
according to the WHO -Drug Enhanced plus Herbal Dict ionary.Classificat ion coding will be 
perform ed by  PAREXEL.
Serious adverse event reconciliation
SAE reconciliat ion reports are produced and reconciled wit h the Patient Safet y.

110(122)Appendix D Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver 
Biochemistry and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
1.Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately 
report Potential Hy’s Law ( PHL )cases andHy’s Law (HL)cases .It is not intended to be a 
comprehensive gui de to the m anagement of el evated liver biochemistries.
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry .The Investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets PHL 
criteria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL and HL events; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other vi sits including central  and all 
local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visit s; for exam ple, PHL 
criteria coul d be m et by  an elevated alanine aminotransferase ( ALT )from a central laboratory 
and/or elevated total bilirubin ( TBL )from a local laboratory .
The Investigator will also review adverse event (AE) data (for example, for AEs that may 
indicate elevat ions in liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL events.
The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL criteria to agree whether HLcriteria are met. HL 
criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanation for the el evations in liver biochemistry  
other than Drug -Induced Liver Injury  (DILI) caused by  the invest igational product ( IP).
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs )according to the outcome o f the review and 
assessment in line with standard safet y reporting processes.
2.Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST )or ALT ≥ 3× upper limit of normal ( ULN )together with
TBL ≥ 2×ULN at any  point during the study  following the start of study  medicat ion
irrespect ive of an increase in alkaline phosphatase ( ALP).
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3×ULN together with TBL ≥ 2×ULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IP, can be found to exp lain the co mbinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicat ing 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug.
For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specifi ed timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.

111(122)3.Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  patient who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
ALT ≥3×ULN
AST ≥3×ULN
TBL ≥2×ULN
When a pat ient meets any of the PHL identificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in co mbinat ion, the 
central  laboratory  will immediately  send an alert to the Invest igator (also sent to AstraZeneca 
representative).
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any  local  laboratory  reports where the PHL
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
Notify  the AstraZeneca representative
Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  the central  laboratory without delay
Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  electroni c Case Report Form ( CRF )
module(s) wi th the ori ginal  local laboratory  test resul t
When the identif ication criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section 2 within this Appendix 
for definit ion) by reviewing laboratory  reports from all previous vi sits (including both 
central  and l ocal laboratory  resul ts)
4.Follow -up
4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
Inform  the AstraZeneca representative that the patient has not met PHL criteria
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided 
in the Clinical Study  Protocol
4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investi gator will :
Notify  the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study Team.

112(122)Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the Invest igator will report the case as an SAE 
of Potenti al Hy’s Law; seri ous cri teria ‘Important medical event’ and causalit y 
assessment ‘y es/related’ according to Clinica l Study Protocol process for SAE reporting.
For patients that met PHL cri teria prior to starting IP, the investigator is not required to 
submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change in the patient’s condit ion.
Note: A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condit ion refers to a clinically  relevant 
change in any  of the individual liver biochemistry  param eters (ALT, AST or TBL) in 
isolation or in combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The 
determinat ion of whether there ha s been a significant change will be at the discret ion of 
the Invest igator, this may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any 
uncertaint y.
The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach f or the study  patients’ follow-up (including any  further l aboratory  testing) and the 
continuous review of data. Subsequent to this contact the Investigator will:
Moni tor the pati ent until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated . Com pletes fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the aetiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as discussed 
with the Study  Physician. This includes decid ing which tests available in the Hy’s Law 
lab kit should be used. 
Com plete the 3Liver eCRF Modules as informat ion beco mes available .
5.Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this Section should be fo llowed for all cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
As soon as possible after the bi ochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL cri teria other than DILI caused by  the IP , 
to ensure timely analysis and reporting to health authorities within 15 calendar days from date 
PHL cri teria was m et.The AstraZeneca Global Clinical Lead or equivalent and Glo bal Safet y

113(122)Physician will also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as 
appropriate.
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevat ions, 
a determination of whether the alternat ive explanatio n is an AE will be made and 
subsequent ly whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appro priate eCRF.
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE : update the previously submitted PHL SAE 
and AE eCRFs accordingly wit h the new informat ion (reassessing event term; causalit y 
and seriousness criteria) fo llowing the AZ standard processes .
If it is agreed that there is noexplanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IP:
Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard 
processes.
The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply .
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay of over 15 cal endar day sin obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess wh ether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that 
there is no alternat ive explanation unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
Provi des any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potential Hy’s Law, 
(report ter m now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to IP and 
seriousness cri teria is m edically important, according to Clinical Study Protocol process 
for SAE reporting.
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following Clinical Study  Protocol process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome 
of the review and amending the reported term if an alternative explanat ion for the liver 
biochemistry  elevat ions is determined.

Rationale and Objectives
AstraZeneca intends to collect and store deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) for geno micresearch 
to explore how genomic variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis of 
diseases, and the response to medicat ions.Geno micresearch may lead to better understanding 
of diseases, better diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in healt h care and to the 
discovery  of new diagnosti cs, treatm ents or m edicati ons.
In addit ion, collect ion of DNA samples from populat ions wit h well described clinical 
characterist ics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, 
possibly , to geneti cally guided treatment strategies.
Genomic Research Plan and Procedures
Selection of genomic research population
Study selection record
All patients will be asked to participate in this genomic research. Participation is vo luntary 
and if a patient declines to participate there will be no penalt y or loss of benefit. The patient 
will not be excluded from any aspect of the ma in study .
Inclusion criteria
For inclusio n in this geno micresearch, patients must fulfil all of the inclusio n criteria 
described in the main body  of the Clinical Study  Protocol  and:
 Provi de inform ed consent for the genomic sampling and analyses.
Exclusion criteria
Exclusio n from this geno micresearch may  be for any  of the excl usion criteria specified in the 
main study  or any  of the fo llowing:
 Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant
 Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusio n in 120 days of geno micsample 
collect ion
Discontinuation of patients from this genomic research
Specific reasons for discont inuing a patient fro m this geno micresearch are:
Withdrawal o f consent for geno micresearch: Patients m ay withdraw from  this geno mic
research at any  time, in dependent of any decisio n concerning participat ion in other aspects of 
the main study .Voluntary  discont inuat ion will not prejudice further treatment. Procedures for 
discontinuat ion are outlined in Sect ion 7.5of the main Clinical Study  Protocol .

116 (122 )Collection of samples for genomic research
A blood sam ple for genomic research will be obtain ed from the pati ents at Visit 3. Although 
DNA is stable, early sample co llection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through 
excluding pat ients who may wit hdraw due to an AE, such patients would be important to 
include in any geno micanalysis. If for any  reason the sam ple is not drawn at Visit 3, it may be 
taken at any  visit until the l ast study  visit. Only one sample should be collected per patient for 
geno mics during the study .Samples will  be collected, l abelled, stored and shipped as detailed 
in the Laboratory  Manual.
Coding and storage of DNA samples
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are 
important to maintain pat ient confident iality.Sampl es will  be stored for a m aximum  of 15 
years, fro m the date of last patient last visit, after which they will be destroyed. DNA is a 
finite resource that is used up during analyses. Samples will be stored and used until no further 
analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached.
An addit ional second code will be assigned to the blood either before or at the time of DNA 
extracti on repl acing the information on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will be 
ident ifiable by the second, unique number only. This number i s used to i dentify the sample 
and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca geno mics laboratori es, or at the designated 
organi sation.No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any  person 
(AstraZeneca emplo yee or designated organi sations working with the DNA).
The link between the patient enrolment/rando misatio n code and the second number will be 
maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca or 
designated organi sations.The link will be used to ident ify the relevant DNA samples for 
analysis, facilitate correlat ion of genoty pic resul ts wi th clinical  data, all ow regulatory  audi t 
and to trace samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal o f consent.
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements
The principles for ethical and regulatory  requi rements for the study , incl uding this geno mics 
research component, are outlined in Section 8of the m ain Clinical Study  Protocol .
Informed consent
The geno miccomponent of this study  is opti onal and the pati ent may  parti cipate in other 
components of the m ain study  without parti cipat ing in the geno miccomponent. To participate 
in the geno miccomponent of the study the patient must sign and date both the consent form 
for the m ain study  and the geno miccomponent of the study. Copi es of  both si gned and dated 
consent forms must be given to the patient and the original filed at the study  centre. The PI is 
responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the patient understands th at they  
may freely discont inue from the geno micaspect of the study  at any  time.

117(122)Patient data protection
AstraZeneca will not provide individual genoty pe resul ts to patients, any  insurance co mpany, 
any emplo yer, their family members, general physician unle ss requi red to do so by  law.
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genomic data being linked 
to the i dentity of the pati ent.In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might 
see both the genomic data and the pe rsonal  identifiers of a patient. For example, in the case of 
a medical emergency , an AstraZeneca Physician or an Invest igator might know a patient’s 
ident ity and also have access to his or her geno micdata. Also Regulatory Authori ties may  
requi re access to the relevant files, though the patient’s medical information and the geno mic
files woul d rem ain physically  separate.
Data management
Any genoty pe data generated in this study  will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca 
and/or designated organi sationsto analyse the samples.
The results from this geno micresearch may be reported in a separate report fro m the CSR or 
published in scient ific journals.
AstraZeneca and its designated organisat ions may share summary results (such as geno mic
differences fro m groups of individuals with a disease) fro m this geno micresearch wit h other 
researchers, such as Hospitals, Academic Organi sationor Heal th Insurance Co mpanies. This 
can be done by placing the results in scient ific databases, where they can be combined wit h 
the resul ts of similar studies to learn even more about healt h and disease. The researchers can 
only use this inform ation for healt h related research purposes. Researchers may see summary 
resul ts but they  will not be able to see individual patient data or any  personal  identifiers.
Some or all  of the clinical datasets from the main study  may be merged wi th the geno micdata 
in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.
Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size
The number of patients that will agree to participate in the geno micresearch is unknown. It is 
therefore not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal 
statist ical evaluat ion or whether only descript ive statist ics will be gene rated. A SAP will be 
prepared where appropriate.

Guidance Document
Labelling and shipment of biohazard samples
International Airline Transportation Associat ion (IATA) classifies bio hazardous agents into 
3categori es.For transport purposes the classificat ion of infectious substances according to 
risk groups was removed fro m the Dangerous Goods Regulations in the 46 th edition (2005).
Infectious substances are now classified either as Category  A, Category  B or Exem pt.There is 
no di rect rel ationship between risk groups and categori es A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, i s capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life-threatening or fatal  disease in 
otherwi se healt hy humans or animals. Category  A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus:
are to be pa cked and shipped in accordance wit h IATA Instruction 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusio n in Category  A.Category  B pathogens are eg, Hepatit is A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
HIV ty pes 1 an d 2.They  are assigned the following UN number and proper shipping name:
UN 3373 –Biological Substance, Category  B
are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650
Exempt -all other materials wit h minimal risk of containing pathogens
Clinical tria l samples will fall into Category  B or exempt under IATA regulations
Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient temperature in 
IATA 650 compliant packaging 
Biological samples transported in dry  ice requi re addi tional danger ous goods 
specification for the dry ice content
IATA co mpliant courier and packaging materials should be used for packing and 
transportation and packing should be done by an IATA certified person, as applicable
Samples routinely transported by  road or rail are pati ent to l ocal regul ations which 
requi re that they  are al so packed and transported in a safe and appropriate way  to contain 
any risk of infect ion or contaminat ion by using approved couriers and packaging / 
containment materials at all t imes. The IAT A 650 bio logical  sample containment 
standards are encouraged wherever possible when road or rail transport is used.

119(122)Appendix G Additional Safety Information
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the patientwas at immediate risk of death from the AEas it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the patient’s 
death .‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AEoccurred in a more severe form it 
might have caused death ( eg, hepatit is that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospitalisation
Outpatient treatm ent in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE , although the reasons 
for it may be ( eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema) .Hospital admissions and/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the patientwas enrolled in the study, prov ided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi talisat ion, disabili ty or incapaci ty but may jeopardize the patientor may  requi re 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious .These 
shoul d usual ly be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment 
with N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias ( eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convuls ions that do not result in hospitalisat ion

120(122)Time Course .Exposure to suspect drug .Has the patient actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the 
suspect drug?
Consistency wit h known drug profile .Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience .Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the 
dose of the suspect drug?
No al ternative cause .The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetio logy such 
as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Re-chall enge experi ence.Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally  recommend or support a re -
challenge.
Laboratory  tests .A specific laboratory invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the
relationship.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recogni sed feature of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal  relationship for the individual case.The expressi on 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment is per formed based on the available data including enough informatio n 
to make an informed judg ement .With limited or insufficient information in the case, it is likely 
that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack o f effect 
shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.

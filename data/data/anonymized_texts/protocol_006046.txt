Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Optional Substudy: Pharmacokinetic Sampling ( Visits 3 -10):  The following PK samples will be 
collected: pre -dose and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post -dose. 
Endpoints:  
Primary Endpoint:  The primary endpoint in this study is the change from baseline  (CFB)  to EOS 
in the ADHD -RS-5 total score.  
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  a) CGI-I, b) Conners 3  - Parent  composite T -score, and c) 
WFIRS -P average score  
Additional Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  a) Proportion of responders with 50% improvement 
in ADHD -RS-5 Total score , b) PSI-4-SF, c) ADHD -RS-5 Inattention and 
Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale scores, an d d) Conners 3  - Self composite T -score  (for ages 
8-11 years)  
Exploratory Endpoint s:   
  
 
Safety Assessments : Safety will be assessed using Adverse Events ( AEs), clinical laboratory 
tests, vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
(C-SSRS) . 
Sample Size : 
Seventy -two subjects per treatment group in the Intent-to-Treat ( ITT) population will yield 90% 
power at a significance level of 0.05 (two -sided) using a two -sample t -test with equal allocation 
to the treatment groups. This a ssum es an effect  size of 0. 547, observed in the comparison of 
SPN-812 200 mg and placebo in the SPN -812 Phase IIb study (based on the CFB to endpoint 
in the ADHD -RS-IV total score ). A total of 300 subjects ( 100 subjects in each of the three  
treatment groups) will be randomized to account for an anticipated 27.9% of randomized subjects 
not completing the study . 
Analysis Populations:  
 The Randomized population will include all enrolled subjects who had a baseline visit 
and are randomized via the IWRS.  
 The ITT population for efficacy will include all randomized subjects  who took at least one 
dose of study medication, and had a Baseline and at least one post -rando mization  
ADHD -RS-5 assessment.  Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment to which 
they were randomized.  
 The Per Protocol (PP) population consists of all subjects in the ITT population who 
completed all 10 visits with no missing ADHD -RS-5 assessments and no major protocol 
violations . Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment t hey actually received.  
 The Safety Population consists of all subjects randomized into the study who receive at 
least one dose of SM.  Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually 
received.  
 The PK population will include all subjects in  the safety population with ≥1 PK sample  
that is not below the Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLOQ) . 
Handling  of Missing Data:   
With respect to the primary analysis, missing ADHD -RS-5 Total scores will be assumed to be 
missing at random (MAR) and will be handled using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures 
(MMRM) method in SAS . The sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will be performed by 
assuming that missing ADHD -RS-5 Total Scores are missing not at random (MNAR). For 
analys is of secondary endpoints, missing values will be assumed as MAR .

viewing or disclosure of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  
Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Statistical  Methods:  
All tabulations of analysis results will include summaries for the following three treatments: SPN -
812 ER 400 mg, SPN -812 ER 200 mg, and placebo . 
Where appropriate, variables will be summarized descriptively (frequency count and percent for 
categorical variables, and number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation  (SD), median, 
minimum, and maximum  for continuous variables ).  
Categorical variables will be analyzed us ing categorical response methods such as Pearson’s 
Chi-square test. If expected frequencies are less than 5 in a given cell , then exact testing 
techniques will be used.  
Descriptive statistics  will be presented for demographics, data  from the clinical labor atory tests, 
vital signs, weight, ECGs, and C-SSRS .   
 
Efficacy Analyses  
Primary:  The primary efficacy variable, change from baseline in ADHD -RS-5 Total Score to 
Week 8  (EOS ), will be analyzed using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM), which 
assumes  that missing data are missing at random (MAR). The model will include fixed effect 
terms for baseline ADHD -RS-5 Total Score, age group, treatment, visit, and treatment -by-visit 
interaction as independent variables. The model parameters will be estimated u sing restricted 
maximum likelihood method with unstructured variance -covariance matrix and Kenward -Roger 
approximation to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. In case there is a convergence 
problem in the MMRM model with the unstructured variance covar iance matrix, the first 
(co)variance structure which does not have convergence problem will be used for the analysis 
from the following ordered list: 1) Toeplitz , 2) Autoregressive of order 1 , and 3) Compound 
symmetry . 
The adjusted mean (LS Mean) of CFB to  EOS for ADHD -RS-5 Total Score for each treatment 
group (Placebo, SPN -812 ER 200 mg and SPN -812 ER 400 mg) will be presented, along with 
the corresponding standard error. Each of the active treatment groups (SPN -812 ER 200 and 
400 mg) will be compared with placebo . The p -values, Least Squares (LS) of treatment means, 
differences between the LS treatment means and placebo, and 95% confidence intervals for 
the treatment differences will be computed.  
Sensitivity analysis: The sensitivi ty analysis assumes that missing ADHD -RS-5 Total Scores 
are missing not at random (MNAR). Placebo -based multiple imputation will be used to fill in 
missing values .  
Secondary: The secondary analyses will be based on the ITT population with missing values 
imputed using multiple imputation assuming MAR. All secondary analyses will be analyzed 
using ANCOVA (except CGI which uses ANOVA on the absolute value of CGI -I at Week 8 
(EOS) on the change from baseline at Week 8 (EOS) with treatment and baseline  as fixed 
effect.  
 
Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will be performed by treatment group based in the safety population. The 
incidence rate , severity, and relationship to SM for all  AEs will be summarized by treatment 
group for each System Organ Class and preferred term.

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any 
viewing or disclosure of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  
Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacogenomic  Methods:  
Sampling :  For PK analysis, a  maximum of five blood samples will be collected at one or more 
of Visits 3 -10. For PGx analysis, a single blood sample will be collected at screening.  
Bioanalytical  Analysis:  
Viloxazine concentrations and 5 -hydroxy -viloxazine glucuronide concentrations in plasma will 
be determined for all treatments using a validated achiral chromatographic method.  Viloxazine 
concentrations will be reported as viloxazine free base.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis:  
Plasma concentrations for viloxazine (and 5 -hydroxy -viloxazine glucuronide , if applicable)  will 
be provided . Population PK data will be pooled across all subjects who participate in this 
optional portion of the study and analyzed using nonlinear mixed -effects modeling methods. 
 
 
  Population PK analyses will be reported 
separately from the clinical study report.  
 
Pharmacogenomics Analysis  
A blood sample will be collected from each individual at screening for PGx analysis. If a given 
subject’s PK data warrant ev aluation of PGx, 
 This 
enzyme is involved in the metabolism of viloxazine and genetic variation may affect the 
pharmacokinetics o f the drug. The residual DNA will be stored for possible testing of genes 
involved in the efficacy and possible association with particular adverse events of the drug 
(e.g., understand the non -responders to treatment and/or individuals who show unusual saf ety 
profile). The DNA analysis will not be used for individual genetic characterization and the 
subject identity will be kept confidential.  If PGx testing is performed, individual data will be 
presented as a listing and summaries will be tabulated using d escriptive statistics .

1.1 Background  
Viloxazine hydrochloride (2-[(2-ethoxyphenoxy) methyl] morpholine hydrochloride) is a 
structurally distinct bicyclic norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) with antagonistic activity 
observed at 5 -HT7 and 5-HT1B receptors and agonistic activity at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C 
receptors .  Viloxazine was previously marketed in several European countries as an 
antidepressant .  Supernus is currently developing viloxazine (SPN -812) for potential use 
in the treatment of subjects with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), based on 
the compelling pharmacological properties and favorable safety profile of viloxazine, as 
well as on the current unmet medical need for effective long-acting non-stimulant ADHD 
treatment in children and adolescents. 
Compared to other bicyclic antidepressants, viloxazine has generally been found to be 
well tolerated, with no reports of major toxicity during short or long -term research studies.  
Anticholinergic-like effects and sedation have been less marked and less frequent than 
those of the tricyclic antidepressants, but nausea and vomiting have been common 
complaints with the immediate -release (IR) formulation and may be dose-related.  
Viloxazine is similar in structure to reboxetine and atomoxetine and is a racemic mixture 
of two stereoisomers of similar affini ties for many important neurotransmitter receptors.  It 
is an inhibitor of the reuptake of norepinephrine and affects norepinephrine-related 
functional activities, and although its inhibitory action on serotonin re -uptake appears to 
be weak, viloxazine may facilitate serotonin activity pre - or post -synaptically.  Furthermore, 
viloxazine is known to upregulate GABA B binding sites.  These neurotransmitters have 
been implicated in pathophysiology of ADHD, and drugs that are effective in the treatment 
of ADHD act in noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems. 
Viloxazine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral administration to man. 
Unchanged drug is the major component in blood at all times in man and is probably the 
pharmacologically active moiety.  Viloxazine is metabolized and rapidly excreted in the 
urine; there are no known active metabolites. 
1.2 Clinical Information  
Two Phase  2 studies in ADHD patients, one in adults  and one in children, and four 
Phase  1 studies in healthy adults  have been conducted with SPN -812 IR or  ER. An 
additional  open label extension study  in children is ongoing . 
Phase 1 Studies 
Phase  1 studies included comparison of SPN-812 ER formulation to an immediate-
release ( IR) formulation at single and multiple doses (812P103), evaluation of maximum 
tolerable doses  and cardiac safety in a single- and multiple- ascending dose study 
(812P120) , and assessment of the effect s of food and sprinkling on the relative 
bioavailability of viloxazine  (812P105) .  In addition, a [14C]-labelled oral IR solution was 
used to examine a bsorption, metabolism, and excretion  of viloxazine in healthy males 
(812P111 ).

Phase 2 Studies 
The proof-of -concept Phase 1/2 study (812P201 ), compared an IR formulation of SPN-812 
and placebo in a randomized, blinded study, administered three times daily in a dose 
range of 150 to 300 mg/d in 52 adults (26 per treatment) with ADHD .  In addition to 
assessing the safety and tolerability of SPN -812 IR, scores of both the investigator-rated 
and patient- rated Conner’s’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) were collected at weekly 
intervals during the 6 -week treatment period.   
 
  
The 812P202 study in children with ADHD assessed the effect of SPN-812 ER in reducing 
the symptoms of ADHD as measured by the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS -IV).  
Subjects aged 6 -12 years were randomized in a 1:2:2:2:2 ratio of placebo or active 
treatment (SPN -812 ER 100, 200, 300, or 400  mg) and received  three weeks of titration 
at 100 mg/week followed by five weeks of maintenance treatment for a total of eight weeks 
of therapy.     
 
           
 
   
 
 
 
 
Subjects who completed the 812P202 Phase  2 study were eligible to enroll in the open-
label, follow -on study (812P310), which is designed to collect long -term safety and efficacy 
data.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Information and data from clinical studies are available in detail in the SPN-812  ER 
Investigator’s Brochure, version 6.0. 
1.3 Study Rationale 
The results of the Phase 2 study, 812P202, indicate d that SPN-812 ER doses from 200 
to 400 mg/day were effective in the treatment of ADHD in 6-12 year-old children as 
assessed by change from Baseline in ADHD-RS -IV Total Score.  This study seeks to 
confirm the positive efficacy results for the 200  mg and 400 mg dose of SPN- 812 ER in a 
larger sample population of children 6-11 years old with ADHD, and to confirm the safety 
and tolerability of those doses in this age group. 
The ADHD-RS -5 is currently the rating scale most commonly used to measure efficacy of 
drug treatment of ADHD and is the primary efficacy  measure (Home Version: Child,  
Investigator Administered and Scored) for this study. 
In addition to assessing the effect of SPN-812 ER treatment on ADHD symptom reduction, 
the study aims to explore treatment response within other domains of the disorder, 
including functional impairment, and parental stress  (Becker et al., 2011 ; Wiener et al., 
2016 ).  ADHD is a chronic, debilitating disorder that  affects many aspects of daily l ife and 
has a substantial burden on family functioning.  Children with ADHD exhibit a number of 
functional impairments, and the motivation in seeking medical treatment typically stems 
from the need to address dysfunction in social, emotional, academic, and familial domains 
(Epstein and Weiss, 2012 ).  Therefore, optimal medical and behavioral management 
should ideally incorporate treatments that do not just improve symptoms of ADHD, but 
improve broader functioning of a patient, especially in the areas of self -esteem, 
educational achievement, and relationships with peers, teachers, and family.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY PLAN 
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm, parallel-group 
study , to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  SPN-812 ER as monotherapy for the 
treatment of children 6-11 years old with ADHD.  Approximately 300 subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 :1 ratio of placebo or one of the two active treatment arms 
(SPN -812 ER 200 or 400  mg).  Following up to four weeks of screening , subjects will be 
randomized and undergo three weeks of titration followed by five weeks of maintenance 
for a total of eight weeks of treatment and total study duration of up to 12 weeks .  The 
study schematic appears in Figure  1. 
Screening (Visit 1):   After administering the informed c onsent  form (ICF) and informed 
assent form (IAF, if applicable) , subjects will undergo initial screening evaluation 
including medical and psychiatric history, ECG, vital signs, physical exam ination , routine 
laboratory assessment , PGx sample collection, and urine drug screen .  ADHD diagnosis 
will be confirmed as will all s tudy inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Eligible subjects will be 
scheduled for a Baseline Visit within 28 days.  Subjects receiving ADHD medication at 
Screening will undergo a washout of at least one week before the Baseline Visit.  
Study Dose Treatment Phase (Visits 2-10): The Treatment Phase will consist of three 
weeks of Titration followed by five weeks of Maintenance until Visit 10/EOS.  
Baseline, Randomization, and Dispensation of Study Medication ( SM) (Visit 2): At the 
Baseline Visit, inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed to confirm continued eligibility 
(including urine pregnancy test for Females of Childbearing Potential [FOCP] only) .  
Eligible  subjects will be randomized and assigned the corresponding blinded dosing kit.  
The titration  card of the blinded SM will be dispensed and the first study dose taken . 
Study Dose Treatment: Titration (Visits 2- 4): Subjects will return to the clinical site for 
weekly visits to undergo efficacy and safety evaluations, pick up the next dosing card, 
and return the previous card. 
Study Dose Treatment: Maintenance (Visi ts 5-10): Subjects will return to the clinical site 
for weekly visits to undergo efficacy and safety evaluations , pick up the next dosing card 
(except at Visit 10 the last visit) , and return the previous card.  
End of Study (Visit 10): Subjects will return for final evaluation (subjects terminated prior 
to Visit 10 will also undergo EOS evaluations ).

Unscheduled visits may be conducted at the discretion of the investigator throughout the 
study. AE’s will be assessed at all unscheduled visits.  
An optional PK substudy will be conducted between visits 3 and 10, inclusive, to assess 
the PK characteristics of viloxazine (and its metabolite, 5-hydroxy-viloxazine glucuronide, 
if applicable) in this pediatric population.  A total of five blood samples will be taken: pre-
dose and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post dose. On the day the pre-dose sample is taken, SM 
must be administered at the site visit. Post-dose samples may be drawn on the same day 
or alternative visit days.  If drawn on alternate visit days, the time the SM was taken that 
day must be consistent with the dose time for the previous two days and the time of dose 
administration must be recorded for all three days. 
Subjects that have successfully completed this study will have the option of enrolling in a 
separate, open-label extension study.

should be documented in the source document and the most medically significant reason 
should be entered on the eCRF. 
If a subject misses doses of SM during this study, the Investigator shall counsel the 
subject/caregiver on the importance of compliance.  If the subject has consistently missed 
doses, he or she may be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator 
and in consultation with the Medical Monitor; all procedures for discontinuation will be 
followed.  
4 STUDY TREATMENT 
4.1 Study Medication Identity, Packaging and Labeling 
Test and reference (matching placebo) products are capsules packaged in a double -blind 
configuration and supplied in labeled blister cards by the Sponsor. 
Each SM blister card will include identical capsules containing placebo or 100 mg of SPN -
812 ER, and will supply a subject with seven days of dosing plus two extra days if needed.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Each card will be labeled with identification specific to the study and subject (subject 
number and initials). 
4.2 Study Medication Administration 
Each treatment will be administered as a single oral dose, once -a-day (QD), with or without 
food as either intact capsule, or as capsule content sprinkled on soft food. 
4.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Group 
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio at Visit  2 (Baseline) and will receive 
either placebo, SPN -812 ER 200 mg/day, or SPN-812 ER 400 mg/day. 
Allocation of study treatment will occur  centrally via an interactive web response system 
(IWRS) using  a randomization schedule to determine the kit assignment for each  subject 
being randomized.  Each SM kit contains eight dosing cards.  One dosing card will be 
given to the subject at each weekly visit.  
The initial dose may be taken at the clinic during the Baseline Visit, with the next dose 
taken the next morning.  Subjects will be titrated up at 100 mg/week to the final dose (1:1:1) 
as follows:  
Treatment A : Placebo  
Treatment B : SPN -812 ER 200 mg/day ( 2 100 mg SPN-812  ER) 
Treatment C : SPN-812 ER 400 mg/day (4  100 mg SPN-812  ER) 
 
Table 1  below presents the details of the dosing schedule for each treatment group. 
Table 1: Dosing Schedule 
 
4.4 Blinding  
The subject and all personnel involved with the conduct and the interpretation of the study, 
including the Investigators, study site personnel, the Sponsor and Contract Research 
Organization ( CRO ) clinical staff, including the Medical Monitor, will be blinded to the 
medication codes.  A limited number of Supernus personnel will perform and interpret the 
plasma assays for the population PK analysis and will be aware of these plasma data 
during the study.  These personnel will not have access to the randomization schedule, 
are not associated with the clinical conduct of the study, and will not reveal to any clinical 
personnel involved in the study the treatment to which a subject will be assigned.   
Randomization schedule data will be kept strictly confidential, filed securely by the IWRS 
vendor, and accessible only to authorized persons until the time of unblinding.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 4.5 Study Medication Handling  and Accountability 
All SM are supplied to the Investigator by the Sponsor. SM supplies must be kept in an 
appropriate sec ure area (e.g., locked cabinet) and stored according to the conditions 
specified on the SM label. 
Following Sponsor instructions and in compliance with International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH ) E6 as well as local, state, and federal regulations. T he Investigator 
and study staff will be responsible for the accountability of all clinical supplies (receiving, 
shipment, dispensing, inventory, and record keeping) in a SM accountability log, a copy 
of which will be collected by  Sponsor at the end of the st udy. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator allow the SM to be used other than as 
directed by this protocol.  Clinical supplies will not be dispensed to any individual who is 
not enrolled into the study. 
An accurate and timely record of the receipt of all clinical supplies; dispensing of SM to 
the subject; collection of unused supplies; and subsequent return of unused SM to the 
Sponsor must be maintained with dates.  This SM accountability log includes, bu t may not 
be limited to: (a) documentation of receipt of clinical supplies, (b) SM inventory log, (c)  SM 
accountability log, and (d)  all shipping service receipts.  Forms may be provided by the 
Sponsor.  Any comparable forms that the study site wishes to use must be approved by 
the Sponsor.  
The supplies and inventory records must be made available, upon request, for inspection 
by the designated representative of the Sponsor, or a representative of the FDA.  The 
assigned Clinical Research Associate (CRA ) will review these documents along with all 
other study conduct documents at specified intervals once SM has been received by the 
study site.  All used, partly used, and unused clinical supplies, including empty containers, 
are to be returned to the Sponsor at  the conclusion of the study, unless provision is made 
by the Sponsor for destruction of supplies and containers at the study site .  Upon 
completion of SM accountability and reconciliation procedures by study site personnel and 
documentation procedures by Sponsor personnel, SM is to be returned to the Sponsor 
with a copy of the completed SM disposition form. 
4.6 Concomitant Medica tions  
Subjects may not be on any prohibited medication as indicated in the Inclusion/Exclusion 
Criteria.   Specific concomitant medication prohibitions include known CYP1A2 substrates 
(e.g., theophylline, melatonin, olanzapine, duloxetine). No additional concomitant 
medications are allowed during the study, with the following exceptions:  
 Nutritional supplements (e.g. multivitamins,  fish oil) 
 EMLA® or other numbing cream for venipuncture  
 Common over- the-counter (OTC) therapies for minor transient ailments (e.g. 
acetaminophen for headache, ibuprofen for fever) 
All concomitant medications will be recorded in the eCRF.

5.1.5  Pharmacogenomic Sample Collection 
All subjects will have a blood sample taken at Screening for CYP2D6 pharmacogenomic 
testing. Results from individual tests will be used for research purposes only and will not 
be distributed.  
Samples will be identified only by the study subject number to maintain conf identiality. If 
a given subject’s PK data warrant evaluation of PGx,  
 
 This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of viloxazine and genetic variation 
may affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Samples will be stored for up to 10 years for 
potential future research purposes such as possible testing of genes involved in the 
efficacy and possible association with particular adverse eve nts of the drug (e.g., 
understand the non -responders to treatment and/or individuals who show unusual safety 
profile).  The DNA analysis will not be used for individual genetic characterization and the 
subject ’s identity will be kept confidential.  
Data from  samples will not have diagnostic value and will not be used for individual genetic 
characterization or development of a commercial product. At the end of testing or 10 years, 
any remaining samples will be destroyed. The subject may withdraw consent for 
pharmacogenomic testing at any time; if consent is withdrawn, the subject’s sample will 
be destroyed.  
5.1.6  Pharmacokinetic Sub-study -Sample Collection 
Participation in the PK Sub -study is optional.  All blood samples for PK analysis will be 
drawn at the clinical site.  A maximum of five blood samples (4 mL each) will be taken for 
PK analysis over the course of the study.  Blood may be drawn for quantitative PK analysis 
during Visits 3-10 . 
At one of these visits, subjects will arrive at the clinic in the morning prior to taking their 
morning dose.  A PK sample will be drawn pre-dose , after which the dose will be 
administered in the clinic.  Post-dose PK samples will be taken at approximately 1, 2, 4, 
and 6 hours after the administered dose.  Collection of the post-dose samples may be on

at approximately the same time and the times for that day and the previous two days were 
recorded . 
Blood samples will be collected and processed as per instructions in the Laboratory 
Manual.  The following excursion windows are permitted:  
 Pre-dose:  up to 30 minutes before dose 
 1-2 hours: ± 15 minutes 
 4 and 6 hours: ± 30 minutes 
 
6 STUDY VARIABLES 
6.1  Primary Efficacy Variable 
6.1.1  ADHD -RS-5 
The primary endpoint in this study is the CFB to EOS in the ADHD- RS-5 Total Score.  
The ADHD- RS-5 is an ADHD-specific rating scale designed and validated to assess 
current ADHD symptomatology as described in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and 
Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).  The scale consists of 18 items that 
directly correspond to the 18 DSM -5 symptoms and are further subdivided into two 
subscales: Hyperactivity/Impulsivity and Inattention (DuPaul, 2016 ).  The ADHD-RS -5 
scale rates the frequency and severity of each symptom on a 4-point Likert-type scale 
from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) and allows assessment of functional impairments linked to 
each symptom dimension.  The ADHD-RS -5 rating scale is one of the most commonly 
used measures of drug efficacy in the treatment of ADHD and is the primary outcome 
measure for this study.  The ADHD-RS -5 Home Version: Child instrument will be 
administered and scored by Investigator at each weekly visit from Baseline t hrough  EOS.  
6.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables 
The key secondary efficacy variables include: 
a) CGI-I 
b) Conners 3 – Parent, composite T -score 
c) WFIRS-P average score 
 
Additional secondary variables include: 
a) Proportion of responders with 50% improvement in the ADHD -RS-5 Total score 
(50% Responder rate) 
b) PSI-4-SF 
c) ADHD- RS-5 Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale scores 
d) Conners 3 – Self, composite T-score (for ages 8-11 years) 
 
6.2.1  Clinical Global Impression - Improvement 
The CGI scale was developed to provide a brief, stand- alone assessment of the clinician’s 
view of a subject’s global functioning prior to and after administration of a SM ( Guy 1976 ).  
The Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness (CGI -S) is a single item clinician ratin g 
of clinician’s assessment of the severity of the ADHD symptoms in relation to the clinician’s

Scale (CGI- I) is an assessment of how much the patient’s illness has imp roved or 
worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of treatment. Both CGI -S and CGI-
I are rated on a 7-point scale of 1 to 7 with 7 being “extremely ill” or “very much worse”, 
respectively.  Successful therapy is indicated by a lower overall s core in subsequent 
testing.  
 CGI-S will be evaluated by the Investigator at Screening and Baseline on a 7-point 
scale with 1=Normal,    2=Borderline ill, 3=Mildly ill, 4=Moderately ill, 5=Markedly 
ill, 6=Severely ill, and 7=Extremely ill.    
 CGI-I, relative to the condition at baseline, will be evaluated by the Investigator at 
each post-baseline visit on a 7 -point scale with 1=Very much improved, 2=Much 
improved, 3=Minimally improved, 4=No change, 5=Minimally worse, 6=Much 
worse, and 7=Very much worse.   
 
6.2.2  Conners 3 
The Conners 3rd Edition™ (Conners 3) is a focused diagnostic tool for assessment of 
ADHD and associated learning, behavior, and emotional problems in children ages 6 to 
18 years (Sparrow, 2010 ). The scale is based on the solid findings and key elements of 
its predecessor, the Conners' Rating Scales –Revised (CRS –R™), but offers a more 
refined assessment of ADHD and comorbid disorders  (e.g., oppositional defiant disorder 
and conduct disorder). The Conners 3 instrument includes items related to inattention, 
hyperactivity, and impulsivity, as well as assessments of executive functioning, learning 
problems, and relationships . Like previous versions, the Conners 3  combines teacher, 
parent, and student re ports to provide a particularly detailed and comprehensive 
evaluation of student behavior as observed in different settings. Teacher, parent, and self -
report (for 8-18y.o.)  rating scales are all available in long and short versions.  The short 
forms of Parent, Teacher, and Self Reports of Conners 3 are comprised (respectively) of 
45, 41, and 41 items.  All Conners 3 scale versions are scored on a 4-point scale (0-3), 
where a higher score indicates more severe symptom presentation. 
The Conners 3 scales will be administered at Visit 2 (Baseline) and at Week 8 (EOS) 
according to subjects’ age as follows : 
 Age 6-11:   Conners 3 – Parent:  Short (Conners 3-PS)  
 Age 8-11 only:  Conners 3 – Self-Report: Short (Conners 3-SRS)  
 
6.2.3  WFIRS-P 
The Weiss Functional Impairment Rating Scale (WFIRS) instrument evaluates ADHD-
related functional impairment  (Gajria, 2015 ; Thompson, 2017 ).  This scale allows the 
clinician to assess to what degree a patient’s behavior and emotional problems affect 
his/her ability to accomplish daily tasks and interactions  and helps to identify specific areas 
of difficulty.  The scale has been validated in the ADHD population; the parent -based 
version (WFIRS-P) completed by the parent/guardian of a child is used in this study and 
comprises 50 items grouped into six domains: Family, School (learning and behavior), Life 
Skills, Child’s Self -Concept, Social Activities, and Risky Activities.  The items relate to the 
past month and are scored using a 4- point Likert scale. Higher WFIRS-P scores indicate 
more severe functional impairment.   
This instrument will be completed at Baseline and EOS by the parent/caregiver.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 6.2.4  PSI-4- SF 
The Parenting Stress Index, Fourth Edition (PSI-4) questionnaire evaluates the magnitude 
of stress in the parent-child relationship based on the parent’s perception of the child’s 
characteristics, the personal characteristics of the parent, and the interaction between the 
parent and the child (Abidin, 19 95).  The short form (PSI-4-SF) of the PSI -4 consists of 36 
items divided into three domains: parental distress , parent-child dysfunctional interaction, 
and difficult child.  The PSI -4-SF scale was developed for parents of children ages 1 month 
to 12 years.   
This scale will be completed at Baseline and at EOS by the parent/caregiver. 
6.3 Safety Variables  
The safety variables for the study are AEs, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, ECG 
results, and treatment -emergent suicidal ideation. 
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who have entered this 
study and for alerting Supernus or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if 
this event may be considered an unanticipated benefit to the subjects. 
Safety assessments include monitoring, evaluation, and recording of all concomitant 
medications, and the evaluation of AEs, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs and 12-
lead ECGs, C- SSRS , and the performance of physical examinations as detailed in the 
Schedule of Events and Assessments. 
6.4 Adverse Events 
As defined by the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practices ( GCP ), an adverse event (AE) 
is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with treatment. 
An AE can be: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
• Any new disease, intercurrent injuries, or exacerbation of an existing disease. 
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG) that results in 
symptoms, a change in treatment, or discontinuation from SM. 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline.  
Surgical procedures are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that require 
surgery.  The condition for whic h the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is detected 
during the study period. 
6.4.1  Causality  
Adverse events may be categorized as either Adverse Drug Reactions or Suspected 
Adverse Drug Reactions based on their relationship to SM and the degree of certainty 
about causality. 
Suspected adverse drug reactions (SADRs) are a subset of adverse events for which 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE, i.e., there 
is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any 
viewing or disclosure of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  
Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a subset of all SADRs for which there is reason to 
conclude that the drug caused the event. 
6.4.2  Recording and Evaluation of Adverse Events 
All subjects who are screened (Visit 1) will be questioned regarding the occurrence of AEs.  
At each contact with the subject, the investigator must seek information on AEs by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all AEs should be 
recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the a ppropriate adverse event 
module of the eCRF.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic 
procedures results should be recorded in the source document, though they may be 
grouped under one diagnosis.  For example, fever, elevated WBC, cough, abnormal chest 
X-ray, etc., can all be reported as “pneumonia”.  
All AEs occurring after screening and throughout the study period must be recorded.  A 
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE ) is defined as an AE with a start date on or 
after the first dose of study drug is taken, or that worsened following first administration of 
study drug.  All AEs in this study will be recorded after administration of SM, therefore all 
will be treatment-emergent.   The clinical course of each AE should be followed unti l 
resolution or until, in the medical judgment of the Investigator, the event has stabilized or 
is assessed as chronic.  
The Investigator is responsible for evaluating AEs and determining the following: 
• Serious vs. Non -serious: Is the event a Serious Averse Event (S AE)? 
• Causality: Was AE related or possibly related to the SM?  
• Severity: How pronounced is the incapacity/discomfort caused by an AE ? 
6.4.3  Criteria for Assessing Severity 
The Investigator will evaluate the comments of the subject and the response to treatment 
in order that he or she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE.  Severity refers 
to the accumulated intensity of discomfort/impairment of health since the last recording of 
AEs and will be assessed according to the following criteria: 
• Mild: Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated 
• Moderate: Discomfort enough to interfere with usual activity and may warrant 
intervention  
• Severe:    Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly 
affects clinical status and warrants intervention 
The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness. 
6.4.4  Criteria for Assessing Causality 
The Investigator is responsible for determining the relationship between the administration 
of SM and the occurrence of an AE as not suspected or as a suspected reaction to SM.  
These are defined as follows: 
Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the AE to SM administration makes a causal 
relationship unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or  underlying conditions 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
• Not related:  Temporal relationship to SM administration is missing or 
implausible, or there is an evident other cause.

This document is confidential.  It contains proprietary information of Supernus® Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Any 
viewing or disclosure of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  
Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. • Unlikely related:  Temporal relationship to SM administ ration makes a causal 
relationship improbable; and other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.  
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the AE to SM administration makes a causal  
relationship possible , and other drugs, ther apeutic interventions, or underlying 
conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
• Possibly related:   Temporal relationship to SM administration is plausible, but 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals could also explain event.  
Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  This will be reported 
as a Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR) . 
• Definitely related : Temporal relationship to SM administration is plausible, and 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals cannot explain event.  The 
response to withdrawal of the medication (dechallenge) should be clinically 
plausible.  The event must be definitive pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
This will be reported as an Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) . 
6.4.5  Serious Adverse Events 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  An AE or ADR is considered 
“serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in one of the following 
outcomes:  
• death  
• life-threatening AE (i.e., the subject was at immediat e risk of death from the AE 
as it occurred.  This does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death.) 
• in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization, but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They may 
jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, blood dyscrasias, a 
seizure that did not result in in-patient hospitalization or intensive treatment for allergic 
bronchospasm in an emergency department would typically be considered serious . 
6.4.6  Investigator Responsibilities for Reporting SAEs 
The Investigator must immediately report to the Sponsor all SAEs, regardless of whether 
the Investigator believes they are drug related. 
All SAEs must be reported to the Drug Safety Contact within 24 hours of first becoming 
aware of the SAE.  The Investigator must complete an SAE Form and include a detailed 
description of the SAE, as well as other available information pertinent to the case (e.g., 
hospital records, autopsy reports and other relevant documents).  The investigator will 
keep a copy of this SAE Report form on file at the study site.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. The Investigator or study physician, after thorough consideration of all facts that are 
available, must include an assessment of causality of an AE to SM in the report to the 
Sponsor.  
Follow -up information, or new information available after the initial report, should be 
actively sought and reported to the Sponsor , as it becomes available, using the SAE 
Report Form.   
 
 
 
  
6.4.7  Other Events Requiring Immediate Reporting 
The Investigator must report a pregnancy that occurs in a subject during a clinical study 
to the Drug Safety Contact within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the event.  
Pregnancy should be reported on a Pregnancy Report Form.  The Investigator should 
discuss the case with the Medical Monitor; the Investigator must follow any pregnant 
subject for 3 months after the child is born.  Any AEs concerning the pregnancy of the 
subject during pregnancy or the child after birth must be documented and reported to the 
Sponsor . 
Acute suicidal crisis or clinically significant suicidal behavior or ideation should be reported 
to the Drug Safety Contact within 24 hours of fi rst becoming aware of the event.  
6.4.8  Sponsor Responsibilities for Reporting SAEs  
The Sponsor will inform Investigators and regulatory authorities of reportable events, in 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, on an expedited basis (i.e., within 
specific timeframes).  For this reason, it is imperative that study sites submit SAE 
information to the Sponsor in the manner described above. 
Investigators must comply with the applicable regulatory requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs to the Institutional Review Board ( IRB).  Investigators must also submit 
the safety information provided by the Sponsor to the IRB unless the country legal 
regulation requires that the Sponsor should be responsible for the safety reporting to the 
IRB. 
It is the resp onsibility of the Sponsor to notify all participating investigators, in a written 
IND safety report, of any SADR that is both serious and unexpected.  The Sponsor will 
also notify participating investigators of any findings from other sources (other studies, 
animal and in vitro testing, etc.) that suggest a significant risk for human subjects.  Such 
findings will typically lead to safety -related changes in the study protocol, Informed 
Consent, and/or Investigator’s Brochure.  
6.5 Treatment-Emergent Suicidal Idea tion 
Prospective assessment of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior is a mandatory part of 
the safety evaluations for any drug developed for a psychiatric indication (FDA Guidance 
for Industry: Prospective Assessment of Occurrence in Clinical Trials : Suicidal Ideation 
and Behavior, 2012).  In this study, the initial evaluation of subjects will be conducted prior 
to enrollment to assess lifetime suicidal ideation and to identify subjects who must not 
participate in the trial due to pre -existing suicidality risk.  The assessment will then be 
repeated at each subsequent study visit to monitor the occurrence of new suicidal and 
self-injurious tendencies.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 6.5.1  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS)  
Assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior will be conducted using the Columbia-
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS).  The C-SSRS is an FDA-recommended 
prospective assessment instrument that directly classifies suicidal ideation and behavior 
events into 11 preferred categories, including 5 levels of suicidal ideation, 5 levels of 
suicidal behavior, and the category of self-injurious behaviors with no suicidal intent.   
The instrument has been validated and used successfully in both children and adolescent 
patients with various psychiatric disorders that do not  involve cognitive impairment.  The 
C-SSRS outcomes that can be used for clinical management and safety monitoring are 
suicidal lethality rating, suicidal ideation score, and suicidal ideation intensity rating. 
6.5.2  Suicide Risk Management Plan 
The protocol procedures related to clinical care of patients with treatment-emergent 
suicidal ideation and behavior must be implemented to ensure proper management of the 
event and protection of subject’s safety.  If a disclosure of suicidal ideation is revealed as 
part o f the C-SSRS questionnaire or when a subject spontaneously expresses that he/she 
may be a threat to him/herself, the study team should be prepared to quickly evaluate the 
event and to determine the appropriate course of action. 
6.5.2.1  Assessment of Suicide Risk 
Any indication of suicidal ideation should be evaluated as soon as possible by 
appropriately trained staff. The Investigator is responsible for making the final judgment 
regarding potential suicide risk and need subsequent action.  
6.5.2.2  Acute Suicidal Crisis 
A person evaluated as being at high risk should be transferred to an immediate care 
facility. The Investigator will guide intervention as clinically indicated and follow up with 
the subject within one week and/or refer him/her to a qualified mental health pr ofessional.  
6.5.2.3  Non-acute Suicidal Risk 
The Investigator will conduct safety planning with the subject and will follow up within one 
week.  
 
Reference materials for subjects and caregivers should include lists of mental health 
organizations and professionals, o utpatient behavioral services, local crisis and peer 
support groups and Suicide/Crisis Hotlines. 
6.6  Clinical Measurements 
6.6.1  Laboratory   
All clinical laboratory tests will be performed by a central laboratory as specified in the 
reference binder.  
Details for collecting, handling, and shipping samples (including shipment addresses) will 
be detailed in a separate clinical laboratory manual.  The Schedule of Events  and 
Assessments ( Table  2) shows the time points at which blood and urine samples will be 
collected for clinical laboratory tests (and plasma concentration levels for those subjects 
that choose to participate in the P K substudy) . 
Table 3  presents the clinical laboratory tests to be performed .

7 STATISTICAL METHODS 
7.1 General Considerations 
All statistical analysis will be performed using SAS version 9.2 or higher by , which is 
the designated CRO.  will be responsible for developing a unique program for each 
TLF to create a TLF report and deliver to Supernus at the completion of the study.   
All tabulations of analysis results will include summaries for the following three treatments: 
SPN-812 E R 400 mg, SPN-812 ER 200 mg, and placebo. 
Where appropriate, variables will be summarized descriptively (frequency count and 
percent for categorical variables, and number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation 
(SD), median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables ). 
The data summaries will be accompanied by individual subject data listings, as specified 
in Sections 16.2 and 16.4 of ICH Guidance E3, sorted by unique subject identifier.  All 
data available from the electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be listed.  Unscheduled 
measurements will be excluded from the descriptive statistics and statistical analysis but 
will be included in listings.  
Categorical variables will be analyzed using categorical response methods such as 
Pearson’s Chi -square test.  If expected frequencies are less than 5 in a given cell , then  
exact testing techniques will be used. 
Complete details of the statistical analysis will be provided in a separate statistical analysis 
plan (SAP).  The statistical analysis methods described in the SAP will supersede the 
statistical methods described in this protocol. 
7.2 Handling of Missing Data  
With respect to the primary analysis, missing ADHD-RS -5 Total Scores will be assumed 
to be missing at random (MAR), that is, given the observ ed data, the reason for the missing 
data does not depend on the unseen data.  The Mixed Model for Repeated Measures 
(MMRM)  method, implemented via SAS® PROC MIXED (SAS/STAT Software), will be 
used for handling missing ADHD -RS-5 Total Scores under MAR assum ption . Under MAR, 
the propensity for a data point to be missing is not related to the missing data, but is related 
to some of the observed data.  
The sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will be performed by assuming that 
missing ADHD- RS-5 Total Scores are missing not at random (MNAR) meaning that the 
probability that an observation is missing may depend on its underlying unobserved value.  
For analysis of secondary endpoints, missing values will be assumed as MAR. 
For safety analyses, missing dates for AEs and non -study medication use will be imputed 
as described in the SAP. Missing data for all other safety endpoints will not be imputed.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. Duration of treatment exposure will be summarized by duration category and will also be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). 
Percent of study drug compliance is defined as {(number of capsules dispensed minus 
number of capsules returned) / 4 × (date  of last dose minus date of first dose + 1)}* 100%.  
For each treatment, SM compliance will be summarized by compliance category (<80%, 
80-120%, and >120%) and number of subjects in each compliance category.  Study 
medication compliance will also be summarized as a continuous variable using descriptive 
statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for each 
treatment. 
Summaries of treatment compliance and exposure will be presented separately for the 
Titration Period, Maintenance Period, and combined Titration and Maintenance Periods. 
7.7 Concomitant Medica tions 
Concomitant medications will be assigned an 11-digit code using the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO DD) drug codes.  Concomitant medications will be 
further coded to the appropriate Anatomical -Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) code indicating 
therapeutic classification.  A tabular summary of concomitant medications by drug class 
will be presented for the safety population . 
7.8 Efficacy Analysis  
7.8.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis 
7.8.1.1  Primary analysis 
The primary efficacy variable, change from baseline in ADHD-RS -5 Total Score to Week 
8 (EOS),  will be analyzed using MMRM, which assumes that missing data are MAR. The 
model will include fixed effect terms for baseline ADHD -RS-5 Total Score, age group , 
treatment, visit, and treatment-by -visit interaction as independent variables . The model 
parameters will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood method with 
unstructured variance -covariance matrix and Kenward-Roger approximation to estimate 
denominator degrees of freedom. In case there is a convergence problem in the MMRM 
model with the unstructured variance-covariance matrix, the first (co)variance structure 
which does not have convergence problem will be used for the analysis from the following 
ordered list: 1) Toeplitz , 2) Autoregressive of order 1 , and  3) Compound symmetry.  
 
The adjusted mean (LS Mean) of CFB to EOS for ADHD-RS -5 Total Score for each 
treatment group (Placebo, SPN-812 ER 200 mg and SPN-812 ER 400 mg) will be 
presented, along with the corresponding standard error. Each of the treatment groups 
(SPN -812 ER 200 mg and 400 mg) will be compared with the Placebo. The p-values, 
Least Squares (LS) of treatment means, differences between the LS treatment means and 
placebo, and 95% confidence intervals for the treatment differences will be computed. 
To maintain the Type I error rate at 5% level, a sequential testing ( Westfall et al ,1999 ) of 
the null hypotheses  H01: No treatment mean difference between SPN-812 ER 400 mg 
group and placebo group and H 02: No treatment mean difference between SPN-812 ER 
200 mg group and placebo group will be performed. If H 01 is not rejected, then H 02 will not 
be tested and the conclusion will be that neither dose groups are efficacious. If H 01 is 
rejected, then H 02 will be tested. If H 02 is rejected then it will be concluded that both SPN-
812 ER 400 mg and SPN-812 ER 200 mg are superior to placebo. If H 01 is rejected and

viewing or disclosure of such information that is not authorized in writing by the Sponsor is strictly prohibited.  
Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. H02 is not rejected then it will be concluded that only SPN-812 ER 400 mg is superior to 
placebo.  
7.8.1.2  Sensitivity Analyses 
The sensitivity analysis assumes that missing ADHD- RS-5 Total Scores are MNAR. 
Placebo -based multiple imputation will be used to fill in missing values. This approach 
may be considered “worst -case” sensitivity analyses as it assumes that after 
discontinuation, subjects from the ac tive treatment arms would adopt the outcome model 
estimated from the placebo arm. The placebo-based imputation will be implemented as 
described in the SAP.  
7.8.2  Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The secondary analyses will be based on the ITT po pulation with missing values imputed 
using multiple imputation assuming MAR. 
 
All secondary analyses will be analyzed using ANCOVA (except CGI which uses ANOVA 
on the absolute value of CGI-I at Week 8 (EOS) on the change from baseline at Week 8 
(EOS) with treatment and baseline as fixed effect. Each of the treatment groups (SPN-
812 ER 200 mg and 400 mg) will be compared with the Placebo. The p-values, Least 
Squares means of the treatment groups, differences between the LS treatment means 
and placebo (SPN-812 ER 200 mg minus Placebo and SPN-812 ER 400 mg minus 
Placebo), and 95% confidence intervals for the treatment differences will be computed.  
7.8.2.1  Key secondary analyses 
The analyses of key secondary objectives will be conducted on the following sequentially 
ordered endpoints  for tes ting: 1) CGI-I, 2) Conners 3 – Parent composite T-score, and 
3) WFIRS-P. 
To preserve the overall type I error rate at 0.05 for the key secondary endpoints, a 
sequential testing procedure will be used with the following features.  
First, only dose or doses that are significantly different from placebo for the primary 
endpoint will be tested for secondary endpoints. If the primary endpoint analysis does not 
show a rejection of H 01 (i.e.,  the 400 mg is not superior to placebo) then no multiplicity 
adjustment will be performed for any of the key secondary endpoints.  If the primary 
endpoint analysis indicates that only 400 mg dose is superior to placebo (only  H01 is 
rejected), no multiplicity adjustment is required. Otherwise, multiplicity adjustment will be 
performed as in the following. 
The first of the secondary endpoints (CGI-I) will be used to test each treatment group to 
placebo using a sequential testing of the null hypotheses H 01: No treatment mean 
difference between SPN -812 ER 400 mg group and placebo group and H 02: No treatment 
mean difference between SPN-812 ER 200 mg group and placebo group will be 
performed. If H 01 is not rejected, then H 02 will not be tested and the conclusion will be that 
neither dose groups are efficacious. If H 01 is rejected, then H 02 will be tested. If H 02 is 
rejected, then it will be concluded that both SPN -812 ER 400 mg and SPN-812 ER 200 mg 
are superior to Placebo. If H 02 is not rejected, then it will be co ncluded that only SPN -812 
ER 400 mg is superior to placebo. Then, the second secondary endpoint (Conners 3) will 
be tested in the same manner but only using those doses that were retained from the 
primary and the first secondary endpoint. Finally, the third key secondary endpoint 
(WFIRS-P) will be tested in the same manner but only using those doses that were

endpoints.  
a) CGI-I – The absolute value of CGI-I at EOS will be analyzed using ANCOVA with 
fixed effects for treatment and baseline as a covariate. To compare the treatment 
groups, the difference in LS means (SPN -812 ER 200 mg minus Placebo and 
SPN-812 ER 400 mg minus Placebo) will be presented along with the 95% 
confidence interval (CI) around the difference and p -value. 
b) Conners 3 - Parent - A composite T-score will be calculated by averaging over the 
six domains, and the change from baseline to Week 8 (EOS) in the composite T-
score will be analyzed using ANCOVA model with fixed effects for treatment and 
baseline as a covariate. Each of the treatment groups (SPN -812 ER 200 mg and 
400 mg) will be compared with the Placebo. The p-values, Least Squares means, 
differences between the LS treatment means and placebo, and 95% confidence 
intervals for the treatment differences will be computed.  
c) WFIRS-P - The change from baseline in WFIRS-P to Week 8 (EOS) will be 
analyzed using ANCOVA model with fixed effects for treatment and baseline as a 
covariate. Missing Subscale scores and Total Score will be handled using multiple 
imputation under MAR assumption for inferential analyses. Each of the treatment 
groups (SPN -812 ER 200 mg and 400 mg) will be compared with the Placebo. The 
p-values, LS means of treatment groups, differences between the LS means and 
placebo, and 95% confidence intervals for the treatment differences will be 
computed. 
 
7.8.2.2  Additional secondary analyses  
Additional secondary analyses of the secondary efficacy variables will include:  
a) 50% Responder rate for ADHD-RS -5 - Percent reduction will be calculated as: % 
reduction =  100*(ADHD-RS-5 Total Score at Week 8 (EOS) - Baseline ADHD -RS-5 
Total Score)/ Baseline ADHD -RS-5 Total Score. The proportion of responders will be 
presented for each treatment group. The 2 -sided 95% CI around the difference in 
proportions (SPN -812 ER 200 mg minus Placebo, SPN- 812 ER 400 mg minus 
Placebo) and the p -value from Pearson’s Chi -squared Test or Fisher’s Exact Test  will 
be presen ted. 
b) PSI-4-SF  - The change from baseline in PSI-4 total score to Week 8 (EOS) will be 
analyzed using ANCOVA model with fixed effects for treatment and baseline as a 
covariate. Each of the treatment groups (SPN-812 ER 200 mg and 400 mg) will be 
compared with the Placebo. The p-values, LS means of treatment groups, differences 
between the LS means and placebo will be presented.  
c) ADHD-RS -5 Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscales - The primary analysis 
for ADHD-RS -5 Total score will be repeated for the change from baseline to EOS in 
ADHD-RS -5 Inattention and the change from baseline to Week 8 (EOS) in 
Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscales.  
d) Conners 3  - Self – The analysis for Conners 3  - Parent will be repeated for Self scores.  
The key secondary analyses will be repeated for the per protocol population for 
supplementary analyses.

The primary and key secondary efficacy variable analyses may be repeated by the 
following subgroups to explore the heterogeneity of treatment effect:  
a) Gender  (male, female) 
b) Age (6-9 years, 10 -11 years) 
c) Race (white, non-white)

Exploratory analyses of the key exploratory efficacy variables will include: 
  
 
  
 
  
  
 
7.9 Sample Size and Power Considerations 
Seventy -two subjects per treatment group in the ITT population will yield 90% power at a 
significance level of 0.05 (two-sided) using a two-sample t-test with equal allocation to the 
treatment groups.  This assumes an effect size of 0. 547, observed in the comparison of 
SPN-812 200  mg and placebo in the SPN-812 Phase IIb study (based on the CFB to 
endpoint in the ADHD -RS-IV total score).  A total of 300 subjects ( 100 subjects in each of 
the three  treatment groups) will be randomized to account for an anticipated 27.9% of 
randomized subjects not completing the study. 
7.10 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis will be performed 
7.11 Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
Plasma concentrations for viloxazine ( and 5 -hydroxy-viloxazine glucuronide , if applicable)  
will be provided. 
 
    Population PK data analysis will be performed using 
nonlinear mixed -effects modeling program (NONMEM ).  The structural model for 
viloxazine (and 5-hydroxy-viloxazine glucuronide, if applicable) may include data from 
studies in which sampling was more intensive than in the present study.  Inclusion of 
covariates in the pharmacokinetic model will be accomplished through a systematic 
process.  For each NONMEM run, covariate graphics will be  examined for relationships 
between covariates and the post hoc etas.  Covariates of interest will include  (but not be 
limited to) age, gender, body size, etc. Population PK analyses will be reported separately 
from the clinical study report. 
7.12 Pharmacogenomic Analysis 
If PGx testing is performed, individual data will be presented as a  listing and summaries 
will be tabulated using descriptive statistics.

Such information may be used solely for the purpose of reviewing or performing this study. 7.13 Safety Analysis 
Safety analysis as described below will be conducted on the Safety Population. Safety 
data that will be evaluated include concomitant medications, AEs, clinical laboratory 
results, vital signs, ECGs, and findings from the physical examinations.  Su icidal ideation 
and suicidal behavior will be measured by C-SSRS . 
The incidence rate of AEs will be calculated by treatment group for each System Organ 
Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT).  The severity of the AEs and the relationship to 
SM will be summarized by treatment group for each SOC and PT. 
AEs will be summarized using discrete summaries at the subject and event level by 
System Organ Class and Preferred Term, and by severity and relationship separately for 
each treatment group.  Verbatim description and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA ) SOCs and PTs for all AEs will be contained in the subject data 
listings.  
Clinical laboratory values will be summarized by visit by treatment group using descriptive 
statistics for hematology and biochemistry.  For quantitative laboratory parameters, both 
actual values and change from Screening  values will be summarized. 
Vital signs will be summarized by visit by treatment group using descriptive statistics.  Both 
actual values and change from baseline  will be summarized. 
ECG results will be summarized by visit by treatment group using descriptive statistics (for 
quantitative ECG parameters) and frequency tables (for qualitative ECG parameters, 
including the overall ECG finding).  
C-SSRS outcomes will be summarized using number and percent of subjects by 
categories for suicidal ideation only, suicidal behavior only and suicidality (ideation and 
behavior combined). The summary will be presented by treatment groups .

Quality Assurance team or qualified designee, which is an independent function from the 
study conduct team. 
8.3.1  Data Collection 
The primary source document will be the subject’s medical record.  If separate research 
records are maintained by the Investigator(s), both the medical record and the research 
record will be considered the source documents for the purposes of monitoring and 
auditing the study.  
Electronic data collection techniques will be used to collect data directly from the study 
sites using eCRFs.  The electronic data will be stored centrally in a fully validated clinical 
database.  
Data recorded on source documents will be transcribed into the eCRFs in accordance with 
the eCRF Completion Instructions that are provided to the study site s.  The Investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that all sections of each eCRF are completed correctly, and that 
entries can be verified against source documents.  The eCRFs will be monitored for

 Other minor editorial and administrative changes to improve clarity and correct errors 
 
RATIONALE  
1. The 812P303 Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was revised and updated based on the FDA review 
comments (FDA Advice Letter dated 19 July 2018, Ref ID 4294123).   The protocol was amended to 
reflect the changes in the revised SAP, including the following updates: 
 The secondary objectives and endpoints were updated and clarified to identify those considered 
“key” for data analysis and interpretation purposes . The exploratory objectives and endpoints 
were updated accordingly. 
 Methods for handling missing data and for conducting the sensitivity analyses were revised (e.g. , 
the LOCF method will no longer be used).  
 Clarifications were made to the definitions of the analysis populations and to the subject 
disposition categories. 
 The section on the primary endpoint analysis was updated to include a fixed effect of age group 
and to provide new details with respect to the analysis of covariance (per FDA suggestion ).  
 The Secondary Efficacy Analyses Sections were expanded to include descriptions of the key 
secondary analyses , additional secondary analyses, and subgroup analyses .  The Exploratory 
Analyses section was also added for the newly identified exploratory efficacy variables.

Secondary: The CFB to EOS for continuous 
key secondary and additional endpoints 
will be analyzed using ANCOVA or ANOVA maximum likelihood (REML) approach. An 
unstructured (co)variance structure will be 
used to model the within subject errors. 
The primary efficacy variable, change from 
baseline in ADHD -RS-5 Total Scor e to

Mixed Model for Repeated Measures 
(MMRM), which assumes that missing 
data are missing at random (MAR). The 
model will include fixed effect terms for 
baseline ADHD -RS-5 Total Score, age 
group, treatment, visit, an d treatment -by-

The model parameters will be estimated 
using restricted maximum likelihood 
method with unstructured variance -
covariance matrix and Kenward -Roger 
approximation to estimate denominator 
degrees of fre edom. In case there is a 
convergence problem in the MMRM 
model with the unstructured variance 
covariance matrix, the first (co)variance 
structure which does not have 
convergence problem will be used for the 
analysis from the following ordered list: 1) 
Toep litz, 2) Autoregressive of order 1,  and 
3) Compound symmetry.  
The adjusted mean (LS Mean) of CFB to 
EOS for ADHD -RS-5 Total Score for each 
treatment group (Placebo, SPN -812 ER 200

values, Least Squares (LS) of treatment 
means, differences between the LS 
treatment means and placebo, and 95% 
confidence intervals for the t reatment 
differences will be computed.  
Sensitivity analysis: The sensitivity analysis 
assumes that missing ADHD -RS-5 Total

47 7.2 Handling of Missin g Data, p.34  
For primary efficacy analysis, missing data 
will be assumed as Missing at Random 
(MAR) and will be handled using Mixed 
Models Repeated Measures (MMRM) 
technique according to the MMRM 
paradigm. Under MAR, the propensity for 
a data point to be m issing is not related to 
the missing data, but is related to some of 
the observed data. For secondary and first 
sensitivity analyses, the last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) method of 
imputation will be used. The underlying 
assumption for using the LOC F method is 
based on the fact that 35% of subjects 
early terminated (ET) before completion 
of the Phase II 202 study as lost -to-follow -
up. It is assumed that majority of subject 
dropout in the Phase III trial will follow the 
same pattern and hence, the ass umption 
of Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) 
can be applied and the LOCF imputation 
for missing data can be used.  7.2 Handling of Missing Data , p.36  
For With respect to the  primary efficacy  
analysis, missing data  ADHD -RS-5 Total 
Scores will be assumed as to be  Mmissing 
at Rrandom (MAR ), that is, given the 
observed data, the reason for the missing 
data does not depend on the unseen data. 
and will be handled using  The Mixed 
Model s for Repeated Measures (MMRM) 
technique according to the MMRM 
paradigm  method,  implemented via SAS® 
PROC MIXED (SAS/STAT Software), will be 
used for handling missing ADHD -RS-5 Total 
Scores under MAR assumption . Under 
MAR, the propensity for a data point to be 
missing is not related to the missing data, 
but is related to some of the observed 
data. For secondary and first sensitivity 
analyses, the last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) method of imputation will 
be used. The underlying assumption for 
using the LOCF method is based on the fact 
that 35% of subjects early terminated (ET) 
before completion of the Phase II 202 study 
as lost tofollow up. It is assumed that 
majority of subject dropout in the Phase III 
trial will follow the same pattern and 
hence, the assumption of Missing 
Completely at Random (MCAR) can be 
applied and the LOC F imputation for 
missing data can be used.   
(Added)  
The sensitivity analysis for the primary 
endpoint will be performed by assuming 
that missing ADHD -RS-5 Total Scores are 
missing not at random (MNAR) meaning 
that the probability that an observation is 
missing may depend on its underlying 
unobserved value.

dose groups are efficacious. If H 01 is 
rejected, then H 02 will be tested. If H 02 is 
rejected, then it will be c oncluded that 
both SPN -812 ER 400 mg and SPN -812 ER 
200 mg are superior to Placebo. If H 02 is 
not rejected, then it will be concluded that 
only SPN -812 ER 400 mg is superior to 
placebo. Then, the sec ond secondary 
endpoint (Conners 3) will be tested in the 
same manner but only using those doses 
that were retained from the primary and 
the first secondary endpoint. Finally, the 
third key secondary endpoint (WFIRS -P) 
will be tested in the same manner but only 
using those doses that were retained from 
the primar y, the first key secondary 
endpoint, and the second key secondary 
endpoints.  
58 7.8.2.2 Additional secondary analyses, 
p.37  
Additional secondary analyses include 
treatment comparisons using ANCOVA or 
ANOVA , on CFB to EOS as appropriate  for 
the following:  
a) WFIRS -P  
b) PSI -4-SF 
c) CGI -S/I 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7.8.2.2 Additional secondary analyses , p.40  
Additional secondary analyses of the 
secondary efficacy variables  will include : 
treatment comparisons using ANCOVA or 
ANOVA on CFB to EOS, as appropriate  for 
the following:  
a) WFIRS P 50% Responder rate for ADHD -
RS-5 - Percent reduction will be calculated 
as: % reduction =  100*(ADHD -RS-5 Total 
Score at Week 8  (EOS) - Baseline ADHD -RS-
5 Total Score)/ Baseline ADHD -RS-5 Total 
Score. The proportion of responders will 
be presented for each treatment group. 
The 2 -sided 95% CI around the difference 
in proportions (SPN -812 ER 200 mg minus 
Placebo, SPN -812 ER 400 mg minus 
Placebo) and the p -value from Pearson’s 
Chi-squared Test or Fisher’s Exact Test  will 
be presented.  
b) PSI -4-SF - The change from baseline in 
PSI-4 total score to Week 8  (EOS) will be 
analyzed using ANCOVA model with fixed 
effects for treatment and baseline as a 
covariate. Each of the treatment groups 
(SPN -812 ER 200 mg and 400 mg) will be 
compared with the Placebo. The p -values, 
LS means of treatment groups, differences 
between the LS means and placebo will be 
presented.  Updated for

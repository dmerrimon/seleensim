1. STUDY OBJE CTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective  
   
LDV/SOF for 12 weeks will have an equivalent SVR12 compared to LDV/SOF+ribavirin 
for 12 weeks, both initiated after liver transplant. 
1.2 Seconda ry Objectives  
Secondary objectives include the emergence and effect of NS5A and NS5B viral substitu-tions at baseline and in the event of relapse. 
2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Rationale  
Therapeutic response rates for the treatment of recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) af ter 
liver transplant have historically lagged behind non- transplant patients (1).  While the lat-
est studies in HCV therapy with new direct- acting antivirals (DAA) have drastically i m-
proved sustained virologic response rates (SVR) in non- transplant patients, HCV is still 
the most common cause of end stage liver disease (ESLD) leading to liver transplant 
(2,3,4,5).  Although the DAAs have shown efficacy in recurrent HCV post-transplant, this is with late treatment, since preemptive therapy has not shown benef it with previous 
agents  (6,7).  An attempt at preventing recurrence by clearing the virus with SOF and 
RBV prior to transplant has shown encouraging preliminary results in patients who had HCV RNA undetectability for ≥ 30 days, however this was in well- compensated cirrho t-
ics (CTP ≤ 7) with concomitant HCC (8).  Due to the poor tolerability of RBV in patients with more advanced cirrhosis, it is unknown if this regimen would have external validity to the overall HCV population awaiting liver transplant.  Also complicating the reprodu c-
ibility of this data is the unpredictable timing of liver transplant surgery.  
Preliminary results of the ongoing SOLAR -1 study have shown excellent sustained viro-
logic response (SVR) rates with 12 weeks of therapy both pre and post-transplant, when utilizing a regimen of LDV/SOF and RBV (9).  However, this is with a regimen that in-cludes an antiviral with poor tolerability post-transplant, ribavirin.   
The predominant remaining questions for post- transplant treatment of HCV in the DAA 
era are whether a ribavirin -free regimen is possible and whether pre- emptive treatment is 
now a potential option to prevent long- term damage to the allograft.

 These questions require formal testing in a clinical trial conducted in transplant centers.

4.3 Study
 Enrollment Procedures 
4.3.1 Subject Identification/Recruitment: Members of the research team will  identify  po-
tentially eligible  patients who are undergoing liver transplantation or have previous-
ly undergone liver transplantation that are infected with Hepatitis C. An initial eval-
uation of existing patient information may be performed to determine potential eli-
gibility.  This initial review may be performed prior to consent; however no proto-
col driven tests or procedures may be performed until signed informed consent has 
been obtained. 
4.3.2 Informed Consent: Authorized personnel will approach patients to explain the study 
and offer the opportunity to participate in the study. The personnel who will obtain

 consent will have completed Human Subjects Protection Training. This research 
study will be explained in lay terms to each potential research participant. In co m-
pliance with  the informed consent process outlined in CFR Title 21 Part 50, the au-
thorized personnel will conduct a face- to-face meeting with the study candidate to 
review all of the required elements of informed consent. The potential study partic i-
pant will sign an informed consent form before undergoing any screening st udy 
procedures. The original consent form will be kept with the subje ct’s file in the o f-
fice. A copy of the consent will be given to the patient and another copy will be put 
in his/her chart. At the time of consent, patients will be assured that their care  will 
not be affected in any way if they choose not to participate in the study. Patients 
will also be reminded that it is their right to withdraw their participation in the study 
at any time.    
4.3.3 Enrollment: Patients who give informed consent to study participation will go on to 
complete baseline procedures necessary to determine eligibility for randomiz ation. 
Once deemed eligible for the study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the 
patient will be enrolled as study subject in the WebDCUTM clinical trial manag e-
ment system (CTMS).  Information to be entered upon enrollment includes demo-
graphic information and date of transplant surgery. Enrolled subjects will be ran-
domized to one of the treatment arms. The study team will receive the randomiz a-
tion assignment from WebDCUTM.

5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration 
i. SOF/LDV administration  
At the time of randomization, all subjects  will be initiated on SOF/LDV 
400mg/90mg enterally daily either with food or on an empty stomach.  This med-
ication will be administered predominantly outpatient, although it may be started 
or co ntinued on both general hospital floors as well as the ICU.  The medication 
will be continued for 12 weeks in both arms.  
ii. Ribavirin administration  
At the  time of randomization, subject s in Arm 2 will be initiated on the appropr i-
ate weight -based dose to be taken with food.  Subject s < 75kg will be initiated on 
RBV 400mg enterally in the morning (QAM) and 600mg enterally at night 
(QPM).  Subject s ≥ 75kg will be initiated on RBV 600mg enterally in the morn-
ing and night (BID).  
This medication will be administered predominantly outpatient, although it may 
be started or continued on both general hospital floors as well as the ICU.   
Ribavirin dosing may be adjus ted as medically required for toxicity (see section 
iii).

 6.2.1 Pre -Randomization Evaluations 
These evaluations occur prior to the subject receiving any study interventions.  
Baseline  
The evaluations listed under the Baseline visit may be performed up to 14 days prior to 
randomization, with the exception of the pregnancy test, which must be performed within 
48 hours of randomization. Additionally, HCV PCRs may be performed up to 30 days prior to randomization, provided t hat it was performed after the liver transplant.  
Once the subject has been successfully screened and accepted for randomization, ran-domization must be complete within 48 hours. All subjects randomized will be included in the intent- to-treat analysis.  
 
6.2.2 Intervention and Evaluations 
Once the subject has been successfully randomized, the intervention should be initiated 
upon that day, but must be initiated within 5 days in case of extenuating circum stances.   
Study evaluations must take place within the time window indicated on the Schedule of Evalu ations (Section 6.1). 
 
6.2.3 Intervention Discontinuation Evaluations At the scheduled time of intervention discontinuation (EOT, last date of study medic a-
tion), the following evalu ations must be completed:  HCV PCR and  HCV viral substitu-
tions (in the event of virologic failure) If a subject  prematurely terminates study intervention, a visit will be scheduled with the 
Princip al-Investigator (PI) or designee within 72 hours to evaluate the reason for early 
termination.  The PI or designee will attempt to resolve any issues leading to early termi-
nation and encourage the subject to resume study intervention as soon as possible.  I t will 
be clarified whether they are terminating from all components of the trial or onl y from 
the primary intervention component of the trial.  If possible, the subjects will be encou r-
aged to continue to be followed and evaluated according to the Schedule of Evaluations (Section 6.1) even if they no longer wish to receive study treatment.  
Subject s that discontinue intervention due to virologic failure will be with drawn from the 
study and deemed a treatment failure.  These subjects may receive altern ative treatment at

Virologic failure , defined as:  
Breakthrough: HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA < LLOQ, 
while on treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values (note: second confirmation 
value can be posttreatment), or last available on -treatment measurement with no su b-
sequent follow up val ues, OR  
Rebound: > 1 log10IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment, 
confirmed with 2 consecutive values (note: second confirmation value can be pos t-
treatment), or last available on -treatment measurement with no subsequent follow up 
values, OR  
Nonresponse: HCV RNA persistently ≥ LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment, OR  
Relapse: HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ during the posttreatment period having achieved HCV 
RNA < LLOQ at end of treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values or last avai l-
able posttreat ment measurement  
 
Pregnancy:  If a woman becomes pregnant or a male’s female partner becomes pregnant while 
on-study, the subject will be required to instruct investigators immediately.  If he/she is in Arm 
1, he/she may remain on therapy but will be ineligible for treatment with ribavirin in the event of 
virologic failure.  If he/she is in Arm 2, therapy must be discontinued immediately and the sub-
ject will be counseled on the potential risks of exposure by the PI or designee.  A discus sion will 
occur with the medical monitor to decide whether the subject is eligible to be continued on 
sofosbuvir/ledipasvir alone.    Loss of graft:  Defined as death or need for retransplant.  Patients will be deemed a treatment 
failure and the intervention will be discontinued. 
 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues  
This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, open-label, intent- to-treat pilot study.   
 
The primary objective is to estimate the effect that  LDV/SOF for 12 weeks will have on 
SVR12 compared to LDV/SOF plus ribavirin for 12 weeks.

  Version 6 
 
 9.2 Outcomes  
9.2.1     Primary outcome - Treatment efficacy, defined as the proportion of subject s 
achieving sustained virologic response 12 (SVR12) weeks after completing the antiviral 
regimen  
9.2.2     Secondary outcomes - Secon dary endpoints include the proportion of subject s 
achieving clearance of viremia during therapy, at the end of therapy, week 4 and 24 SVR (week 4, week 8, EOT, SVR4, SVR24). 
9.2.3     Safety outcomes - Overall safety and tolerability of each regimen will b e estimat-
ed by measuring the incidence of adverse drug reactions and the development of medic a-
tion intolerance requiring dose reduction, temporary withdrawal, or removal of the study 
drug(s), incidence of the need for supportive medications (erythropoi etins, colony-
stimulating factors), incidence of intolerance requiring dose reduction, temporary with-
drawal, or removal of immunosuppressants, overall and opportunistic infections, biopsy-proven rejection rates, death, and graft loss.  Other safety outcomes include virologic mu-
tations based on NS5A and NS5B viral substitutions at baseline and in the event of viro-
logic failure.  
 
9.3 Sample Size Estimation for the Primary Outcome  
For a definitive trial, if we assume  an efficacy rate of 95% with an acceptable noninfer i-
ority margin of 10%, 75 subject s would be needed in each arm to provide an alpha level 
of 0.05 with 80% power to demonstrate noninferiority.  Assuming a 10% dropout rate 
(indicating randomization, but failure to receive a dose of study medication), 85 subject s 
would need to be randomized in each arm.  In this pilot study of 50 subjects, we will be able to obtain estimates of these rates for  the two groups for use in the future definitive 
trial. 
 
9.4 Statistical Evaluation of Primary Endpoint 
9.4.1   S tatistical Hypotheses: 
The specific null and alternative hypotheses for comparing these two treatments in a non -
inferiority design  are: H
0: πLDV/SOF+ribavirin  – π  LDV/SOF  = δo and H A: πLDV/SOF+ribavirin – π  
LDV/SOF  < δo (non- inferior) where δo =0.10. wher e π LDV/SOF+ribavirin  (assumed to be 95%) 
represents the proportion with a successful outcome due to treatment with LDV/SOF plus 
ribavirin for 12 weeks and πLDV/SOF  represents the proportion of a successful outcome 
due to treatment with LDV/SOF for 12 weeks.

9.4.2   Efficacy Analysis:  
Although there is insufficient power to conduct any formal statistical analyses, prelimi-
nary estimates of effects for treatment comprisons  will be intent- to-treat, where all ra n-
domized subject s will be included in the ana lysis and each subject will be included in the 
treatment to which they were randomized.   
Baseline demographics and clinical outcomes will be presented by treatment. Estimates 
of the differences between these, along with 95% confidence intervals, will be generated. 
The prim ary outcome of proportion of subjects with success (defined as the proportion of 
subject s achieving sustained virologic response 12 (SVR12) weeks after completing the 
antiviral regimen) as well as estimates of all secondary outcomes for each treatment will 
be reported along with 95% confidence intervals.  
9.7 Safety Analysis  
9.7.1   Safety Outcomes  
Safety outcomes include the proportion of subjects who experience any treatment- related 
serious adverse events (SAEs) during the treatment phas e and up to 30 days following 
completion of the treatment.  
Overall safety and tolerability of each regimen will be estimated  by measuring the inc i-
dence of:  
• Development of medication intolerance requiring dose reduction, temporary with-
drawal, or removal of the study drug(s)  
• Incidence of the need for supportive medications (erythropoietins, colony-
stimulating factors)  
• Incidence of intolerance requiring dose reduction, temporary withdrawal, or removal of immun osuppressants 
• Overall and opportunistic infections 
• Biopsy-proven rejection rates 
• Mortality  
• Graft loss  
 
Other specific SAEs to be monitored may be added in consultation with the DSMB.  The cumulative incidences of each outcome will be estimated along with 95% confidence in-
tervals.

 9.7.2   Interim Safety Monitoring 
The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) will review study safety event rates, center 
perfo rmance, adverse events (AEs) , and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) periodically.  This 
review will identify any clinical, operational, or other data issues that might require 
changes or adjustments in the way in which the trial is conducted as well as any safety i s-
sues that may need to be addressed.   In order to accommodate this, the Data Coordination 
Unit ( DCU) will generate safety monitoring reports as well a s a comprehensive statistical 
report periodically for the DSMB.  These reports will cont ain compiled data on enrol l-
ment , demographic and baseline characteristics, eligibility and protocol violations, safety 
data, concomitant medications and procedures, and data quality (e.g., timeliness of data entry, and number of data clarification requests generated and resolved).  All AEs and 
SAEs will be  coded using MedDRA and summarized in terms of frequency of the event, 
number of subjects having the event, timing relative to randomization, and severity and relatedness to treatment. For each review, the DCU will generate two statistical r eports – 
an open, blinded report to be distributed to the Executive Committee and the DSMB, and 
a closed report to be distributed only to the DSMB.  For the closed report only, the stati s-
tics will also be provided by partially blinded treatment group (A vs B).  If the DSMB 
wishes to be completely unblinded for closed reports, a sealed treatment identification envelope will be provided to the DSMB; this envelope can be opened at the discretion of 
the DSMB.   The closed report will also contain data listings identifying subjects with 
specific safety ou tcomes such as mortality . 
9.7.3   Stopping the Trial Based on Interim Safety Data 
In case of concern for safety issue arises from DSMB, the trial may be stopped temporari-
ly or permanently if the serious adverse event rate (SAEs related to the study treatment) exceeds a clinically acceptable rate of 10% in either arm.  Data for events will not be 
evaluated until the first 30 subject s have completed 30 day post treatment follow-up for 
each arm . 
 
10. DATA COLLECTION, SITE MONITORING,  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
10.1 Data Processing  
Data management will be handled by DCU.   All study activities will be conducted in 
coordination with the study PI, and will use an electronic data acquisition method where 
all clinical data on enrolled subjects will be entered by the site personnel in real time. The latest version of each CRF will be available as a PDF file on the study website for

 use as worksheets and source documents by study personnel. The study data will be 
managed (including data queries) by DCU using the WebDCU™ system. This user-friendly web -based database system, developed by DCU, will be used for regulator y 
document management, subject randomization, data entry, data validation, project pro-
gress monitoring, subject tracking, user customizable report generation and secure data 
transfer.  
10.2 Data Security and Confidentiality  
During the course of the trial, user access to the files with subject identifiers, treatment assignment and files with study outcomes will be restricted to core staff. In addition to use of passwords and other security measures, all documents containing identifying in-formation on individuals or physicians are considered confidential materials and will be 
safeguarded to the greatest possible extent. No information, which identifies a specific 
person, hospital, or physician, will be released to, or discussed with anyone other than study team members.  
Because the DCU uses a web -based system, source documents and CRFs will remain at 
the partic ipating sites. The study database only identifies study subjects by unique study 
identification codes. All data will be stored in a manner that is HIPAA  compliant, with-
out the ability to track the information back to a specific subject except through a pas s-
word protected system. All collected information about a subject will be stored by a unique identification code. All DCU personnel have cu rrent Human Subjects Protection 
Training Certification. Clinical information will not be released without written permis-sion of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by IRB, the FDA, OHRP, the 
sponsor, or the sponsor’s de signee.  
10.3 Data Quality Assurance 
The study data will be managed (including data queries) by DCU using the WebDCU™ 
system. This user- friendly web -based database system, developed and validated by the 
DCU, will be used for regulatory document management, subject randomization, data en-
try, data validation, project progress monitoring, subject tracking, user customizable r e-
port generation and secure data transfer. In addition to the study database, the DCU will 
provide the clinical site staff access (via password) to a standard set of web -enabled tools, 
including subject visit calendar, subject accrual status, case report form completion st a-
tus, and outstanding data clarification request status pe rtaining to their respective clinical 
sites. Furthermore, all approved study materials, such as the protocol, informed consent template and manual of procedures, will be housed on the website to ensure that the clini-
cal sites always have access to the most current trial documents.

  Version 6 
 
 Data should be independently entered by the designated personnel at each clinical site in-
to WebDCU™ within the time intervals specified in the schedule of assessments.  En-
rollment data, however, must be entered into the WebDCU™ database before the subject 
can be randomized. Serious adverse events must be entered into the WebDCU™ within 
24 hours of the site staff’s first awareness of the event.  It is critically important to the e f-
fective and efficient conduct of the study that data be entered in a timely manner. An 
electronic copy of the CRFs will be made available to the clinical sites prior to initiation of the study to be used as worksheets to capture the required data for the study. The DCU 
staff will perform range verification, consistency checks, and quality assurance on the da-
ta. The staff at the DCU will contact the sites regarding missing data or queries on CRF 
data. They will maintain direct contact with the staff at the participating sites to ensure the study is conducted according to the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and all appl i-
cable regulations.  
Experienced clini cal research monitors will be contracted through the DCU to perform on 
site source data verification (SDV) of key outcome and safety data variables during the 
study.   In addition to data verification, the monitor will evaluate drug accountability and 
site facilities. The CRFs and corresponding source documents should be made available 
to the study monitor at each site visit.  It is also expected that the PI, or a designated 
member of the research staff, will be available during the monitoring visit to review the 
data and resolve any queries.   
10.4 Adverse Experience Reporting  
In order to ensure prompt reporting of adverse events, all adverse events (as well as all related study data) must be entered into the WebDCU
TM within five days of collection 
date. Al l serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported on the WebDCUTM within 24 
hours of the study site staff first being made aware of its occurrence. The site investig a-
tors are required to provide relevant information, including description of the adverse event, date/time of onset and resolution, severity and seriousness, action taken, and sus-
pected relationship to the study treatment.  
Reporting of any serious adverse event will trigger notification of the event to the DCU 
Project Manager (PM) and the indepen dent Medical Safety Monitor (MSM).  The MSM 
will conduct an independent review of each of these events to determine if it is serious, 
unexpected, and study treatment related.    
Periodically throughout the study, the MSM will review reports on the incidenc e rates of 
all re ported adverse events, whether serious or not.  Should such monitoring uncover i s-
sues that may threaten subject safety (e.g. unexpectedly high rate of adverse events), the 
study statistician and principal investigator will prepare a report to be submitted to th e 
DSMB for their review and fu rther actions to be taken, if any.

11. HUMAN SUBJECTS  
11.1   Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review and Informed Consent 
This protocol, the ICF, and any subsequent modifications must be reviewed and approved by 
the local IRB at each of the participating institutions. A signed and dated ICF must be ob-tained from the subject as defined in 21CFR50.3.  The ICF must also be signed and dated by a member of the study staff qualified to be delegated the authority to obtain informed con-
sent, and a witness (if required by the local IRB).  A copy of the ICF must be given to the 
subject  and the consent process must be documented in the subject’s medical record.  The PI 
or delegated sub-Investigator is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is obtained from each patient prior to conducting any study- related activities.  
 No deviations from or changes to the study protocol should be initiated except when nece s-
sary to eliminate immediate hazard to the subject.  However, the IRB, DCU, and Study 
Sponsor must be informed of this as soon as possible thereafter.  It is the study site PI’s r e-
sponsibility to report SAEs occurring during the study to their IRB, as required and as soon as possible.   
 
11.2    Study Modificat ion/Discontinuation  
The study may be modified or discontinued at any time by the IRB, the sponsor, the OHRP, 
the FDA, or other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure that re search subjects 
are pr otected.  
 
12. PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS  
Publication of the results of this trial will be reviewed and approved by all coinvestigators.  
Final results will be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov.  Any presentation, abstract, or man u-
script will be made available for review by the sponsor prior to submission.

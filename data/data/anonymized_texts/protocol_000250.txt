CONFIDENTIAL  SYNOPSIS  
Name of Investigational Product:   INCB0 54828 
Title of S tudy:   A Phase 2, Open-Label, Sing le-Arm, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and 
Safety of INCB054828 in Subjects With Advanced/ Metastatic  or Surgically Unresectable   
Cholangiocarcinoma Including FGFR2 Translocations Who Failed Previous Therapy 
Protocol N umber :  INCB 54828-202 Study Phase:   2 
Indication:   Advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma  
Primary  Objective : 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of INCB054828 in subje cts with 
advanced /metastatic  or surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma with fibroblast growth factor receptor 
(FGFR)  2 translocation  who have failed at least 1 previous treatment. 
Secondary  Objective s: 
•To evaluate the efficacy  of INCB054828 in subjects with advanced/ metastatic  or surgically unre sectable
cholangiocarcinoma with different molecular subgroups .
•To evaluate the safety of INCB054828 in subjects with advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable
cholangiocarcinoma.
•To identify and evaluate covariates that may influence the pharmacokinetics of INCB054828 in thissubject population through population pharmacokinetic analysis.  Additionally, exposure- response
analyses for key efficacy and safety parameters will also be considered if sufficient data are available.
Primary Endpoint : 
The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the objective  respon se rate (ORR)  in subjects with 
FGFR2 translocations  based on the central genomics laboratory  results .  Objective response rate is 
defin ed as the proportion of subjects who achieved a complete response (CR; disappearance of all target 
lesions ) or a partial response ( PR; ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions) 
based on RECIST v ersion 1.1.  Clinical response will be determined by an independent radiological 
review committee.  
Secondary Endpoints:  
•ORR in subjects with fibroblast grow th factor (FGF )/FGFR alterations other than FGFR2 translocations
(Cohort B).
•ORR in all subjects with FGF/FGFR alterations  (Cohorts A and B).
•ORR in subjects negative for FGF/FGFR alterations  (Cohort C [US only] ).
•Progression- free survival (PFS  = first dos e to progressive disease [ PD] or death; all cohorts) .
•Duration of response (DOR = time from the date of CR or PR until PD; all cohorts) .
•Disease control r ate (DCR  = CR + PR  + stable disease ; all cohorts).
•Overall survival (OS  = first dose to death of any c ause; all cohorts) .

Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  • Safety and tolerability will be assessed by evaluating the frequency, duration , and severity of adverse 
events; through review of findings of physical examinations, changes in vital signs , and 
electrocardiogram s; and through clinical laboratory blood and urine sample evaluations (all cohorts).  
• Population pharmacokinetics (all cohorts). 
Overall S tudy Design:    
This is an open-label, monotherapy study of INCB054828 in subjects with advanced /metastatic or 
surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR 2 translocation s, with other FGF/FGFR 
alterations , or who are negative for FGF/FGFR alterations.  The stu dy will enroll approximately 
100 subjects into Cohort A (FGFR2 translocations), 20 subjects into Cohort B (other FGF/FGFR 
alterations) , and 20 subjects into Cohort C ( US only; negative for FGF/FGFR alterations).  Subjects will 
receive a once daily (QD) dose of INCB054828 at 13.5 mg on a 2- week -on therapy and 1- week -off 
therapy schedule.  
Subject  eligibility can be based on local genomic testing results, if available.  Confirmatory testing 
through the central genomics laboratory will be performed on all subjects. 
Genomic testing results will allow subjects to be assigned to a cohort:  
• Cohort A:  FGFR2 translocations with a documented fusion partner in central laboratory report   
• Cohort B:  other FGF/FGFR alterations 
• Cohort C (US only):  negative for FGF/FGFR alterations 
Subjects enrolled based on a local sequencing report will be assigned to a cohort based on the local 
results.  However , final cohort assignment for statistical analysis of primary and secondary endpoints will 
be done based on the central genomics testing results. 
Treatment will start on Day 1.  Subjects will u ndergo regular safety assessments during treatment as well 
as regular efficacy assessments.  Subjects will be allowed to continue administration  in 21- day cycles 
until documented disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is reported. 
Study Population:    
Subjects with advanced /metastatic  or surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR 2 
translocations, with other FGF/FGFR  alteration s, or who are negative for any FGF/FGFR alterations , who 
failed at least 1 previous treatment . 
Key Inclusion Criteria :   
• Men and women, aged 18 or older. 
• Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable 
cholangiocarcinoma.  Subjects will be assigned to one of 3 cohorts: 
− Cohort A:  FGFR2 translocations  with  a documented fusion partner in central lab oratory report  
− Cohort B:  other FGF/FGFR alterations 
− Cohort C (US only):  negative for FGF/FGFR alterations 
• Radiographically measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.  
• Documentation of FGF /FGF R gene alteration status.

CONFIDENTIAL  • Documented disease progressi on after at least 1 line of prior systemic therapy . 
• ECOG performance status of 0  to 2. 
• Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks. 
Key Exclusion Criteria:   
• Prior receipt of a selective FGFR in hibitor. 
• History  of and/or current evidence of ectopic mineralization/calcification, including but not limited to 
soft tissue, kidneys, intestine, myocardia, or lung, except ing calcified lymph nodes and asymptomatic 
arteri al or cartilage/tendon calcific ations. 
• Current evi dence of clinically significant corneal or retinal  disorder  confirmed by ophthalmologic 
examination. 
• Use of any potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers within 14 days or 5 half -lives, whichever is shorter,  
before the first dose of study drug.  Topical ketoconazole will be allowed.  
INCB0 54828, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:    
INCB054828 will be self- administered as a QD oral treatment on a 2 -weeks -on therapy and 1- week -off 
therapy schedule.  Each dose of INCB054828 should be taken immediately upon rising or after a 2 -hour 
fast; subjects will fast for an additional 1 hour after taking study drug.  Tablets will be available in 
strengths of  2 mg and 4.5 mg.  The starting dose will be 13.5 mg.  One cycle will be defined as 21  days.  
Reference Therapy, Dosage , and Mode of Administration:    
Not applicable. 
Study Schedule/Procedures:    
Subjects will have regularly scheduled study visits at the clinical site as part of a 21 -day cycle.  Study 
visits are as follows:  
• Prescreening :  To obtain FGF/FGFR status, if unknown (results within  approximately 2 years of 
screening are valid for this study)  
• Screening :  Day -28 through Day -1 
• Cycle 1 :  Days 1, 8, and 15 
• Cycles 2+:  Day 1  
• End of t reatment  
• Safety follow-up:  30 days (+ 5 days) from date of last dose  
• Follow-up for disease status and survival :  Disease status follow -up every 9 weeks for subjects who 
discontinue for reasons other than disease progression.  Survival f ollow -up every 12 weeks after 
discontinuation.   
Local Laboratory Tests: 
Study visits will include sample collection for hematology, chemistry, coagulation, endocrine monitoring, 
lipids , and urinalysis testing.  Additionally, HIV screening (required for subjects outside of the US) and 
hepatitis screening ( serology) will be done at screening ;  pregnancy testing will be done at screening, 
Day 1 of every cycle before dose administration, and EOT.  FGF/FGFR status may be determined locally.  
Central Laboratory Assessments:  
Tumor tissue will be evaluated through the central laboratory for confirmation of FGF /FGF R alteration 
status.  
Blood samples for population pharmacokinetic analysis  
 will be collected at various timepoints throughout the study and analyzed at the central 
laboratory  or designee.  

Incyte Corporation  Page 6 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  Clinical Assessments : 
Adverse event assessments, vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical examinations, ECOG performance 
status, comprehensive eye examinations, and tumor and disease response assessments will be performed by the investigative site.   
An objective assessment of disease status will be performed at screening.  Subsequently , disease status 
including RECIST radiological response assessment will be assessed  every 2 cycles for the first 4 cycles 
and every 3 cycles thereafter.  A central radiology group will be contracted to provide centralize d reading 
on all assessments.   
Estimated Duration of Participation:    
Up to 28 days are allowed for screening, follow ed by continuous treatment in consecutive 21- day cycles 
as long as subject is receiving benefit and has not met any criteria for study withdrawal, and 30 days 
(+5 days) for safety follow -up following the last dose of the study drug.  Subjects will be followed -up for 
overall survival following documented disease progression. 
Estimated  Number of Subjects:    
Approximately 140 subjects will be enrolled  (approximately 100 subjects in Cohort A, and approximately  
20 subjects into Cohort B and Cohort C [US only]  each). 
Principal Coordinating Investigator:   , MD  
Statistical Methods:    
Primary analysis will be performed on FGFR2 translocated subjects.  Approximately 100 subjects with 
documentation of FGFR2 translocation from the central  genomics la boratory are planned for the final 
analysis of the primary endpoint of ORR .  With the assumed rates of 33% for the intervention, a sample 
size of approximately 100 subjects would provide > 95 % probability to have a 95 % confidence interval 
with lower limit of > 15% assuming 10% lost to follow-up.  Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled in Cohorts 
B and C (US only) , respectively, which will provide > 80% chance of observing at least 4 responders in 
each cohort if the underlying ORR is 30%. 
The proportion of subje cts with ORR and DCR will be estimated with 95%  CI.  The PFS, DOR , and OS 
will be analyzed by the Kaplan -Meier method.  Descriptive statistics will be summarized for safety data.  
Futility Analysis  
For Cohort A (FGFR2 translocations), futility analysis will  be performed  when approximately 25 subjects 
are enrolled into the cohort  and have at least 1 tumor assessment or have permanently discontinued study 
treatment .  Cohort A can be stopped for futility if 2 or less responders are observed, for which there is  less 
than 10% probability of claiming ORR >  15% based on a 60 subject cohort, as initially planned before 
Amendment 5.  This rule is j ust a guidance and nonbinding. 
Cohorts B ( other FGF/FGFR alterations) and C ( US only; negative for FGF/FGFR alterations ) can be 
stopped if 1 or less responders are observed within the first 10 subjects who have at least 2 cycles of data.  
This is just a guidance and nonbinding. 
Data Monitoring Committee:    
No independent Data Monitoring Committee is planned for this study.  A study committee will be 
established and will include the investigators or designees, the sponsor representatives (eg, medical 
monitor), and when appropriate ad hoc experts.

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background  
INCB054828 is an inhibitor of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family of receptor 
tyrosine kinases that is proposed for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.  Aberrant signaling 
through FGFR resulting from gene amplification or mutation, chromosomal translocation, and 
ligand -dependent activation  of the recep tors has been demonstrated in multiple types of human 
cancers.  Fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling contributes to the developing of 
malignancies by promoting tumor cell proliferation, survival, migration, and angiogenesis.  
Incyte is proposing to study INCB054828 for the treatment of advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.  Refer to the Investigator 's Brochure ( IB) for additional 
background information on INCB054828. 
1.1.1. Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Inhibition in Oncology  
The mammalian FGFR family is composed of 4 highly conserved receptors (FGFR1, FGFR2, 
FGFR3, and FGFR4) that have an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane 
domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain.  Eighteen fibroblast growth factor (FGR) 
ligands, divided into canonical and hormonal FGFRs, bind to FGFRs leading to receptor dimerization, activation  of the kinase domain, and transphosphorylation of the receptors 
(Eswarakumar  et al 2005).  Subsequent signal transduction occurs through phosphorylation of 
substrate proteins such as FGFR substrate 2 that leads to activation of the RAS -mitogen -activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase–protein kinase B pathway s 
and phospholipase Cγ that activates the protein kinase C pathway.  In some cellular context, signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins are also activated by FGFRs.  Signaling through the FGF-FGFR pathway is tightly controlled through feedback regulation.  
Mitogen -activated protein kinase phosphatases and Sprouty proteins are upregulated upon FGFR 
stimulation and antagonize FGF- dependent activation of extracellular signal -regulated kinases.  
In many cases, FGFR pathway activation promotes cell proliferation, survival, and migration; however, cellular context plays an important role, and in certain tissues, FGFR signaling results 
in growth arrest and cellular differentiation ( Dailey  et al 2005).  
In adults, FGF- FGFR signaling is involved in angiogenesis during wound healing.  The 
hormonal FGF ligands contribute to regulation of metabolic pathways involving lipid, glucose, phosphate, and  vitamin D ( Itoh 2010) .  Genetic defects in the FGF23 -signaling pathway lead  to 
disordered phosphate metabolism:  loss of function mutations in FGF23 or its signaling result in 
retention of phosphate and tissue mineralizing, while gain of function mutations in the FGF23 
pathway manifests as hypophosphatemic Rickets syndrome ( Farrow  and White 2010).  
There is strong genetic and functional evidence that dysregulation of FGFR can lead to the 
establishment and progression of cancer.  Genetic alterations in FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 
have been described in many tumor types ( Knights and Cook 2010, Turner and Grose 2010 ).  
These include activating mutations, translocations, and gene amplification resulting in ligand 
independent, constitutive activation of the receptors or aberrant ligand -dependent signaling 
through FGFRs.

Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  Dysregulation of FGF ligands has also been reported in many human cancers.  Preclinical studies 
have shown that high levels of FGF ligands such as FGF2 promote cancer cell res istance to 
radiation, chemotherapeutics, and targeted cancer drugs ( Fuks et al 1994, Pardo  et al 2002, 
Terai  et al 2013).  Clinically, detection of high levels of FGF2 in tumors i s associated with 
poorer outcome in several tumor types including NSCLC ( Donnem et al 2009, Rades  et al 2012).  
A substantial body of evidence supports that genetically activated FGFR pathway sensitizes 
FGFR -altered cancer cells to knockdown or inhibition of these receptors ( Kunii et al 2008, 
Qing  et al 2009, Weiss  et al 2010, Lamont et al 2011 ).  A larg e screen of more than 500 tumor 
cell lines with a selective FGFR inhibitor demonstrated that only a small percentage (5.9%) of all cells are sensitive to FGFR inhibition, and growth suppressed cell lines were highly enriched for 
FGFR alterations ( Guagnano  et al 2012).  These results demonstrate that FGFR inhibitors are 
active in a targeted manner against cancers with activated FGFR pathway.  An implication of 
these data is that selection based on molecular -, genetic -, or protein-based diagnostic tests for 
specific FGFR alterations in tumors may be important for identifying patients  most likely to 
benefit from an FGFR inhibitor. 
Results from early clinical studies of selective FGFR inhibitors, including INCB054828 have 
shown a tol erable safety profile for the class and preliminary signs of clinical benefit in subjects 
with FGF/FGFR alterations.  An on -target pharmacologic effect of FGFR inhibition in clinical 
studies is hyperphosphatemia (HP).  In the ongoing INCB 54828-101 study,  at the recommended Phase 2  dose (RP2D) of 13.5 mg, 100% of subjects developed HP  (> 5.5 mg/mL).  
Hyperphosphatemia has been managed with diet modifications and phosphate binders.   
INCB054828 is a potent selective inhibitor of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 and is proposed for 
the treatment of subjects with advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable 
cholangiocarcinoma who have FGFR2 translocation, have other FGF/FGFR alteration , or are 
negative for F GF/FGFR alterations.  
1.1.2. Cholangiocarcinoma 
Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct carcinoma, is found in the intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts.  It is the second most common primary liver cancer but only accounts for approximately 3% of all gastrointestinal cancers ( Rizvi and Gores 2013).  First line therapy is 
typically gemcitabine and cisplatin with a response rate of 30 % to 50% ( Eckman  et al 2011) and 
the 5 -year survival rate is 1 1.5% (NCI  2016). 
The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma is quite rare, with 1 to 2 patients  per 100,000 in regions 
like the US and the UK; however in regions like Southeast Asia, liver fluke and other parasitic infections give rise to a much higher incidence (113 per 100,000; Bergq uist and von Seth 2015).  
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 translocations are the most common FGFR alteration in 
cholangiocarcinoma and associated with a more indolent disease state ( Churi  et al 2014, Wu  et al 
2013).  These fusions are found in 13% to 15% of patients  with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma  
(Graham  et al  2014).  Intrahepatic disease accounts for 5% of all cholangiocarcinoma, with 95% 
of patients  having extrahepatic disease ( Blechacz  and Gores 2008 ) however recent data indicates 
a rise in intrahepatic disease ( Bergquist and von Seth 2015).   Other FGF/FGFR alterations are 
not as common but can be found in the ex trahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients  (Bergquist and 
von Seth 2015).

CONFIDENTIAL  1.2. Study Rationale  
Cancer has several common characteristics that can be observed across numerous tumor types.  
One common characteristic is the uncontrolled growth and survival of cells and their ability to 
become invasive throughout the body.  Fibroblast growth factor signaling produces mitogenic, antiapoptotic, and angiogenic responses in cells, which leads to a deregulated state.  Evidence 
from several in vitro and in vivo tumor models has established the FGFs and FGFRs as 
oncogenes and their expression has been found in numerous solid tumors or hematological malignancies.  Several genetic alterations have been shown to generate overexpression of the 
FGF rece ptor, produce a receptor that is constitutively active, or lead it to a state where there is 
reduced dependence on ligand binding for activation ( Knights and Cook 2010).  
Tyrosine kinases are an especially important target in cancer therapy as they have a key role in growth factor signaling.  Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been shown to be effective 
antitumor agents and have been approved in multiple oncology indications ( Arora  and Scholar 
2005).   INCB054828 is a potent inhibitor of the kinase activity of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 
and has been shown to inhibit growth in several tumor models.   
The planned study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of INCB054828 in subjects 
with advanced/ metastatic or surgically un resectable cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR 2 
translocations, FGF/FGFR alterations and without FGF/FGFR alterations.  Subjects with FGFR2 
translocations are found in approximately 15% of subjects with intrahepatic cholangiocarcino ma 
(Arai et al 2013, Ross et al 2014, Ang  2015 ). 
Preliminary data from the ongoing Phase 1 study INCB54828- 101 has shown a tolerable safety 
profile and signs of efficacy in tumors that have FGF/FGFR genetic alterations.  In the ongoing 
Phase 1  study, more than 25 subjects have been treated at dose levels ranging from 1 to 20 mg 
once daily for 2 weeks followed by 1 week off in 21-day cycles .  The recommended Phase 2  
starting dose has b een established at 13.5 mg once daily following the 2 weeks on/1 week off 
regimen.  This dose was recommended based on safety, pharmacokinetics ( PK), and preliminary 
signals of clinical benefit.  One subject with FGFR2-CCDC6 cholangiocarcinoma has been treated with 9  mg of INCB054828 with a confirmed partial response (PR). 
In addition, a Phase 2 study of BGJ398 in subjects with FGFR- altered cholangiocarcinoma, the 
most frequently reported adverse event (AE)  was HP, followed by fatigue, stomatitis, and 
alopecia.  Hyperphosphatemia was the leading dose- limiting toxicity resulting in interruptions 
and discontinuations.  The effi cacy results of this compound in the ongoing Phase 2  study have 
shown an overall response rate of 18.8% among 48 subjects with FGFR2 fu sions ( Javle et al 
2018).  
Amendment 5 (03 OCT 2017) in creases the number of subjects  enrolled into Cohort A (FGFR2 
translocation) from 60 to 100 subjects.  The rationale for increas ing the number of subjects 
enrolled into this cohort is to  assure the most robust efficacy data to inform future development 
decisions.  As the primary analysis will be based solely on Cohort A, this amendment does not 
increase the number of subjects in Cohorts B and C.  Futility analysis will be performed as 
initially planned ( before  Amendment 5), when approximately 25 subjects are enr olled into 
Cohort A and have at least 1 tumor assessment or have permanently discontinued study 
treatment . 
See Section  9 for the  impact on reporting of the primary endpoint.

CONFIDENTIAL  1.3. Potential Risks and Benefits of the Treatment Regimen  
1.3.1. Potential Risks of INCB054828 Based on Preclinical Safety 
The most prominent findings following repeat-dose exposure to INCB054828 in both rats and 
monkeys were HP, physeal dysplasia, and soft tissue mineralization.  Mineralization was 
observed in numerous tissues including the kidney, stomach, arteries (gastric and pulmonary), 
ovaries (monkey only), and eyes (cornea; rat only).  Soft tissue mineralization was not reversible, while physeal and cartilage findings were reversible.  
Hyperphosphatemia, physeal dysplasia, and soft tissue mineralization have been reported in rodents and large animals following administration of selective FGFR inhibitors ( Brown  et al 
2005, Brown  2010, Wöhrle  et al 2011, Yanochko et al 2013).  These observations can be 
explained by the pharmacological action of FGFR inhibition.  Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23)–mediated signaling negatively affects renal vitamin D biosynthesis by transcriptional 
repression of CYP27B1, which catalyzes the production of the biologically active vitamin D 
metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3, and by induction of CYP24A1, which converts 1,25(OH)2D3 into a 
metabolite that is less biologically active.  Additionally, it has been published that FGF -23 
suppresses renal phosphate reabsorption by decreasing the expression of the sodium-phosphate cotransporters NPT2A and NPT2C in the brush-border membrane of proximal tubule epithelial cells ( Baum  et al 2005, Shimada et al 2001, Shimada et al 2004a , Shimada et al 2004b).  
Wöhrle et al ( 2011) demonstrated that FGFR inhibition by oral administration of PD176067 
counteracts the biologic activity of FGF-23 in the kidney, leading to HP and hypervitaminosis D. 
In rats, the mineralization was similar in distribution and morphology to that occasionally 
observed in normal animals; thus it is likely that the increased incidence of mineralization in 
various tissues at these doses represents a test article–related exacerbation of a spontaneously occurring co ndition.  While soft tissue mineralization was not reversible during 28- day recovery 
period, there was also no evidence of progression or worsening of this effect.  Soft tissue mineralization in monkeys was observed only at 3 mg/kg per day in the 10- day ra nge-finding 
study and was not assessed for reversibility.  No evidence of mineralization was found at the doses tested in the 28-day study in monkeys. 
Moderate lens opacities (capsule, posterior) in one 0.33 mg/kg per day and one 1 mg/kg per day 
males and slight attenuation of retinal vessels in one 1 mg/kg per day female were  observed in 
monkeys at the end-of-treatment (EOT) period on the 28-day Good Laboratory Practice study.  These findings were not present during the pretest period and thus a relationship to INCB054828 cannot be dismissed.  However, lens opacities are occasionally observed in normal cynomolgus 
monkeys of similar age and origin according to the testing facility historical control data.  
Persistence of lens opacity in 1 animal at the end o f recovery period suggests that this finding is 
not reversible. 
Fully reversible mild -to-moderate elevation of alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and aspartate 
aminotransferase ( AST ) were noted at the EOT period in the 28-day monkey study at doses 
≥ 0.33 mg/kg per day; these changes were not associated with changes in other hepatobiliary 
parameters or microscopic changes in the liver.  These changes may be related to FGFR4 
inhibition, which is known to result in increases in liver function tests without histological correlates ( Pai et al 2012 ).

Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  In the 28-day study in rats, no severe toxicity was observed; the no-observed- adverse- effect level 
(NOAEL) was determined as 1.05 mg/kg per day (6.3 mg/m2 per day), the highest dose tested.  
The human equivalent dose (HED) associated with 1.05 mg/kg per day based on standard body 
surface area conversion is 10.1 mg.  In the 28-day monkey study, no severe toxicity was 
observed.  The NOAEL was considered to be 1 mg/kg per day (12 mg/m2 per day), the hi ghest 
dose tested.  The HED associated with 1 mg/kg per day based on standard body surface area 
conversion is 19.2 mg.   
More information can be found in the IB. 
1.3.2. Potential Risks of INCB054828 Based on C linical Safety  
The recommended Phase 2 dose has been selected based from the I NCB 54828-101 study, which is 
the first clinica l study being conduc ted with INCB054828.  Doses ranging from 1 mg to 20 mg 
once daily ( QD) have been eva luated to da te.  Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynam ics have 
been evaluated in e ach of the se cohorts to asse ss the extent of target inhibition, which in turn wa s 
used along with the safet y data to select a  dose for Ph ase 2 studies. 
Of the 60 subjects who have been enrolled into Study INCB 54828-101 as of the data cut off date  
(25 NOV 2016), 22 subjects have been administered INCB054828 in Part 1 (monotherapy dose 
escalation), 21 subjects in Part 2 (monotherapy dose expansion), and 17 subjects in Part 3 
(combination therapy).  The duration of treatment with INCB054828 in Part 1 and Part 2 
combined and Part 3 ranged from 1 to  49 weeks and from 2 to 27 weeks, respectively.  Subject 
exposure is presented in Table 1.  The monotherapy maximum tolerated dose has not been 
reach ed in Part 1.  The maximum safely administered dose was 20  mg.  One dose- limiting 
toxicity  (Grade 3 stomatitis) was observed at 20 mg.  The recommended Part 2 dose has been 
determined at 13.5 mg based on pharmacodynamic and clinical effect.

CONFIDENTIAL  In Parts 1 and 2 combined of S tudy INCB 54828-101, the most f requently reported treatment-
emergent AE ( TEAE) wa s HP (48.8%; serum phospha te > 5.5 mg/dL ), which is expected from 
inhibition of FGFR si gnaling and is used a s a pharmacodynamic m easure in the study.  
Treatment -emergent adver se events, re gardless of causalit y, occurring in ≥ 5% of subj ects are 
presented in Table 2.  Ei ghteen subjects (41.9%) had ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs, 7 of which were 
considered re lated to INCB054828 by the investigator:  fatigue and palmar -plantar 
erythrodysesthesia syndrom e (9 mg dose); convulsion, fatigue, onycholysis, paronychia, and 
stomatitis (13.5 mg dose); and s tomatiti s and palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome 
(20 mg dose). 
Thirt een subjec ts experienced 21 serious AEs  (SAEs ).  Serious AEs  that occurred in more than 
1 subject were pneumonia (9.3%) and disease progression (4.7%).  In the 13.5 mg dose cohort, 
1 SAE of seizure was conside red rela ted to stu dy dru g by the investigator; the subject was 
hospitalized, received treatment for the seizure, the event resolved, and the subject subsequently 
died due to disease progression.  Additionally, the subject had underlying history of cardiovascular 
disease, hypertension, and orthostatic hypotension.  No other SAEs were considered related to study drug .  Four subjects had fatal events:  disease progression (2 subjects), pneumonia, and 
intracranial hemorrhage (1 subject each).  
Nine SAEs in  6 subjects in Part 1 and Part 2 were identified from the safety database.  In the 
9 mg dose cohort, 1 subject had SAEs of dyspnea and musculoskeletal chest pain.  In the 
13.5 mg cohort, 1 subject had 2 SAEs of pneumonia and 1 SAE of atrial fibrillation, and 
3 subjects had SAEs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, disease progression, and vomiting (1 subject per event).  In the 20 mg cohort, 1 subject had an SAE of pulmonary 
embolism.  The SAE of disease progression was fatal.  None of the SAEs were considered 
related to INCB054828 by the investigator. 
One subject, receiving 4 mg of INCB054828, permanently discontinued treatment of 
INCB054828 because of a TEAE (depressed level of consciousness due to progressive disease of 
the brain).

CONFIDENTIAL  In Part 3 of Study INCB 54828-101, the most f requently reported T EAE was HP (58.8%; serum 
phospha te > 5.5 mg/dL ).  Oth er TEA Es, re gardless of causalit y, occurring in 2 or more subjects 
are presented in the IB (version 3, Table 17 ).  Eight subjects (47.1%) had  ≥ Grade 3 TE AEs, 
3 of which were considered re lated to INCB054828 by the investigator:  neutropenia in the 
docetaxel + INCB054828 13.5 mg cohort (Grade 4), ALT increased in the gemcitabine + 
cisplatin + INCB054828 13.5 mg cohort (Grade 3), and platelet count decreased in the gemcitabine + cisplatin + INCB054828 9 mg cohort (Grade 3). 
Seven subjects had 13 SAEs.  In the gemcitabine + cisplatin + INCB054828 cohorts, the SAEs 
were constipation and febrile neutropenia (INCB054828 9 mg) and disease progression, esophageal candidiasis, dehydration, and acute renal failure (INCB054828 13.5 mg).  In the 
docetaxel + INCB054828 13.5 mg cohort, the SAEs were anemia, tumor hemorrhage, and 
abdominal pain.  In the pembrolizumab + INCB054828 cohort, the SAEs were completed suicide (INCB054828 9 mg), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and hypotension (INCB054828 13.5 mg 
each subject).  No SAEs occurred in more than 1 subject, and no SAEs were considered related 
to INCB054828 by the investigator.  Two subjects had fatal events in Part 3:  completed suicide (pembrolizumab + INCB054828 9 mg) and disease progression (gemcitabine + cisplatin + INCB054828 13.5 mg). 
In Part 3, 3 SAEs in 3 subjects were identified from the safety database.  In the docetaxel + 
INCB054828 13.5 mg cohort, 1 subject had an SAE of enterocolitis, and another subject had an 
SAE of pulmonary embolism.  One subject in the pembrolizumab + INCB054828 cohort had an 
SAE of femur fracture.  None of the SAEs were considered related to INCB054828 by the investigator.  
One subject permanently discontinued treatment of INCB054828 in the gemcitabine + cisplatin + INCB054828 13.5 mg cohort because of TEAEs (disease progression and acute renal failure).

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1. Study Objectives  
2.1.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of INCB054828 in subjects with advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 translocation who have failed at least 1 previous treatment.  
2.1.2. Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives are:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of INCB054828 in subjects with advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma with different molecular subgroups.   
• To evaluate the safety of INCB054828 in subjects with advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable cholangiocarcinoma . 
• To identify and evaluate covariates that may influence the PK of INCB054828 in this 
subject population through population PK  analysis.  Additionally, exposure-response 
analyses for key efficacy and safety parameters will also be considered if sufficient data are available.  
2.2. Study Endpoints  
The genomi c testing results from the central laboratory will be used to determine cohort 
allocation for primary and secondary endpoint analyses. 
2.2.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the objective response rate (ORR) in subjects with FGFR2 translocations  based on the central genomics laboratory results.  Objective response 
rate is defined as the proportion of subjects  who achieved a complete response ( CR; 
disappearance of all target lesions ) or a PR (≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the lo ngest diameters 

Incyte Corporation  Page 26 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  of target lesions ) based on RECIST v 1.1.  Clinical response will be determined by an 
independent radiological review committee.  
2.2.2. Secondary Endpoint s 
The secondary endpoints for this study include: 
• ORR in subjects with FGF/FGFR alterations othe r than FGFR2 translocations 
(Cohort B). 
• ORR in all subjects with FGF/FGFR alterations  (Cohorts A and B). 
• ORR in subjects negative for FGF/FGFR alterations  (Cohort C [US only]). 
• Progression- free survival (PFS  = first dose to progressive disease [ PD] or deat h; all 
cohorts). 
• Duration of response (DOR = time from the date of CR or PR until PD; all cohorts). 
• Disease control r ate (DCR  = CR + PR  + stable disease [ SD]; all cohorts). 
• Overall survival (OS = first dose to death of any cause ; all cohorts). 
• Safety and tolerability will be assessed by evaluating the frequency, duration , and 
severity of AEs; through review of findings of physical examinations, changes in vital 
signs , and electrocardiograms ( ECGs ); and through clinical laboratory blood and 
urine sample eval uations (all cohorts). 
• Population PK (all cohorts).

CONFIDENTIAL  4. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
4.1. Overall Study Design  
This is an open- label, mo notherapy study of INCB054828 in subjects with advanced/metast atic 
or surgically unres ectable cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 translocations, with other 
FGF/FGFR alterations , or who are negative for FGF/FGFR alterations.  The study will enroll 
approximately 140 subjects total:  100 subjects with FGFR2 translocations (Cohort A), 
20 subjects with other FGF/FGFR alterations (Cohort B) , and 20 subjects with no FGF/FGFR 
alterations ( Cohort C [US only] ). 
Subjects will receive a once daily dose (QD) of INCB054828 at 13.5 mg on a 2- week -on therapy 
and 1- week -off therapy schedule.  F ull study drug administration information  can be found in 
Section  5.2. 
Subject eligibility can be based on local genomic testing results, if available.  Confirmatory 
testing through the central genomics laboratory will be performed on all subjects. 
Previous therapies may include chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapies, with or without 
radiotherapy.  Subjects receiving radiotherapy to target lesion (s) must show progression of target 
lesion before  entry into the study. 
Genomic testing results will allow subjects to be assigned to a cohort:  
• Cohort A:  FGFR2 translocations  with a documented fusion partner in central 
laboratory report 
• Cohort B:  other F GF/FGFR alterations  
• Cohort C (US only):  negative for FGF/FGFR alterations 
Subjects enrolled based on a local sequencing report will be assigned to a cohort based on the local results.  However , final cohort assignment for statistical analysis of primary a nd secondary 
endpoints will be done based on the central genomics testing results. 
Treatment will start on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Subjects will undergo regular safety assessments during 
treatment as well as regular efficacy assessments.  Subjects will be allowed to continue 
administration  in 21-day cycles until documented disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is 
reported.  See Figure  3 for the study design.

CONFIDENTIAL  4.3. Number of Subjects  
4.3.1. Planned Number of Subjects  
Approximately 140 subjects (total) are planned for enrollment.  This may vary due to outcome of 
futility analysis.  
4.3.2. Replacement of Subje cts 
Not applicable. 
4.4. Duration of Treatment and Subject Participation  
After signing the ICF, screening assessments may be completed over a period of up to 28 days.  Each subject enrolled in the study may continue to receive study treatment in continuous 21-day 
cycles.  At the point when the subject discontinues study drug  (INCB0 54828), the treatment 
period will end and the subject will enter the follow -up period (see Section  6.4).  Study 
participation is expected to  average approximately 6  months per individual subject. 
4.5. Overall Study Duration  
The study begins when the first subject signs the ICF.  The end of the study will occur  when all 
subjects have discontinued study drug and h ave completed applicable follow -up as sessments. 
If there have been ≤ 2 subjects on study for more than 8 months, then a database lock of the 
study may occur to allow the analysis of the study data.  Any remaining subjects may continue to 
receive study treatment  per Protocol.  The remaining subjects are considered to be on study until 
a discontinuation criterion is met and written notification is provided to the  sponsor. 
4.6. Study Termination  
The investigator retains the right to terminate study participation at any time, according to the 
terms spe cified in the study contract.  The investigator is to notify the institutional review board  
(IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC)  in writing of the study 's completion or early 
termination, send a copy of the notification to the sponsor or sponsor' s desi gnee , and retain 
1 copy for the site study regulatory file.  
The sponsor may terminate the study electively, if required by regulatory decision, or upon 
advice of the study committee .  If the study is terminated prematurely, the sponsor will notify the 
investigators, the IRB s and I ECs, and regulatory bodies of the decision and reason for 
termination of the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  5. TREATMENT  
5.1. Treatment Assignment  
5.1.1. Subject Numbering and Treatment Assignment  
The interactive response technology ( IRT) will be contacted at the beginn ing of screening to 
obtain a subject number.  All subject numbers will be 6 digits; the first 3 digits will be the site 
number, and the last 3 digits will be the subject 's number.  This subject number will be 
maintained throughout the study and will not be reassigned.  Subjects who withdraw consent or 
discontinue from the study after being assigned a subject number will retain their initial number.  
Site staff will contact the IRT after screening is completed to enroll the subject and to allocate 
the subject  to treatment assignment and obtain the initial study drug assignment.  The 
investigator or d esignee will select the appropriate number of bottles of study drug from their 
stock that correspond to the dose provided by the I RT and dispense the study drug to the subject.  
All subsequent dispensing of study drug should follow this process.  Refer to the IRT manual for 
detailed information.  
If a subject is mistakenly given a bottle of study drug that is not the bottle assigned by the IRT, 
the IRT help desk must be notified immediately.  The reason for the misallocation of the study 
drug must be documented by the study site and reported to the IRB/IEC. 
For subjects who signed an ICF but are not allocated and for subjects who are allocated but were 
not treated, re fer to the electronic case report form ( eCRF ) Completion Guidelines for instruction 
on which eCRFs to complete. 
All subjects will receive the same treatment assignment (13.5  mg QD) regardless of cohort 
assignment.  
5.1.2. Randomization and Blinding  
Not applicable, since this is an open- label , single -group study.  
5.2. Study Drug

All Incyte investigational product labels will be in the local language and will comply with the 
legal requirements of each country. 
5.2.1.3. Storage 
Bottles of tablets should be stored at room temperature, 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). 
5.2.1.4. Instruction to Subjects for Handling Study Drug (INCB 054828) 
The subject must be instructed in the handling of study drug  as follows: 
• To store the study drug  at room temperature.  
• To only remove from the study drug bott le the number of tablets needed at the time of 
administration.  
• Not to remove doses in advance of the next scheduled administration. 
• Tablets cannot be split or crushed 
• To make every effort to take doses on schedule. 
• To report any missed doses. 
• To take study drug immediately upon rising or after a 2 -hour fast with a glass of 
water; the subject should refrain from eating  1 hour after taking study drug. 
• If the subject vomits after taking study drug, the subject should not take another dose 
that day. 
• To keep stu dy drug in a safe place and out of reach of children. 
• To bring all used and unused study drug  kits to the site at each visit. 
• If a dose of INCB 054828 is missed by more than 4 hours, that dose should be skipped 
and the next scheduled dose should be administ ered at the usual time.  
5.3. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with all study -related treatments  should be emphasized to the subject by the site 
personnel, and appropriate steps should be taken to optimize compliance during the study.  
Compliance with INCB054828 will be calculated by the sponsor based on the drug 
accountability documented by the site staff and monitored by the sponsor/designee (tablet counts).  Subjects will be instructed to bring the study drug  with them to the study visits in order 
for site pers onnel to conduct tablet counts to assess study drug accountability.  The drug 
accountability documentation will be used by the sponsor to calculate treatment compliance.

CONFIDENTIAL  5.4. Treatment Interruptions and Adjustments  
5.4.1. Dose Modifications 
Dose interruptions and modifications may occur for individual study subjects.  The occurrence of 
toxicities (related or unrelated to study drug) will guide decisions for treatment interruptions and 
discontinuation for individual subjects.  
5.4.2. Criteria and Procedures for Dose Interrupti ons and Adjustments  of Study Drug  
Treatment with INCB0 54828 may be delayed up to 14 days to allow for resolution of toxicity  
(Table 3) .  Subjects may resume treatment if no medical condition or other circumstance ex ists 
that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for further 
participation in the study.  The treating investigator should contact the sponsor to discuss the 
case of any subject whose treatment has been delayed for more than  14 days before restarting 
treatment with INCB0 54828. 
Table 3: Guidelines for Interruption and Restarting of Study Drug  
ADVERSE EVENT  ACTION TAKEN 
Chemistry  
• AST and/or ALT is > 5.0 × ULN . 
Note:  In subjects with liv er 
metastasis- related elevations at baseline, 
contact sponsor to discuss clinical 
management and possible dose reductions. Step 1:   Interrupt study drug up to 2 weeks (14 days) until 
the toxicity has resolved to ≤ Grade 1 except by approval of 
the medical monitor.  
Step 2:   Restart study drug at same dose.  If assessed as 
related to study drug, restart study drug at next lower dose; monitor as clinically indicated.  
Other toxicities , including SRD/RPED  
• Any Grade 1 or Grade 2 toxicity. Continue study drug treatment and treat the toxicity; monitor as clinically indicated.  
• Any Grade 3 toxicity, if clinically significant and not manageab le by 
supportive care. Step 1:   Interrupt study drug up to 2 weeks (14 days), until 
toxicity r esolves to ≤ Grade 1. 
Step 2:   Restart study drug at same dose.  If assessed as 
related to study drug, restart study drug at next lower dose; monitor as clinically indicated.  
• Any recurrent Grade 3 toxicity after 2 dose reductions . Discontinue study drug administration and follow- up per 
Protocol.  (Exceptions require approval of sponsor.)  
• Any other Grade 4 toxicity. Discontinue study drug administration and follow- up per 
Protocol. 
For subjects who present with possible or confirmed serous retinal detachme nt/retinal pigmented 
epithelium detachment (SRD/RPED) based on optic coherence tomography (OCT ), the 
guidelines in Table 3 should be followed.  It is recommended to discuss the findings with the 
Incyte medical monitor before making changes to the subject' s treatment.  
Incyte Corporation  Page 36 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  Per CTCAE v4.03, there is a grading for retinal detachment ; however, this refers to 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (when a hole occurs in the retina)  or exudative detachment 
(fluid accumulation due to inflammatory diseases) .  There is no exact  CTCAE grading term  for 
SRD/RPED  secondary to FGFR inhibition (there is no hole in the macula, just fluid 
accumulation  or detachment of retinal pigmented epithelium).  Therefore, grading should be 
based on the CTC AE term "retinopathy ." 
Due to the fact subjects may enter the study with extensive pretreatment toxicities, the dose 
reduction rules are provided as guidelines (see Table  3). 
For dose adjustments, the sponsor recomm ends a maximum of 2 dose level reductions:  subjects 
administered  13.5 mg can decrease to 9  mg, and if additional dose reduction is required, subjects 
can decrease to  6 mg.   Dose reductions below 6 mg are not allowed.  The frequency of 
administration  remains the same (once daily) and as well as the schedule (2 weeks on treatment 
followed by 1 week off treatment). 
Adverse events that have a clear alternative explanation or transient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal 
laboratory values without associated clinically significant signs or symptoms may be exempt from dose-reduction rules. 
5.4.3. Management of Hyperphosphatemia 
Hyperphosphatemia is an expected on -target pharmacologic effect of FGFR inhibition.  
Hyperphosphatemia should be managed with diet modifications, phosphate binders and diuretics, 
or a dose reduction per the recommendations in Table 4 .

CONFIDENTIAL  5.4.4. Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
The occurrence of unacceptable toxicity not caused by the underlying malignancy will be 
presumed to be related to study drug treatment and will require that the study drug be 
permanently discontinued.  Unacceptable toxicity is defined as follows: 
• Occurrence of an AE that is related to treatment with the study drug that , in the 
judgment of the investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor, compromises the 
subject 's ability to continue study -specific procedures  or is considered to not be in the 
subject 's best interest.  
• An AE requiring more than 2 dose reductions. 
• Persistent AE requiring a delay of therapy for more than 21 days unless a greater 
delay has been approved by the sponsor. 
• Increase in QT/QTcF to > 500 milliseconds or to > 60 milliseconds o ver baseline.   In 
case of a QTc > 500 m illiseconds, the subject  must be hospitalized and a continuous 
ECG monitoring must be set up until the measure of the QTc interval decreases below 
500 m illiseconds  and until acceptable in the opinion of a local cardio logist.  
5.5. Withdrawal of Subjects  From Study Treatment  
5.5.1. Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects must  be withdrawn from study treatment for the following reasons: 
• The subject becomes pregnant. 
• Consent is withdrawn.  Note  Subjects may choose to discontinue study treatment and remain in the study to be followed for progression and survival. 
• Further treatment  would be injurious to the subject's health or well-being, in the 
investigator 's medical judgment.   Subject would still be followed for progression and 
survival. 
• The stu dy is t erminated  by the sponsor. 
• The study is t erminated  by the lo cal health authority, IRB, or IEC. 
• Unacceptable toxicity has occurred . 
• Disease progression has been reported . 
• Other anti neoplastic treatment is initiated . 
A subject  may be discontinued from study treatment as follows:  
• If, during the course of the study, a subject is found not to have met eligibility criteria but is receiving clinical benefit as per the investigator , the m edical monitor, in 
collaboration with the i nvestigator, will determine whether the subject sho uld be 
withdrawn from the study.  This includes cases where the local genomic testing result is positive for an FGF/FGFR alteration but the central genomic testing is  not. 
• If a subject is noncompliant with study procedures or study dr ug administration in the 
investigator's opinion, the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on handling the subject.  
Incyte Corporation  Page 38 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  5.5.2. Withdrawal Procedures  
In the event that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study drug , the subject will 
be withdrawn from the study and the end- of-treatment  visit should be conducted.  Reasonable 
efforts should be made to have the subject  return for a follow-up visit.   These visits are described 
in Section 6.  The last date of the last dose of study drug and the reason for subject withdrawal 
will be recorded  in the e CRF . 
5.6. Withdrawal of Subjects  From Study  
If the subject discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of 
follow-up data (safety follow-up or disease assessment), then no additional data collection 
should occur; however, subjects will have the option of withdrawing consent for study treatment 
but continuing in the follow-up period of the study for safety/efficacy assessments. 
5.7. Concomitant Medications  
5.7.1. Restricted Medications  
The use of mild or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and OCT2 substrates, such as metformin, should involve careful monitoring in relation to safety . 
Calcium -based phosphate binding medications should not be used due to a concern for soft tissue 
mineralization.  
5.7.2. Prohibited Medications  
The following medications and measures are prohibited: 
• The concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers and 
moderate CYP3A4 inducers.  Based on the low overall bioavailability of t opical 
ketoconazole, there are no restrictions on topical ketoconazole.  See Appendix B  for a 
list of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. 
• Any concomitant use of a selective FGFR inhibitor (other than the study drug) 
• Investigational study drug for any indication. 
• Use of any anticancer medications other than the study medication.  
6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
All study assessments will be performed as indicated  in the schedule of assessments ( Table 5 ),

CONFIDENTIAL  6.1. Prescreening and Screening  
Prescreening is available for subjects without a genomic testing  report  (results within 
approximately 2 years of screening are valid for this study ).  Prescreening allows genomic 
testing to be performed outside of the 28-day screening window. 
Screening is the interval between signing the ICF and the day  that the subject is enrolled in the 
study (Cycle  1 Day  1).  Screening may not exceed 28  days.  Assessments that are required to 
demonstrate eligibility may be performed over the course of 1 or more days during the screening 
process.  
Procedures  conducted as part of the subject' s routine clinical management (eg, blood count, 
imaging study) and obtained before signing of informed consent may be us ed for screening or 
baseline purposes provided that the procedure meets the Protocol- defined criteria and has been 
performed in the time  frame of the study (ie, within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1).  All information 
associated with eligibility requirements must be entered into the appropriate eCRF pages . 
Results from the screening visit evaluations will be reviewed to confirm subject eligibility  before 
enrollment or the administration of study drug.  Tests with results that fail eligibility requirements may be repeated once during screening if the investigator believes the results to be in error.  For screening assessments that are repeated, the most recent available result before 
treatment assignment will be used to determine subject eligibility.  Treatment should start as 
soon as possible, but within 3 days after the date of enrollment.  Additionally, a subject who fails screening may repeat the screening process 1  time if the investigator believes that there has  been 
a change in eligibility status (eg, after recovery from an infection).   Subjects who are rescreened 
will receive a new subject number through the IRT. 
6.2. Treatment  
The treatment period begins on the day that  the subject receives the first dose of study drug 
(Cycle 1 Day 1) through the point at which the investigator  determines that the subject will be 
permanently discontinued from study drug.  Cycle 1 Day 1  must be no more than 28 days after 
the subject has signed the ICF and no more than 3 days after the date of enrollment.  Dates for subsequent study visits will be determined based on this day and should occur within 3 days (+/- ) 
of the scheduled date unless delayed for safety reasons.  At Cycle 1 Day 1, results from screening visit evaluations should be reviewed to determine whether  the subject continues to 
meet the eligibility requirements , as specified in the Protocol. 
6.3. End of Treatment 
When  the subject permanently discontinues study dr ug, the EOT visit should be conducted.  If 
the EOT  visit coincides with a regular study visit,  then  the EOT  evaluations will supersede those 
of that scheduled visit, and the data should be entered in the EOT  visit in the e CRF .  The subject 
should be encouraged to return for the follow-up v isit.

Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  6.4. Follow -Up 
6.4.1. Safety Follow- Up 
The safety follow-up period  is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow-up 
visit, which should occur 30 to 35 days after the EOT visit (or after the last dose of study drug  if 
the EOT visit was not performed).  A dverse events  and SAEs must be reported up until at least 
30 days after the last dose of study drug , the date of the follow-up visit, or until toxicities 
resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, whichever is longer.  Reasonable efforts 
should be made to have the subject return for the follow-up visit and report any AEs that may occur during this period. 
If a subject is scheduled  to begin a new anticancer therapy before the end of the 30- day safety 
follow-up period, then the safety follow -up visit should be performed before new anticancer 
therapy is started.  Once new anticancer therapy has been initiated, the subject will move into the 
survival follow-up period. 
6.4.2. Disease Status  Follow- Up 
Subjects who discontinue study treatment for a reason other than disease progression will move 
into the disease status follow -up period and should be assessed every 9 weeks by radiologic  
imaging to monitor disease status.  Every effort should be made to collect information regarding disease status until: 
• The start of new antineoplastic therapy.  
• Disease progression . 
• Death . 
• The end of the study.  
6.4.3. Survival Follow- Up 
Once a subject has received the last dose of study drug, confirmed disease progression, or starts a 
new anticancer therapy, the subject moves into the survival follow-up period and should be contacted by telephone, email, or visit at least every 12 weeks to assess for survival status until 
death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs fir st. 
6.5. End of Study  
The end of the study may be designated as the timepoint when all subjects have discontinued the study or the sponsor terminates the study. 
6.6. Unscheduled Visits 
Unscheduled visits may occur at any time as medically warranted.  Any assessments  performed 
during those visits should be recorded in the eCRF.

Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  7. CONDUCT OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
7.1. Administration of Informed Consent Form  
A valid informed consent must be obtained from the study subject before any study- specific 
procedures are conducted using an ICF approved by the local IRB/IEC that contains all elements 
required by ICH E6 and describes the nature, scope, and pos sible consequences of the study  in a 
form understandable to the study subject.  Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and 
administration must be followed; the original signed ICF must be retained by the investigator, 
and a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  The informed consent process for each subject must be documented in writing w ithin the  subject source documentation. 
7.2. Interactive Response Technology  Procedure 
The IRT will be contacted to obtain a subject ID number when a subject enters screening.  Upon 
determining that the subject is eligible for study entry, the IRT will be contacted to obtain the 
treatment  assignment.   Additionally, the IRT will be contacted at each regular study visit to 
update the study drug  supply.  See appropriate information  in Section  5.1.1. 
7.3. Demography and Medical History 
7.3.1. Demographics and General Medical History  
Demographic data and general medical history  will be collected at  screening.  
7.3.2. Disease Characteristics and Treatment History  
A disease- targeted medical and medication history will be collected at screening.  
7.4. Prior and Concomitant Medication s and Procedures  
Prior and concomitant medications and procedures will be reviewed to determine subject 
eligibility.  All concomitant medications and measures  must be recorded in the e CRF , and a ny 
medication received  or procedure performed within 28 days before first dose  and up to the end of 
study will be recorded in the e CRF.  The medication record will be maintained  after  signing the 
ICF to document concomitant medications , including any changes to the dose or regimen.  
Concomitant medications include any prescription, over-the-counter, or natural/herbal preparations taken or administered during the study period.  Concomitant treatments  and/or 
procedures that are required to manage a subject 's medical condition during the st udy will also be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
7.5. Safety Assessments  
7.5.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subject  signs the ICF .  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AE s 
throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, 
Incyte Corporation  Page 46 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling? "  All AEs (serious and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and e CRFs  regardless of the ass umption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug .  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in  Section  8. 
7.5.2. Physical Examinations 
Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the 
investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, physician 's assistant, or an advanced registered nurse p ractitioner, as local law 
permits.  
Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significan t in the judgement of the 
investigator are to be reported as AEs.  
7.5.2.1. Comprehensive Physical  Examination 
The comprehensive physical examination will in clude height (at screening) and body weight and 
assessment(s)  of the following organ or body systems:  skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; 
thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system ; abdomen (liver, spleen) ; extremities ; and lymph nodes, as 
well as  a brief neurological exam ination . 
7.5.2.2. Targeted Physical  Examination 
The targeted physical examination will be a symptom- directed evaluation.  The targeted physical 
examination will include body weight and assessment(s)  of the body systems or organs, as 
indicated by subject symptoms, AEs, or other findings.   
7.5.3. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature.  
Blood pressure and pulse will be taken with the subject in the recumbent, semirecumbent, or 
sitting position after approximately 5 minutes of rest.   Clinically notable abnormalities that are 
considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs . 
7.5.4. Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be performed with the subject in a recumbent or semi recumbent  position 
after 5  minutes of rest.  
The 12- lead ECGs will be interpreted by the investigator at the site  to be used for immediate 
subject management.   The decision to include or exclude a subject or withdraw a subject from 
the study based on an ECG flagged as " Abnormal, Clinically Significant " is the responsibility of 
the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor' s medical monitor, as appropriate.  C linically 
notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator 
are to be reported as AEs.

Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  7.5.5. Comprehensive Eye Examination 
A comprehensive eye examination should be performed by a qualified ophthalmologist at 
screening, once every 3 cycles (± 14 days, starting at Cycle 3), at EOT, and as clinically 
indicated.  The eye examination should include a visual acuity test, slit- lamp examination, 
funduscopy with digital imaging, and OCT.  Every effort should be made to ensure that all subsequent examinations are performed by the same ophthalmol ogist . 
7.5.6. Laboratory Assessments 
Each site 's local laboratory will be used for eligibility and ongoing safety assessments.  
Chemistry, hematology, coagulation panel, lipid panel, serology, endocrine function, and urinalysis will all be analyzed by each site 's laboratory. 
7.5.6.1. Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test will be required for all women  of childbearing potential during 
screening .  A urine pregnancy test is allowed on Day 1 (before the first dose of study drug), 
Day 1 of each subsequent cycle, and at the EOT visit.  Urine pregnancy tests will be conducted 
as outlined in Table 6 , as medically indicated , or per country- specific requirement.  Urine 
pregnancy tests will be performed  locally.   If a urine pregnancy test is  positive, the results should 
be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test.  
If the serum pregnancy test is negative after a urine test was positive , then t he investigator will 
assess the potential benefit/risk to the subject and  determine whether  it is in the subject 's best 
interest to resume study drug and continue participation in the study. 
7.5.6.2. Hepatitis Screening Tests  
Subjects will undergo screening for hepatitis B or C through their local laboratory.  If the results 
are positive, then subjects will be required to undergo additional testing.  Subjects with chronic 
or cleared hepatitis B or C will be allowed to enroll.  Chronic is defined as subjects with no 
evidence of liver cirrhosis or active hepatitis (elevation of transaminases) but with positive anti-HCV a ntibody test or positive HCV RNA, positive HBV surface antigen , or positive HBV 
DNA.  
7.5.6.3. HIV Screening Tests  
Subjects outside of the US will be required to submit to an HIV test during screening to ensure negative HIV status before enrollment/Cycle 1 Day 1.  T his test is optional for US subjects.  
7.5.6.4. Evaluation of FGF and FGFR Genetic Alterations 
All potential subjects must be evaluated for FGF/FGFR alteration status before  enrollment.  
Subject eligibility can be based on local genomic testing results, if available .  Confirmatory 
testing through the central genomics laboratory will be performed on all subjects.  See  Appendix D  for a list of alterations.

CONFIDENTIAL  7.6. Efficacy Assessments  
7.6.1. Tumor Imaging 
Objective assessment of tumor stat us is required using appropriate disease-specific techniques, 
and a central radiologic facility will be used to determine responses and will be logged in to  the 
eCRF.  RECIST v1.1 ( Eisenhauer  et al 2009) will be used, and the recommended method for 
measuring and following tumor burden will be CT scan, to include the thorax, abdomen, and 
pelvis; the neck can be included if needed.  Alternative modalities (eg, MRI) may be substituted 
for a CT scan at the discretion of the investigator, provided that the same modality is used throughout the study and that the m ethodolo gy is consistent with RECIST v1.1. 
The schedule for efficacy assessments will be at screening (this will be considered the baseline scan) , every 2 cycles (every 6 we eks) for the first 4 cycles , every 3 cycles  (every 9  weeks) 
thereafter , and then at EOT  (if applicable) .  For subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons 
other than disease progression, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status by radiographic imaging until 1) start of new anticancer therapy, 2) documented disease 
progression, 3) death, or 4) end of study, whichever occurs first. 
7.6.2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status  
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group perform ance status ( Table 8) will be assessed at the visits 
specified in the schedule of assessments ( Table 5 ). 
Table 8: ECOG Performance Stat us 
Grade  Performance Status  
0 Fully active, able to carry on all predisease performance without restriction . 
1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a 
light or sedentary nature, eg, light house work, off ice work . 
2 Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities.  Up and 
about more than 50% of waking hours . 
3 Capable of only limited self -care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours.  
4 Completely disab led.  Cannot carry on any self -care.  Totally confined to bed or chair . 
5 Dead .

7.6.4. Su
rvival Follow- Up 
For subjects having entered the survival follow-up period of the study , the site will use 
continuing subject  records to supply data on subsequent tr eatment regimens, tumor assessments 

Incyte Corporation  Page 49 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  (if discontinued treatment for a reason other than progression), and OS in the e CRF.  For subjects 
who do not intend to return to the study investigator for their ongoing care, follow-up should be 
maintained by phone con tact, patient  records, and public records/databases at intervals of no 
longer than 12 weeks.  After the final primary analysis is performed, the follow -up interval for 
subsequent anticancer  treatments and survival may  be reduced to every 12 weeks (see 
Section 6.4).  
7.7. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
7.7.1. Blood Sample Collection  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained on Cycle 1, Day 8 at predose, 1  to 2 hours postdose, 
and 4 to 12 hours postdose (3 samples total; Table 6 ).  The exact date and time of the PK blood 
draws will be recorded in the eCRF along with the date and time of the last dose of study drug preceding the blood draw and the time of the most recent meal.  Instructions for sample 
preparation and shipping to the central laboratory  will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
The subject will re ceive a reminder card in advance of the study visit, providing instruction to 
hold the dose of study drug on the day of the visit, a place to record the time of the previous dose 
of study drug, and a place to record the time of the most recent meal or snack consumed. 
On Cycle 1 Day 8, i t is important to note that the subject must refrain from eating 8 hours prior 
to arriving at the site.   The initial predose sample should be drawn approximately 1 hour before 
study drug administration.  Subjects then need to fast for 1 additional hour after taking study 
medication.  Once the subject takes the study drug, any subsequent timed samples will be taken.

CONFIDENTIAL  8. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1. Definitions  
For the purposes of this Protocol, an adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, 
that occurs after a subject provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed consent constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, 
are considered clinically meaningful, require therapy (eg, hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion), or require changes in the study drug(s). 
8.1.2. Reporting  
Adverse events  that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events form  of the e CRF.  Conditions that were already present at the time of infor med consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History form in  the eCRF.  Monitoring for the occurrence of 
new AEs should be continued for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug.   Adverse 
events ( including lab oratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described usin g a 
diagnosis whenever possible rather than  by individual underlying signs and symptoms.  When a 
clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE . 
The term "disease progression " should be recorded as an AE/SAE only if there are no other 
identifiable AEs /SAEs  associat ed with the disease progression at the time of reporting.  For 
events associated with disease progression , the relevant signs and symptoms should be reported 
using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms.  

Incyte Corporation  Page 51 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a 
separate AE.  If the events resulting from disease progression meet the criteria for an SAE (eg, 
resulted in hospitalization, a life -threatening event, or death ), the specific event(s) should be  
reported as an SAE(s) as described in Section  8.3.2.  In both cases (ie, AEs or SAEs related to 
disease progression), it should be indicated that each event  (reported as a diagnosis or as signs 
and symptoms) is  related to disease progression  on the Adverse Events form of the eCRF. 
The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v 4.03 Grades 1 through 4.  T he CTCAE 
v4.03 severity of Grade 5 will not be used; AEs resulting in death  will be gra ded accordingly 
using Grades 1 through 4 and have the outcome noted as fatal.   If an event is not classified by 
CTCAE, the severity  of the AE will be graded according to the scale below to estimate the grade 
of severity:  
Grade  1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate activities of daily living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medical ly significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of 
daily living . 
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Note that a grading scale for hyperphosphatemia (elevated serum phosphate) is not included in  
CTCAE v 4.03.  Grading should be applied using the table above (" investigations -other, specify" 
category in CTCAE v 4.03).  Hyperphosphatemia should be graded based on clinical severity 
(eg, sympt oms) and medical intervention measures taken (eg , phosphate binders) and not on 
phosphate levels. 
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by nondirective questioning of the subject during the 
screening process after signing the ICF and at each visit during the study.  A dverse events may 
also be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during the screening process or 
between visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.  To the 
extent  possible, each AE  should be evaluated to determine: 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to  4). 
• Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study treatment:  suspected (yes) or not suspected (no). 
• The s tart and end dates, unless unresolved at final follo w-up. 
• The action taken with re gard to study drug . 
• The event o utcome ( eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, 
recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
• The s erious ness, as per serious adverse event (SAE ) definition  provided in 
Section  8.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting requirements  (see Section  8.3.2). 
Incyte Corporation  Page 52 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or 
nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on A dverse Event form and the treatment should 
be specified on  the Prior/ Concomitant M edications  or Procedures and Non- Drug T herapy form 
in the eCRF . 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it ha s resolved  or until it is judged to be 
permanent;  assessment should be made at  each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relation ship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat the event , and the outcome. 
When the severity  of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits ), each 
change in severity  will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves.  For example, 
2 separate AEs will be reported if a subject has Grade 1 diarrhea, meeting the definition of an 
AE, that lasts for 3  days before  worsening to a Grade 3 severity.  The Grade 1 event will be 
reported as an AE with a start date equal to th e day the event met the Grade 1 AE  definition and 
a stop date equal to the day that the event increased in severity  from Grade  1 to Grade 3.  The 
Grade 3 event will also be reported as an AE, with the start date equal to the day the event 
changed in intens ity from Grade  1 to Grade 3 and a stop date equal to  the day that the event 
either changed severity  again or resolved. 
8.2. Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE in their own right (considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy , or require changes 
in study drug ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event form in  the eCRF.  Whenever possible, a 
diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, " anemia" instead of " low hem oglobin" ).  
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have 
returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an abnormal 
laboratory te st result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not 
necessary to separately record the laboratory  test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE  should not be reported as AEs .  
A Grade 3 or 4 (severe) AE does not autom atically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition  
of serious, as defined in  Section  8.3.1.  A dose modification  for the lab oratory  abnormality may 
be required (see  Section  5.4) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test  
abnormality as an SAE . 
8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Definitions  
An SAE is defined as an event that meets at least 1 of the following criteria: 
• Is fatal or life -threatening . 
• Requires  inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is a result of: 
− A routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with 
any deterioration in condition.   
Incyte Corporation  Page 53 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  − An elective surgery or preplanned treatment for a pre- existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the 
ICF. 
− A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not resulting in hospital admission. 
− Any social reasons and respite care, in the absence of any deterioration in the 
subject 's general condition. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability , incapacity , or a substantial disruption of 
a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions . 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is considered to be an important medical event  or a medically significant event that 
may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospitalization but 
may be considered serious  when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the event 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
1 of the outcomes listed above. 
8.3.2. Reporting  
Every SAE, regardless of suspected causality (eg, relatio nship to study drug(s) or study 
procedure or disease progression), occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through the last 
study visit (or 30 days after the last dose of study drug, whichever is later) must be reported to 
the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours  of learning of its occurrence, unless otherwise 
specified by the Protocol.  Any SAEs occurring more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug should be reported to the sponsor or its designee only if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug. 
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Adverse Event form  of the eCRF .  
The i nvestigator must assess and record the causal relationship of each SAE to the study 
treatment .   
The investigator must also complete the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form, in English, 
and send the completed and signed form to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of becoming aware of the SAE.  The investigator must provide a causality assessment, that is, assess whether 
there is at least a reasonable possibility that the SAE is related to the study treatment:  suspected  
(yes) or not suspected (no).  Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form. 
The contact information of the sponsor' s study- specific representatives  is listed in the 
investigator manual provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the 
confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site.  
Investigational site personnel must report any new inform ation regarding the SAE within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the information in the same manner that the initial SAE Report 
Form was sent.  Follow-up information is recorded on an amended or new SAE Report Form, 
with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original 
report.  The follow-up report should include information that was not provided on the previous 
Incyte Corporation  Page 54 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  SAE Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment 
provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose reduced, interrupted, or 
discontinued), or subject disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation).  Each recurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow-up to that event, regardless of when it occurs. 
If the SAE is not documented in the IB for the study drug  (new occurrence) and is thought to be 
related to the sponsor' s study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently requir e further 
information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities .  The sponsor or its designee 
may need to issue an  Investigator Notification (IN)  to inform all investigators involved in any 
study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and 
relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC , or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
8.4. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
Not applicable. 
8.5. Pregnanc y 
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or method.  When a pregnancy has been confirmed in a subject during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug, 
the following procedures should be follow ed in order to ensure subject safety: 
• The s tudy drug must be discontinued immediately  (female subjects only ; see 
Section  5.4.2 for the maximum permitted dura tion of study drug interruption). 
• The i nvestigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy  form 
to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours  of learning of t he pregnancy. 
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety 
evaluation.  Follow-up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by following 
until the first well- baby visit.  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy f orm 
and reported by the investigator to the sponsor or its designee.  Pregnancy follow-up information 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal relationship to the sponsor' s study drug to  any pregnancy outcome , as well as  follow-up to the 
first well-baby visit or the duration specified in local regulations , whichever is later .  Refer to the 
Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form.  
Any SAE occurring  during pregnancy must be re corded  on the SAE report form and 
submitted to the sponsor or designee.  
Incyte Corporation  Page 55 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  8.6. Warnings and Precautions  
Special warnings or precautions for the study drug, derived from safety information collected by  
the sponsor or its designee , are presented in the IB.  Ad ditional safety  information collected 
between IB updates will be communicated in the form of Investigator Notifications  (INs) .  Any 
important new safety information should be discussed with the subject during the study, as 
necessary.  If new significant ri sks are identified, they will be added to the ICF. 
8.7. Data Monitoring Committee  
Not applicable.  
8.8. Product Complaints  
The sponsor collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and facilitate 
process and product improvements. 
All product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by the sponsor 
or its designee will be reported  to the sponsor.  All product complaints associa ted with other 
study material will be reported directly to the respective manufacturer.  
The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for reporting a complete description of the 
product complaint via email or other written communication to the sponsor contact  or respective 
manufacturer as noted in the packaging information.  Any AE associated with a product 
complaint should be reported as described in Section  8.1.2 of this Protocol. 
If the i nvestigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the 
product complaint communication  with the product. 
9. STATISTICS  
9.1. Study Population s 
The efficacy evaluable population includes all subjects who have a known FGF/FGFR alteration from the central genomics laboratory and received at least 1 dose of study drug , and all subjects 
in the US who have a negative FGF/FGFR alteration from the central genomics laboratory and 
received at least 1  dose of study drug. 
The per protocol (PP) population includes all efficacy  subjects who were sufficiently compliant 
with the Protocol. 
The safety population includes all subjects who received  at least 1 dose of study drug. 
9.2. Selection of Sample Size  
Approximately 100 subjects with documentation of FGFR2 translocation from the central genomics laboratory are planned for the final analysis  of the primary endpoint of ORR.  With the 
assumed rates of 33% for the intervention, a sample size of approximately 100 subjects would 
provide > 95% probability to have a 95% c onfidence interval with lower limit of >  15% 
Incyte Corporation  Page 56 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  assuming 10% lost to follow-up.  Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled in Cohorts B and C (US 
only), respectively, which will provide > 80% chance of observing at least 4 responders in each 
cohort if the underlying ORR is 30%. 
9.3. Level of Significance  
The level of significance for the primary endpoint is 1-sided 5%. 
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
Subjects will be summarized by cohorts , and cohort determination will be based on FGF/FGFR 
status from the central genomics laboratory. 
9.4.1. Efficacy Analyses 
9.4.1.1. Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The primary endpoint of the study is ORR in subjects with FGFR2 translocations  based on the 
central genomics laboratory results , defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a CR or a 
PR based on RECIST v 1.1 as assessed by an independent centralized radiological review 
committee .  This analysis will be based on efficacy evaluation population.  Subjects who do not 
have sufficient baseline or on -study response assessment information to be adequately assessed  
for response status will be included in the denominators in the calculation of ORR .  The 95% CI 
for the ORR will be estimated using the Clopper -Pearson method. 
The ORR will also be analyzed based on per  protocol population as sensitivity analysis. 
9.4.1.2. Seconda ry Efficacy Analyses 
Secondary efficacy analysis will be conducted for the efficacy evaluable population.  
Objective response rate in subjects with FGF/FGFR alterations other than FGFR2 translocations, 
in subjects negative for FGF/FGFR alteration  and in al l subjects with FGF/FGFR alterations  will 
be analyzed in the same fashion as the primary analysis.  
For objective responders, DOR is defined as the time from the date that a subject first achieves  
CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1 until the date of first documented disease progression based on 
RECIST v1.1 or death.  Subjects who are alive without progression before analysis cut- off date 
will be censored.  Censoring of DOR will follow the same algorithm as the censoring of PFS.  
Duration of response data will be analyzed by the Kaplan -Meier method for all cohorts. 
Disease control rate, defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved CR, PR, or SD per RECIST v1.1 will be analyzed in the same fashion as the primary analysis. 
Progression-free survival is defined a s the time  from the first day of taking study dose to the 
earlier of death or disease progression by RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the central radiographic review committee.  Subjects who are alive without progression before analysis cut- off date will 
be cens ored.  Censoring for PFS will follow FDA guidance.  Progression -free survival  data will 
be analyzed by the Kaplan -Meier method  for all cohorts . 
Incyte Corporation  Page 57 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  Overall survival is defined as the number of days from the first day taking study drug to death 
due to any cause.  Subjects without death observed at the time of the analysis will be censored at 
last date known to be alive.  Overall survival will be analyzed by the Kaplan -Meier  method. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
9.4.2. Safety Analyses 
9.4.2.1. Adverse Events  
A TEAE is any  AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre- existing event after 
first dose of study drug.  Analysis of AEs will be limited to TEAEs, but data listings will include all AEs regardless of their timing to study drug administration.  Adverse events will be tabulated 
by the MedDRA preferred term and system organ class.  Severity of AEs will be based on the 
National Cancer Institute ( NCI) CTCAE v4.03 using Grades 1 through 4 ( NCI 2010 ). 
The subset of AEs considered by the investigator to have a relationship to study drug will be considered to be treatment- related AEs.  If the investigator does not specify  the relationship of 
the AE to study drug, the AE will be considered treatment- related.  The incidence of AEs and 
treatment -related AEs will be tabulated.  
Subjects taking INCB054828 may develop HP , which is a known effect of selective FGFR 
inhibitors.  The number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 event of HP will be tabulated.  
9.4.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Laboratory test values outside the normal range will be assessed for severity based on the normal ranges for the clinical reference laboratory.  The incidence of abnormal laboratory values and 
shift tables relative  to baseline will be tabulated.  
Laboratory data will be classified into Grades 1 through 4 using CTCAE v4.03.  The following 
summaries will be produced for the laboratory data:  
• Number and percentage of subjects with worst postbaseline CTC AE grade (regardless 
of baseline value).  Each subject will be counted only for the worst grade observed postbaseline. 
• Shift tables from  baseline to the worst postbaseline value using CTC AE grade.  
• For laboratory parameters where CTC AE grades are not defined, shift tables to the 
worst postbaseline value using the low/normal/hig h classifications based on

CONFIDENTIAL  9.4.2.3. Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics and mean change from baseline will  be determined for vital signs (blood 
pressure, pulse , respiratory rate, and body temperature) at each assessment time.  Vital sign  
results will be reviewed for clinically notable abnormalities (see Table 9), and subjects exhibiting 
clinically notable vital sign abnormalities will be listed.  A value will be considered an "alert" 
value if it is  outside the established range and shows a > 25% change from baseline.  
Table 9: Criteria for Clinically Notable Vital Sign Abnormalities  
Parameter High Threshold  Low Threshold  
Systolic blood pressure  > 155 mmHg  < 85 mmHg

QTcF = Fridericia correction.  
9.4.3. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The data will be analyzed by standard population PK methods using appropriate software (eg, NONMEM).  An attempt will be made to evaluate the effect of demographic characteristics and 
baseline characteristics (eg, age, weight, sex, race, renal function, FGF/FGFR alteration status) on the population PK profile.  Additionally, exposure- response analyses for key efficacy and 
safety parameters will also be considered if there is sufficient data available  (Appendix C ). 
9.5. Analyses for the Data Monitoring Committee  
Not applicable. 
9.6. Futility  Analysis 
For Cohort A (FGFR2 translocation), futility analysis will be performed when approximately 
25 subjects are enr olled into the cohort and have at least 1 tumor assessment or have permanently 
discontinued study treatment.  Cohort A can be stopped for futility if 2 or less responders are

60 subject cohort, as initially planned before  Amendment 5.  This rule is just a guidance and 
nonbinding. 
Cohorts B (other FGF/FGFR alterations) and C (US only; negative for FGF/FGFR alterations) 
can be stopped if 1 or less responders are observed w ithin the first 10 subjects who have at least 
2 cycles of data.   This is just a guidance and nonbinding. 
10. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
PROCEDURES  
10.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
This study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that originate in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and conducted in adherence to the study Protocol; GCPs as defined in 
Title  21 of the US CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, and 312; ICH E6 GCP consolidated guidelines; and 
local regulatory requirements  as applicable to t he study location s. 
The investigator will be responsible for: 
• Permitting  study- related monitoring , sponsor audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory 
inspections by providing direct access to source data and other relevant clinical study 
documents. 
− Monitoring:  Qualified representatives of the sponsor or its  designee, study 
monitors, will monitor the study according to a predetermined plan.   The 
investigator must allow the study monitors to review any study materials and 
subject records  at each monitoring visit. 
− Auditing:  Qualified representatives of the sponsor or its designee may audit the 
clinical study site and study data to evaluate compliance with the Protocol, 
applicable local clinical study regulations, and overall study conduct.  The investigator must allow the auditors to review original source records and study 
documentation for all subjects. 
− Regulatory inspection:  Regulatory authorities may conduct an inspection of the 
study and the site at any time during the development of an investigational product.  The investigator and staff are expected to cooperate with the inspectors 
and allow access to all source documents supporting the eCRFs and other 
study-related documents.  The investigator must immediately notify the sponsor when contacted by any regulatory authority for the purposes of conducting an inspection. 
• Obtaining informed consent and ensuring that the study subjects' questions have been 
answered and the subjects fully understand study procedures:  
− Informed consent must be obtained before  any stu dy-related procedures are 
conducted, unless otherwise specified by the Protocol. 
Incyte Corporation  Page 60 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  − Informed consent must be obtained using the IRB/IEC -approved version in a 
language that is native and understandable to the subject.  A template will be 
provided by the sponsor or its designee.  The sponsor or its designee must review 
and acknowledge the site -specific changes to the ICF template .  The ICF must 
include a statement that the sponsor or its designee and regulatory authorities have 
direct access to subject records.  
• Obtaining approval from the IRB/IEC before the start  of the study and for any 
changes to the clinical study Protocol, important Protocol deviations, routine updates, 
and safety information in accordance with institutional requirements and local law. 
− The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the safety reports provided by the 
sponsor are reviewed and processed in accordance with regulatory requirements 
and with the policies and procedures established by the IRB /IEC . 
• Adhering to the Protocol as descri bed in this document and agree ing that changes to 
the Protocol procedures , with the exception of medical emergencies, must be 
discussed and approved, first, by the sponsor or its designee and, second , by the 
IRB/IEC.  Each investigator is responsible for enrolling subjects who have met the 
specified eligibility  criteria . 
• Retain ing records in accordance with all local, national, and regulatory laws, but for a 
minimum period of at least 2  years after the last marketing application approval in an 
ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in 
an ICH region, or if not approved, 2 years after the termination of the test article for 
investigation to ensure the availability of study documentation should it become 
necessary for t he sponsor or a regulatory authority to review. 
− The investigator must not destroy any records associated with the study without receiving approval from the sponsor.  The investigator must notify the sponsor or 
its designee in the event of accidental loss o r destruction of any study records.  If 
the investigator leaves the institution where the study was conducted, the sponsor or its designee must be contacted to arrange alternative record storage options. 
− All eCRF data entered by the site (including audit t rail), as well as computer 
hardware and software (for accessing the data), will be maintained or made 
available at the site in compliance with applicable record retention regulations.  
The sponsor will retain the original e CRF data and audit trail.  
10.2. Account ability, Handling, and Disposal of Study Drug  
The investigator is responsible for drug accountability at the study site; however, some of the 
drug accountability duties may be assigned to an appropriate pharmacist or other designee.  
Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by 
the study monitor and are open to inspection at any time by any applicable regulatory authorities.  The investigator or designee must maintain records that document: 
• Delivery of stud y drug to the study site.  
• Inventory of study drug at the site. 
Incyte Corporation  Page 61 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  • Subject use of the study drug including pill or unit counts from each supply 
dispensed. 
• Return of study drug to the investigator or designee by subjects. 
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol.  The investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the specified 
study drug.  These records should include dates, quantities, and any available batch or serial numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product and study subjects. 
Completed accountability records will be archived by the site.  The investigator or designee will 
be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug until verified by  the study monitor (unless otherwise agreed to by the sponsor).  At the 
conclusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining study drug back to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional standard operating procedures.  If local procedures mandate on-site destruction of investigational supply, 
the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study 
monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and accuracy of 
accountability by the investigative site.   At sites where the study drug is destroyed before 
monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site SOP.  
10.3. Data Management  
Data management will be performed in a validated database via an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.  All data entry, verification, and validation will be performed in accordance with 
the current standard operating procedures of the Data Management Department  at the sponsor or 
its designee .  The database will be authorized for lock once all defined procedures are completed. 
The investigator will be provided with access to an EDC system so that an eCRF can be completed for each subject .  Entries made in the eCRF must be verifiable against source 
documents; if updates to the database are not possible, any discrepancies should be explained 
and documented.  The investigator will be responsible for reviewing all data and eCRF entries, 
and w ill sign and date the designated forms in each subject 's eCRF, verifying that the 
information is true and correct.  The investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all 
query responses. 
Protocol deviations will be identified and recorded in t he Protocol Deviation form  of the eCRF.  
The study monitor will reference the Monitoring Plan in order to ensure that each issue identified 
is appropriately documented, reported, and resolved in a timely manner in accordance with the plan's requirements.  
10.4. Data Privacy and Confidentiality of Study Records  
The investigator and the sponsor or its designee must adhere to applicable data privacy laws and regulations.  The investigator and the sponsor or its designee are responsible for ensuring that sensitive inf ormation is handled in accordance with local requirements (eg, HIPAA).  
Appropriate consent and authorizations for use and disclosure and/or transfer (if applicable) of protected information must be obtained. 
Incyte Corporation  Page 62 of 83 
Protocol INCB 54828- 202 Am 7 Version 7  02 APR  2020  
CONFIDENTIAL  Subject names will not be supplied to the sponsor or its designee, if applicable.  Only the subject 
number and subject' s initials (subject 's initials will only be recorded if allowable by local 
regulations) will be recorded in the e CRF , where permitted; if the subject 's name appears on any 
other document (eg, laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to the sponsor or its designee.  Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in 
accordance with local data protection laws.  The subjects will be informed that representatives of the sponsor or its designee, IRB or IEC, or regulatory authorities may inspect their medical 
records to verify the information collected, and that all personal information made available for 
inspection will be handled in strictest c onfidence and in accordance with local data prot ection 
laws.  
10.5. Financial Disclosure  
Before study initiation, all clinical investigators participating in clinical studies subject to FDA Regulation Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 54 – Financial  Disclosure by 
Clinical Investigators (ie, "covered studies ") are required to submit a completed Clinical 
Investigator Financial Disclosure form that sufficiently details any financial interests and 
arrangements that apply.  For the purpose of this regulation, " clinical investigator " is defined as 
any investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of 
research subjects, including the spouse and each dependent child of the clinical investigator or subinvestigator .  The se requirements apply to both US and foreign clinical investigators 
conducting covered clinical studies. 
Any new clinical investigators added to the covered clinical study during its conduct must also 
submit a completed Investigator Financial Disclosure Fo rm.  During a covered clinical study, 
any changes to the financial information previously reported by a clinical investigator must be 
reported to the sponsor or its designee.  At the conclusion of the covered clinical study, the 
clinical investigators will be reminded of their obligations.  In the event that the clinical investigator  is not reminded, the y nevertheless  will remain obligated  to report to the sponsor or 
its designee any changes to the financial information previously reported, as well as any change s 
in their financial information for a period of 1 year after completion of the covered clinical study. 
10.6. Publication Policy  
By signing the study Protocol, the i nvestigator and his or her institution agree that the results of 
the study may be used by the sponsor, Incyte Corporation (Incyte), for the purposes of national 
and international registration, publication, and information for medical and pharmaceutical professionals.  Study results will be published in accordance with applicable local and nationa l 
regulations.  If necessary, the authorities will be notified of the investigator's name, address, 
qualifications, and extent of involvement.  The terms regarding the publication of study results

CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX A. INFORMATION REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF 
CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD S 
For Subjects Participating in the Study:  
The following methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used 
consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods.  
Such methods include: 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− intravaginal 
− transdermal  
• Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation1 
− oral 
− injectable  
− implantable2 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)2 
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system ( IUS)2 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion2 
• Vasectomised  partner2,3 
• Sexual abstinence4 
 
1  Hormonal  contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, which may reduce the efficacy of the 
contraception method. 
2  Contrac eption  methods that in the context of this guidance are  considered to have low user dependency.  
3  Vasectomised  partner is a highly effective method provided of avoiding pregnancy  that partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the WOCBP trial participant and t hat the vasectomised  partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgical success.  
4  In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the enti re period of risk associated with the study treatments.  The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

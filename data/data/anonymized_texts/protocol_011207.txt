Brief Summary of Research (250 -400 words):  
Gulf War Illness has been a recognized consequence of our fighting the first Gulf War since spring of 
1991 and still no treatments specifically for it exist.  Since then, pharmaceutical treatments have 
become available for one complaint of Gulf veterans with GWI – namely widespread pain and achiness.  
However, these treatments have three major drawbacks – they don’t work on all patients; their effect often does not last more than a few months; and the side effects they produce are often so bad as to 
preclude their use.  We present here a plan to test a new treatment to improve the widespread pain 
reported by many Gulf veterans – a hand -held device that stimulates the vagus nerve in the neck.  
 
Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is FDA approved for treatment -resistant epilepsy and depression.  We 
became interested in using VNS as a modality to treat widespread pain  for two reasons:  first, patients 
receiving VNS reported having less pain and second, drugs to treat epilepsy and depression are in the 
same class as newly approved drugs to treat the widespread pain characteristic of fibromyalgia, a diagnosis which many Gulf vets also have.  We did a safety and tolerability study in 14 women with fibromyalgia who tolerated surgical implantation and activation of the device as well as patients with the other FDA -approved indications for its use. Strikingly, many of the wom en got so much better that 
they no longer fulfilled criteria for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. To determine that this effect was specific to VNS and was not a non-  specific “placebo” type of response, a follow -up study comparing 
the actual device to one d esigned not to stimulate the vagus nerve is necessary. 
 
We propose doing such a study on Gulf veterans with GWI, characterized by a problem with widespread pain.  Besides their pain, we will also assess the effect of VNS in alleviating migraine headache, another complaint of Gulf veterans, common in the presence of widespread pain.  Importantly, we are partnering with a company that has made a hand -held device that allows for 
stimulation of the vagus nerve without the need for surgery; it works by the patie nt putting it on the 
skin overlying the vagus nerve in their neck and then turning it on for 120 second periods three times a day.  The device is programmed to deliver only 6 bouts of stimulation per day – one to each side of the neck three times a day; it is then inactive until the next day.  The fact that this device can be used without surgery and is non- invasive makes it extremely practical for use.

After collecting pre -treatment measurement of pain severity and headache severity, veterans will 
receive either the actual active VNS device or an inactive device, which does not stimulate the nerve.  
Veterans will use their device for ten weeks – providing similar information periodically over this period by responding to questions about the severity of their pain and headaches, They will then return to the Center for the final phase of the study where all veterans will receive active devices.  Ten weeks later, they will return to the Center to provide information to allow the investigators to gain further knowledge as to the effectiveness of actual VNS in relieving pain – both throughout the body and in the head.  
 
1) Objectives  
Research Question:  The major research question is to determine if VNS reduces the widespread pain of GWI while sham VNS does not.  Next, for those veterans with comorbid migraine, the question is to determine if number and severity of migraine headaches are lessened by VNS in contrast to sham VNS.  
Specific Aims : (1) To conduct a small randomized clinical trial (n ≤ 44) to e valuate the efficacy of 
self-administered, non -invasive, active nVNS in veterans with GWI as compared to sham treatment. 
(2) To provide clinical proof -of-principle data and support future development of broader efficacy 
studies for GWI  
 
2) Background  
Approxim ately 25% of veterans who were deployed to the Persian Gulf for the 1990- 1991 conflict 
returned home with the new onset of medical complaints without any obvious medical cause.  The major symptoms comprising this multi- symptom illness were widespread pain, fatigue and difficulty with 
attention and concentration.  This syndrome is now known as Gulf War Illness ( GWI ).  Widespread pain, 
one of the major symptoms comprising GWI, has been recently reported to occur in approximately 56% 
of Gulf veterans with GWI
17; as we will indicate later, we have found an even  higher rate in our own 
sample.  In this proposal, we will present a plan for a double -blind, sham -controlled trial of transcutaneous 
vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) to treat this symptom and, by doing so, to improve the general health of 
Gulf veterans with GWI.  
More than 20 years have passed since this conflict and there is still no treatment for GWI besides 
symptomatic treatment.  Fortunately , drugs do exist to treat the complaint of widespread pain.  These 
drugs come from two classes – anti -epileptic drugs  or serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.  
However there are two major problems with the use of these drugs. First , their side effect profile, 
including more fatigue, more cognitive problems plus weight gain, makes veterans loathe to use them and, second, their efficacy is often limited both in the percentage of patients helped and in the duration of effect
19.  Clearly other modalities of treatment are necessary.   
One such modality is vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).  VNS is a treatment that is FDA approved for two treatment resistant disease proces ses – epilepsy and major depressive disorder.  Because pharmaceutical

treatments for these two disorders also treat widespread pain (WSP), we hypothesized that VNS might 
also impact the same pathophysiological processes and relieve WSP.  That hypothesis wa s initially 
supported by several papers showing a reduction in pain in patients receiving VNS for treatment of their 
seizures11, 15 or for their depression3.  These data led us to propose a study to determine if VNS would 
reduce pain and improve the health of  patients with treatment- resistant fibromyalgia (FM), a syndrome of 
WSP with tenderness on palpation25.  That study, allowing us to assess the safety and tolerability of VNS 
in FM, was funded by an NIH grant , and is now completed with  results published in the medical 
literature13.   
In our study of VNS treatm ent of FM, w e used three outcome measures: (1) a 30% improvement from 
baseline ‘usual pain ratings in the last week’ (at least 5 on a 0 to 10 pain intensity scale was required on intake to participate); (2) Patient Global Impression of Change score rated a s markedly or moderately 
improved (highest two self ratings on a 7 point scale); and (3) an improvement of at least 6 points (0.6 
SD) on the Physical Function subscale of the SF -36
24.  Most drug trials in FM use  only pain reduction as 
the major outcome variable.  For this  study, we required patients to fulfill all three criteria – a very 
conservative outcome measure.   
Adverse events. Fourteen FM patients, all non- veteran women, signed their informed consent to 
participate in the trial.  Following recovery from the surgery necessary to implant the device, patients received stimulation for 30 sec every 5 min around the clock at the highest tolerable current.  T here were 
two unanticipated adverse reactions.  The first was the complaint of stimulus -bound ele ctric-like 
sensations across one patient’s  chest and into her left arm that  was reduced by lowering VNS intensity; 
this side effect of stimulation was tolerable but continued throughout the entire 12 months of the trial.  The second was the complaint of such severe dyspepsia as to require device deactivation; the dyspepsia continued despite the device’s being off and so it was not thought to be device -related.  Af ter 3 months of 
stimulation, one patient requested explan ation because she thought the VNS ha d exacerbated her existing 
headache condition ( this patient actually reported improvement in her FM ).  Another patient was dropped 
due to noncompliance with scheduled visits.  Analysis was therefore limited to 12 evaluable patients.  
Consistent  with the already FDA approved indications of implanted VNS, the most common device and 
stimulation related adverse event s included voice alteration ranging from mild (n=5) to moderate (n=4), 
neck pain ranging in severity from mild (n=1) to moderate (n=3) to severe (n=3), dyspnea ranging from 
mild (n=3) to moderate (n=4), nausea ranging from mild (n=2) to moderate (n=3), facial pain ranging in severity from mild  (n=1) to  moderat e (n=3) to severe (n=1), and sleep difficulties/insomnia of moderate 
severity (n=4).  All of these adverse events were either self limited or decreased in severity over time.   
While rates of occurrence for voice alteration for FM patients (64%) were similar to those of patients with treatment resistant MDD (58%) and epilepsy (54%), rates of neck/facial pain  (50%), headaches  (21%), 
and dyspnea (50%) were greater in the FM sample than those with treatment resistant MDD (13 -16%, less 
than 5%, and 14- 16%, resp ectively) , but again these adverse events were either self limited or decreased 
in severity over time .  These observations in this small sample do suggest , however, that individuals with 
treatment resistant FM, a chronic pain disorder, may be more sensitive to pain related to VNS .  However, 
this increased sensitivity never  result ed in termination of stimulation.

Therapeutic outcome:  After three months of active s timulation , five (36%) of the 12 participants fulfilled 
all three  outcome measure criteria for improvement simultaneously – i.e., the criterion we had chosen for 
effective treatment.  Baseline pain, self rated on a 0 to 10 visual analog scale, averaged 8.5 (± 1.0 SD ). 
After 3 months of stimulation, average pain ratings had decreased significantly to 4.2 ( ± 2.1; z = 2.94; p < 
0.01) ; the decrease in pain was ≥ 30% for 9 patients.  Patient Global Impression of Change for 12 of the 
14 patients was given as either “markedly” or “moderately improved.”  And finally, the physical function 
component of the SF -36 at baseline averaged 27.0 ( ± 5.1)  and increased significantly to 36.4 ( ± 9.6)  after 
3 months of stimulation ( z = 2.04, p < 0.04 ); an improvement ≥  0.6 SD improvement in physical function 
occurred in 7 of the 12 patients.   
An unexpected consequence learned during the study was that efficacy was so marked that some patients no longer fulfilled both the WSP criterion and the tenderness criterion necessary for t he diagnosis of FM . 
Specifically by the end of 3 months of stimulation, 2 of the 14 patients no longer fulfilled both of the two diagnostic criteria for FM; these numbers increased to 5 patients by study end – 12 months after the start of stimulation.  When viewed in the context of the actual outcome data, these results suggest that improvement in self -reported symptoms reaches asymptote after 3 months of stimulation, but functional 
improvement continues beyond this point.  Results like these have never been reported in drug trials 
1, 2, 4 
or with brain- activating devices 5, 9, 18, 22, 23. 
Advantage and limitations of design:  The major advantage of the design in the FM study was that patients could enter the trial without having to stop their usual medical regimen.  Since the widespread pain in these non- veterans is the same as that in veterans, moving the device to the treatment of veterans 
with WSP is a natural step.  T he design in the original study had two major limitations that we plan to 
rectify here: first, practicality of use – the stimulation electrodes and battery had to be surgically 
implanted by either a vascul ar surgeon or neurosurgeon, and the implantable system was expensive – 
costing more than $30,000, including the c osts of surgery; cost and need for surgical implantation greatly 
limited the practicality of using this treatment.  S econd, the design – the study had no sham -control limb, 
and so the dramatic therapeutic effects observed could have been non -specific respo nses to being in a 
therapeutic trial – i.e., placebo responding.  Since Dr Natelson has never seen such a level of improvement either in his practice or in a recently completed double -blind placebo controlled trial of 
milnacipran in FM, he doubt s the latte r possibility.  Nevertheless, the design we will present in this 
protocol will have a sham stimulation limb , and the trial itself will also be a double -blind study design.  
We expect that an important outcome of the study will be data to indicate that the positive results of the preliminary trial
13 were directly due to vagus nerve stimulation and not due to a placebo effect.  
To get around the cost issue, we have partnered in preparing this proposal with electroCore LLC (Basking Ridge, NJ), a biomedical device company that has  developed a much less expensive hand- held, 
transcutaneous, non -invasive (nVNS) stimulator that eliminates the risks associated with surgery and can 
immediately be put to use as patients self -administer therapy. The device has  recently received FDA 
approval  for the acute treatment of pain associated with both cluster and migraine headaches.  Importantly 
a recent study identified migraine in 64% of Gulf veterans with GWI
17. A secondary goal of this study 
will be to determine if Gulf veterans with WSP who also report having migrai ne will show improvement 
in their headache condition with nVNS when compared with sham nVNS treatment.

Pathobiological mechanism s being targeted by nVNS 
In the widespread pain condition of FM, an up- regulated  nociceptive system known as central 
sensitizat ion as well as d ysregulation of descending pain- ameliorating systems ha ve been identified21.  
Thus FM patients report sensitization of pain producing stimuli rather than habituation20, have lower pain 
thresholds than controls8, and do not show the normal inhibition to a painful probe produced by applying 
a prior painful st imulus ( abnormal descending nociceptive inhibitory control )12.  VNS  appears to reverse 
these abnormalities – at least in part.  VNS activates af ferent vagal fibers, which synapse onto the nucle us 
tractus solitarius (NTS) in the brain stem.  Projections from the NTS connect to noradrenergic and 
serotonergic neural structures implicated in pain modulation16, including the locus  coeruleus and the 
nucleus raphe magnus.  These pontine and medullary structures have well established roles in descending 
inhibition of pain and have efferent fibers that travel along ventrolateral and dorsolateral funiculi to dorsal 
horn nociceptive neur ons16.  Vagus nerve innervation is also found in the periaqueductal gray, 
hypothalamus, and thalamus, from where it progresses to the insula, as well as the cingulate, orbitofrontal and prefrontal cortices – i.e., brain regions known to be involved in pain modulation. Importantly, these 
same structures are activated by VNS, suggesting that VNS may have a therapeutic role in pain relief via  
descending inhibition of spinal nociceptive signals

Recruitment of veterans with GWI will be done at the East Orange VA Medical Center’s  (EOVAMC’s) 
War Related Illness & Injury Study Center (WRIISC), which Dr . Natelson established in 2000.  One of 
the physicians there, Dr Anays Sotolongo, will supervise recruitment efforts and will supervise a full 
time research assistant at the EOVAMC WRIISC. Potential research subjects, i.e., Gulf veterans with 
GWI and widespread pain, will sign their VA -based informed consent to allow WRIISC personnel to 
share PHI with Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai( ISMMS ) research personnel.  Thus, the East 
Orange VA’s IRB will review this study and approve the local IRB before this  study moves forward. 
Suitable veterans will then come to the Annenberg Building at ISMMS where they will sign their 
informed consent to participate in the actual sham -controlled, blinded treatment trial.  
  
4) Resources Available to Conduct the Human Researc h 
The call for proposals  leading to the current study required individual investigators  to partner with 
industry. The preliminary data  on which the current proposal builds  had been collected via an NIH 
grant using a surgically implanted VNS device.  The company making this implanted device had no interest in using it in pain syndromes, and the cost of the device as well as the costs for implanting it made it impractical for large scale use.  In the meantime, it came to the atte ntion of Dr Natelson , the 
PI, that electroCore (eC) Ltd.  was manufacturing and testing a rechargeable, externally delivered, 
transcutaneous device for VNS.  As published preliminary clinical efficacy data using this device were encouraging and the use of t he device less cumbersome and more economical, he approached eC to 
partner with him in this study to fulfill the requirements of the Department of Defense (DoD) contract for partnership with industry.  That partnership led first to a LOI which was approved and then the full proposal which was funded at the end of the last government fiscal year. Thus the work will be done at ISMMS  in collaboration with eC. 
Recruitment goals and determination of sample size: Sample size was determined based on Lange et 
al.’s published paper on implanted VNS in non- veterans [i.e., 12 evaluable patients]  on which Dr. 
Natelson was the senior author .  In these participants mean pain severity decreased by 4.2 units on a 
scale from 0 to 10 over a 3- month period of active stimulatio n, a large effect (Cohen’s d = 1.92).  
Based on this  result , we tested the power to determine a large effect of VNS condition (Cohen’s f2 = 
.35) on post -intervention pain- severity, controlling for pre -intervention pain severity.  The power 
analysis was con ducted with G*Power 39, specifying a standard Type I error ( α = .05) and desired 
power of .80.  Results indicate that a total sample of 26 would be sufficient.  Given a sample of 40, the 
proposed research should be amply powered to detect a condition difference in pain severity, even 
allowing for attrition.  Therefore, we will target enrollme nt to obtain data from 40 evaluable subje cts.  
We are requesting IRB permission to screen as many as 100 patients to get to the desired sample size.  Since our associates at the EOVAMC’s WRIISC are already involved in other GWI studies, we expect no proble m in attaining this target.  
Personnel resources and qualifications:  As the maximal amount of funding appropriated for this study 
by DoD would have been insufficient to do the proposed trial , the CEO of eC has agreed to support the 
study by providing personnel for instruction of veterans on use of the device, data management, and for regulatory matters.  Therefore, Arde Montasser, the eC person in charge of data management will

assist in setting up appropriate data capture methods .  Gudrun La nge, a Pain and Fatigue Study team 
member s, will act as the person training veterans on the use of the VNS  device ; she will be blinded as 
to whether the device is actual or sham .  The company will provide the devices at no charge.  
Besides Dr Natelson and t he study coordinator, funds were requested for part of the time of Michelle 
Blate, APN, the Pain and Fatigue Study Center’s research nurse -practitioner. She has previously 
worked with Dr Natelson on his milnacipran trial and on his several NIH grants. The final member  of 
the team will be Dr Aaron Stegner , a researcher at University of Wisconsin  who has his own 
independent practice for statistical analysis and  who has worked with Dr Natelson in the past on 
statistical analysis of data  collected at MSBI .    In addition, the s tudy c oordinator and Dr Gudrun 
Lange, an unpaid collaborator will work on re gulatory issues , consult with Drs Natelson and VA 
research personnel  on the progress of the study and meet with study staff on a quarterly basis to get 
feedback f rom the Data Monitor, Mr Mulligan. Dr Cynthia Har den will serve as Independent Safety 
Monitor and Jonathan Mulligan will serve as Independent Study/Regulatory Monitor. 
Potential research subjects will be identified at the East Orange VA Medical Center’s War 
Related Illness & Injury Study Center.  This Center is one of three national VA Centers devoted to the health concerns of the Gulf War veteran.  Dr Natelson competed for this Center when he was in the VA system and, after it was approved and funded, served as its director from 2000 to 2004.  While the Center has expanded its focus to include the medically unexplained symptoms of veterans of current conflicts, it continues its focus on Gulf War Illness and has several ongoing studies on this topic.

read the Investigational Plan and the consent which are FDA approved and will be IRB approved.  
Instruction to the patient on use of the VNS device will be done by an blinded trainer who will be trained on all aspects of device use by eC personnel.  
 
5) Study Design  
a) Recruitment Methods  
The three nation -wide WRIISC s were establish ed to study the medical complaints of veterans of the 
1990- 91 Gulf War.  Since then, the NJ WRIISC has continued to accrue names of Gulf veterans with 
an interest in participating in research.  To date, the NJ WRIISC has 583 Gulf veterans in its database with 90% having agreed to be contacted for future research.  Of these, the WRIISC has health related 
information on 103 Gulf veterans.  Of these veterans, 86 (83.5%) reported having c hronic widespread 
pain.  
Over half of these 103 veterans reported that the y also have headaches consistent with the diagnosis of 
migraine.  Only 7% of these veterans reported having migraine without having comorbid widespread pain (WSP).  Because migraine without WSP is not common in our sample population, we will focus our recruitment on Gulf veterans with GWI in whom WSP is a major symptom and will identify the subgroup that also fulfills criteria for the diagnosis of migraine headache. Thus, the study will allow us to determine whether nVNS improves WSP and whether it also improves migraine.

We will initiate recruitment by having the research study coordinator , who will be an MSBI employee 
working half time at MSBI and half time at the WRIISC,  contact the 86 Gulf veterans who have 
reported having WSP and who have consented to be contacted for potential research studies. These 86 
subjects should be a large enough recruitment group to achieve the required sample size of 40 
participants (we ar e budgeting for 44 participants to allow for drop out).  If additional subjects are 
needed for study, the research study coordinator will identify these from the remaining approximately 400 Gulf veterans w hose contact information has been collected at the WRIISC and who have agreed 
to be contacted for research .  The  coordinator will call subjects, as needed, and collect symptom 
information to determine if they may have GWI with widespread pain.  Subjects will then go to the WRIISC to learn about this study, go through the necessary screening and sign their informed consent 
to allow their PHI to be transmitted to ISMMS .  Veterans will also be given a brochure summarizing 
what they will expect during the study and a schedule of all visits, both phone and face to face.  We have developed f lyers which will be distributed to places that Gulf veterans will see  to inform them 
about the study, which includes health and veteran related online websites,  in addition to being 
distributed over a course of time to veteran emails and to mobile devices .  
General study info will also be posted on the Pain and Fatigue Study Center’s website [painandfatigue.com] for informational purposes, as well as for possible subject recruitment. The specific text that will be posted on the website is included with the study submission in a file  titled 
“Website Info.”

The VA part of the study will take up to 2 weeks. The ISMMS part of the study will consist of 
two parts – the blinded phase of the study which will be 10 weeks in duration and which will 
be followed by the open label phase of the study for an additional 10 weeks.  
Allowing for scheduling, an individual will  be in the study for up to 24 weeks. 
The study is funded for three years. We expect to complete enrollment and data collection by the third quarter of the third year. We expect to have results in the final  quarter of that year and 
will use them to prepare a proposal for funding a multi -site follow up trial to provide data to 
obtain FDA approval for use  the device in treating the widespread pain of GWI.   
 
e) Endpoints  
Primary:  To assess the effectiveness of t he active treatment compared with the sham treatment 
groups in reducing widespread pain severity occurring in the past 24 hours as measured by five  
assessments using a VAS one week prior to study enrollment and one week prior to termination of the blinded phase of the trial . Assessment of this objective will be based on differences between active vs 
sham treatment data as well as between baseline and end of treatment data.  
Secondary:   
• Change in the Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale scores  of overall symptom 
burden as completed by the subject  from study onset to end of the blinded phase of the trial .  
Assessment of this endpoint will be based on a comparison between change occurring in active -
treated versus sham -treated.  
• Change in physical function subscale of the SF -36, a questionnaire assessing health related quality 
of life  from study onset to end of the blinded phase of the trial .  Assessment of this endpoint will be 
based on a comparison between change occurring in active -treated versus sham -treated.  
• The difference between the active and sham treatment groups in change in number of migraine/headache days  in the final week of the randomized/blinded period from the week prior to 
randomization.  
 
Others:  
• Improvement in the  subject’s co existing disorder s as measured by the corresponding scales below, 
as compared with baseline measures to the blinded period:  
o Migraine:  Migraine Disability Assessment Test (M IDAS )  
o Anxiety and Depression : Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HA DS)  
• Comparison of active versus sham device data as to change in the use of pain or headache 
medications taken at th e end of the randomized/blinded period compared to baseline.

f) Procedures Involved in the Human Research  
Source data to be used in Study  
Numerical Rating Scale:   This is a zero to 10 visual analog scale asking veterans to rate the severity of 
their body- wide pain in the last 24 hrs where zero is no pain and 10 is worst pain possible. 
Kansas Criteria: T hese criteria are followed in diagnosing Gulf War Illness. This is done via the 
history which collects medical information used to diagnos e GWI through the endorsement of 
musculoskeletal pain at moderate or severe intensities.  In addition to pain, veterans must endorse 
symptoms in at least 2 more of the following problem areas:  Fatigue/ sleep; cognitive and mood; 
Gastrointestinal; respiratory; skin.   
SF-36:  This is a 36 question vehicle used to assess a patient’s health related quality of life. The 
version for veterans will be used. The physical function subscore will be one of the outc ome measures  
Patient Global Assessment of Change:  This scale consists of 7 questions, each scored with a scale ranging from +3 [very much improved] through 0 [no change] to - 3 [very much worse]  
Number of migraine days in the past week :  A migraine day is one where a patient has a headache 
lasting at least 4 hours  
Diary:   Patients will be required to complete a diary after they self administer each treatment to each 
side of his/her neck.  The diary asks the time of the treatment and th e stimulus intensity elected by the 
subject. After the final treatment for that day, the diary asks the patient if s/he has had a headache 
lasting at least 4 hours. 
Electronic Diary:   Patients will be required to complete a diary after they self administer  each 
treatment to each side of his/her neck.  The electronic diary asks the time of the treatment and the 
stimulus intensity elected by the subject.  After the final treatment for the day, the diary asks the patient if s/he has had a headache lasting at l east 4 hours.  The electronic diary mirrors the paper diary, 
except that i t is online with a secured web address .  The s ubject can access with any electronic device 
with the capability of accessing the internet.  A subject is given a unique 10 digit subjec t number to 
access the website. No other information is collected by the subject.  Upon logging in for the first time, the subject creates a password and is the only person that can log into their eDiary.  This is given as an option for subjects who prefer  to use the electronic version over the paper version. 
Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS):   This is a 7 item questionnaire  that assesses the effect 
that migraine has on a patient in the past 2.5 months. 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) : This is a 14 item questionnaire that quantifies the 
amount of anxiety and/or depressed mood a subject has had in the past week.  Measure of Certainty Questionnaire:   This is a four choice vehicle that asks a subject how certain s/he 
was that s/he was get ting the active treatment.

The Three  Phases of the Study  
Subject Identification Phase of Study  
Encounter  1: face to face visit at the WRIISC at EOVAMC  for subject identification,  consent, 
enrollment and screening. At this visit Participants will sign a co nsent document, complete several 
surveys including the PCL5 and PHQ8, a history and physical, vital signs and a 12 lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG) performed by a trained clinician. Veterans who complete screening criteria will begin the blinded phase of the s tudy if they wish  to do so. They will receive additional 
information about the risk, benefits and function and operations of the neuro- stimulator at ISMMS  
through a separate informed consent process occurring with ISMMS  Investigators at ISMMS .  No 
other study procedures with the Veterans will be done at the EOVAMC.   
   
Encounter s 2-5: 4 phone contacts done in the week after Visit 1 to assess pain in the past 24 hours. 
 
Blinded Phase of Study  
Encounter  6 – Office Visit [first time at ISMMS ]: Confirm ation of eligibility, randomization and 
device and di ary training Visit.  Subjects deemed eligible for study participation up to this point, will 
be invited to ISMMS in the Annenberg Building located at 1468 Madison Avenue, New York NY 
10029, within one we ek after Visit 5. They will sign consent for study participation. They will provide 
a fifth rating of widespread pain severity over the past 24 hours at   this encounter  on a 10- point VAS. 
The fifth pain rating will be added to the 4 VAS pain ratings done i n the week after intake at the VA. 
If the median of all 5 VAS widespread pain ratings remains at least a 5, subjects remain eligible to participate. Then medical and eligibility information obtained on Encounters #1 through 5 will be briefly reviewed, a pr egnancy test will be administered, and a medication history will be taken. If still 
deemed eligible  to continue on in the study, t hey then complete questionnaires [MIDAS, SF -36 and 
HADS]  and undergo a  brief baseline medical evaluation  consisting a physical examination including 
vital signs and a tender point examination and of asking the veteran questions to determine if s/he fulfill criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and/or irritable bowel syndrome  and for 
Gulf War Illness .  Subjects  are then randomized and trained by the blinded trainer to use the device to 
which they have been assigned [ devices are received with serial numbers covered and numbered 
sequentially so the trainer is blinded to condition] . Subjects will receive identical instruction and 
guidelines regardless of which device they receive.  To be sure the subject knows how to use the device;  s/he will be given a quiz about using the device after training.  They will also be trained on use 
of a daily diary (paper and electronic) to be completed after each of the three daily treatments.   
Subjects will be given an unique 10 digit identifier that they will used to log into the Merge IBM site, in which they will be prompted to create a username and password.  
Veterans will be  reminded [as specified in the study consent form] that in order to proceed to the open 
label phase of the study, they must administer at least 70% of all programmed stimuli as well as complete at least 70% of the diary entries ; however, because the device  needs to be sent back to the

manufacturer in order to obtain the stimulation data, resulting in a 3- 4 day delay in retrieving the data, 
we will not be able to use this criterion to advance subjects to get an actual unit  in the open label 
phase of the study.  Therefore, although we will tell subjects they have to deliver at least 70% of all 
programmed stimuli in order to get an active unit, the only criterion that will be enforced  is that they 
will have had to complete 70% of diary entries , which will be ve rified by reviewing their diary logs at 
Encounter #14. This procedure is in place so that veterans who do not perceive benefit from the treatment [i.e. those receiving sham stimulation] will continue to treat themselves per protocol; this is critical for the overall purpose of the study in order to be able to infer that it was the active treatment that produced the therapeutic effect.  If subjects did not continue stimulating themselves, we would be unable to determine whether a placebo effect existed or not.   
Encounter  7 – Phone Call:  Within 7 (±4) days after Encounter  6 (Day 0), subject will receive a phone 
call from study personnel to inquire about any negative effects of stimulation (Adverse Events, AEs) and to check if they are using the diary after ea ch stimulation.  
Encounter  8 – Phone Call:  Within 23 (±4) days after Encounter  6 (Day 0), subject will receive phone 
call from study personnel to inquire about AEs, check as to use of diary, rating of widespread pain over past 24 hours on a 10- point VAS, and potential desire to reduce medications.

Encounter  14 – Office Visit: Within 70 (±4) days after Encounter  6 (Day 0) subject will come to 
ISMMS . They will provide the 5th pain rating to arrive at the median pain rating. They will fill out 
same questionnaires the y filled out on study Encounter  6 as well as the patient global measure of 
change and the measure of certainty, and will provide information about AEs and medication changes. They will again have the same brief medical evaluation as was done on Encounter #6 to provide data as to whether they fulfill criteria for GWI, CFS, IBS, MCS or FM . They will exit the blinded part of

During this visit, the subject will be informed that although the r equirement to deliver at least 70% of 
the programmed stimulus was to be checked at Visit #14, along with completion of at least 70% of the 
diary entries, the device criterion was not actually enforced at that time because the data were not available until analyzed by the manufacturer. Subjects will be explained that this deception was in place in order to ensure that they continued to use the device as instructed, regardless of whether they thought they had a sham or active unit, allowing us to assess wheth er a positive effect of their using 
the actual device was related to its stimulating the vagus or was simply a placebo response.  They will 
also be informed that even if the device data were to indicate that they did not meet the minimum 70% use requiremen t, it would not have affected their eligibility to participate in or complete the open label

powered to detect a condition difference in pain severity, even allowing for attrition.  
Therefor e, we will target enrollment to obtain data from 40 evaluable subjects.

Statistical approach to data:   Safety data will be derived from every subject who used either sham 
or non- sham apparatus for any period of time.  Therapeutic efficacy will be evaluated using both 
intent -to-treat (for all subjects who sign consent  with those dropping out recorded as showing no 
change from baseline)  and per protocol (for subjects who completed the 10 weeks of the blinded 
phase of the trial).   
Blinded study:  Our primary  outcome variable will be post -intervention pain severity in the 
treatment versus sham condition, controlling for pain severity prior to randomization.  We will 
define success for this variable if it decreases by 30% or more over the course of the trial.  Five 
days of VAS data on pain severity will have been collected prior to randomization and during the last week of the 2.5 -month stimulation period.  For the primary analysis, these will be averaged to 
create a single pre- intervention and a single post -intervention pain severity score for each person.  
Post-intervention pain severity will be regressed on pre -intervention pain severity and intervention 
condition, using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) procedure. 
 
A second analysis will use the pre and post  measures of pain severity described above, along with 
pain severity assess ments collected a third of the way and two thirds of the way through the 10 
week blinded phase of the trial.  These four equally spaced assessments over the 10 week study period wil l form the basis of a repeated measures analysis of variance in order to plot trajectories 
of pain as a function of treatment condition.  We hypothesize a linear decrease in pain from baseline in the nVNS but not in the sham nVNS  condition.  Other variable s (e.g., MIDAS, 
physical function part of the SF -36, CES -D) will be analyzed using the same general analytic 
approach ; a simple t -test will be used to compare PGIC values between the groups at study end.  
We will define success criteria for PGIC and PF sub scale of the SF -36 as scores of 5- 7 and 0.5 SD  
improvement, respectively.  Rate of drop out between the two groups while participating in the blinded phase of the trial will be tested for significance by Fisher’s test. 
In order to test whether subjects may  have become aware of their treatment condition, we will also 
test for differences by condition in Measure of Certaint y data collected at the end of the 2.5 month 
blinded treatment phase of the study. 
 
Open label data analysis:    
In addition to the analyses reported above, the open label methodology permits  a test across all 
participants  of improvement following 2.5 months of treatment.  Regardless of condition, patients’ 
2.5-month pain scores , at the end of the  open label phase, will be compared to their baseline scores 
using a dependent samples t -test. It is possible that the sham group will show even greater 
improvement than those in the actually stimulated group had shown at the end of the blinded trial 
period.  Any such increase in improvement would probably reflect a factor related to their knowing they were receiving the effective treatment – i.e., not blinded.  Among patients originally in the active treatment condition, we can test for addi tional improvements beyond 2.5 months 
using a repeated  measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) approach.

2.  The hand held, patient controlle d, transcutaneous nVNS device presents  minimal risk  to the 
user.  T hat interpretation can be made from the fact that the device has been now used with 
hundreds of research subjects and by thousands of patients in Europe and Australia (where it has been approved for sale) with minimal s ide effects. There has never been a serious adverse 
effect attributed to its use.   
3. The specific items that will be monitored for safety include adverse events, subject’s 
compliance with the protocol, and drop outs.  
4. Since no clinical trial using nVNS has ever had to be halted, we doubt this will happen herein 
but should it happen that information will be passed onto appropriate DOD personnel monitoring the Human Studies regulatory issues related to this trial. 
5. Data accuracy and completeness:   The data collection tool for this trial will be a validated 
electronic data capture (EDC) system using eCRFs.   Subject data necessary for analysis and 
reporting will be entered into a val idated database or data system using source documentation

available at the site. The PI is to maintain all source documents as required by the protocol, 
including laboratory results, Subject Case Report Forms, supporting medical records, documentation of all study visits and telephone calls  and Informed Consents.  The source 
documents will be used at monitoring visits to verify information submitted on the Subject Case Report Forms.  
5.  Duties of the Independent Medical Monitor:  Both the study PI, Dr Natelson, and the Independent Medical Mo nitor, Dr Harden, will review any  unanticipated problems involving risk 
to subjects or others, serious adverse events and all subject deaths associated with the protocol and provide an unbiased written report of the event. Dr Natelson will transmit informa tion concerning 
such an event to the IRB with his input as to whether the event was related to the study device; this material will also be given to Dr Harden to allow her to comment on whether she concurs with the details of Dr Natelson’s report.  Reports  for events determined by either Dr Natelson  or Dr 
Harden  to be possibly or definitely related to participation and reports of events resulting in death 
will be promptly forwarded to the FDA, to the device manufacturer, electroCore, and to USAMRMC ORP HRPO. The independent Medical  Monitor has the authority to stop the research 
protocol in progress, remove individual human subjects from the  research protocol, and take 
whatever steps are necessary to protect the safety and well -being of human subje cts until the IRB 
assesses the Independent Medical  Monitor's report.  Dr Natelson and Dr Harden will meet 
biannually.  
7.  Duties of the Independent Clinical Study Monitor:  The Clinical Study Monitor will assure that 
complete, accurate and timely data are submitted,  that protocol requirements are followed, and 
that the safety and rights of subjects is being protected .    This will include on -site checking of 
the eCRF for completeness and clarity, crosschecking with source documents, and clarification 
of administrativ e matters  as follows:  
 • Ongoing compliance with the study protocol.   
• Ongoing compliance with any conditions of approval of the reviewing IRB and the IDE regulations.   
• Maintenance of complete and accurate study records  including quality control checks on 
CRFs   
• Continued acceptability of the site’s facilities.  
All monitoring tasks wi ll be carried out in such a manner as to protect patient confidentiality and 
protected health information. Data problems will be addressed  in contacts with the study staff .  Dr 
Natelson will meet with Mr Mulligan on a quarterly basis.  
  
8. If a temporary  or permanent suspension of this  study should occur, in addition to the  
 PPHS, Dr Natelson will report this immediately to DoD and to electroCore LLC.

• The subject is non- compliant with the study protocol or follow -up requirements;  
• The subject withdraws consent;  
• The Investigator decides that it is in the subject’s best interest.  
Subjects who withdraw or are withdr awn will be asked, but  not obligated, to provide a final set of data 
via questionnaires.  These subjects will not be allowed to participate in phase 3 of the study, the open 
label part.  Subjects who are randomized but withdraw consent or are withdrawn pri or to first 
treatment with the study device will be replaced.   
6. Risks  to Subjects  
The potential risks and complications are anticipated to be mild to moderate in nature, and are anticipated to resolve shortly after discontinuation of the stimulation procedure without medical intervention or clinical sequelae. The following risks and complications have been associated with other VNS devices and may potentially occur with gammaCore:  
• Muscle twitching and/or contractions to the face/head/neck including facia l droops and/or lip pull  
• Light -headedness  or dizziness  
• Headaches  
• Shortness of breath (dyspnea) /hoarseness or change in voice tone during treatment /cough  
• Irregular heart beat (arrhythmia) 
• Metallic taste  
• Gastrointestinal discomfort or nausea  
 
Risks that are also  potential anticipated adverse events  resulting from the use of the nVNS device  include, 
but are not limited to: 
 
• Application site discomfort and/or local pain in the face/head/neck area including toothaches  
• Application site irritation/redness  
• Muscle twitching and/or contractions, face/head/neck area including facial droops and/or lip pull  
• Headache/Migraine  
• Tingling, pricking or a feeling of “pins and needles” on the skin where the device is applied 
(paresthesia/dysesthesia)  
 
Should a volunteer become pregnant, she will be exited from the study as pregnancy is an exclusion.  
6) Provisions for Research Related Harm/Injury  
Dr Natelson and Ms Blate will be available to deal with any adverse event that may come from this study.  Research participants will have the phone numbers of both these investigators and can be called as needed.

If a problem arises for a veteran not living near ISMMS , the investigators will get in touch with the 
research participant’s doctor.   
If a subject is in jured or made sick from taking part in this research study, medical care will be provided. 
Generally, this care will be billed to the subject or the subject’s insurance in the ordinary manner, and the 
subject will be responsible for all treatment costs not covered by his/her insurance, including deductibles, co-payments and coinsurance.  This does not prevent the subject from seeking payment for injury related 
to malpractice  or negligence .  
 
7) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
VNS has been shown to be useful in fibromyalgia, a syndrome of widespread pain and tenderness and in several headache conditions.  Therefore we expect that use of the active unit will produce diminution of pain and reduction in frequency and severity of migraine headaches, if these also are  
present.  Because 50% of the veterans will not receive the active unit during the blinded phase of the trial but instead will receive a placebo unit which does not stimulate the vagus, we have included an open label trial during which every research parti cipant will receive and will use the 
active unit.  This procedure extends the potential benefit of participating in this study to all veteran participants.   
 
 
8) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
Subjects will only be contacted after expressing interest to participate in research and will only be 
contacted at the phone number they specify to be contacted at. All study steps will be outlined in the informed consent and subjects will have the chance to clarify or ask any questions before moving forward. Subjects are reminded that all parts of their study participation are voluntary and they may opt out or withdraw from the study at any time. 
We will be sensitive to the wishes of research participants as to their desire to control how, and with 
whom, they will interact and communicate.  To maintain privacy, we will encourage research subjects to communicate via telephone rather than email.  We will follow their direction as to how to leave phone messages on voicemail if the veteran do es not answer the phone.
  
 
9) Economic Impact on Subjects  
Veteran participants will incur no costs for participating in this study.  They will have received the diagnosis of Gulf War Illness at the NJ VA Medical Center and that diagnosis will be corroborated on intake at ISMMS .

The total payment for participating will be based on the number of visits they complete.  The 
subject will receive $ 100 per visit for a possible total of $ 300. Subjects who had previously 
consented and participated  will be contacted and offered additional compensation as well.  In 
addition, based on receipts for local travel incurred coming to ISMMS , the subject can be 
reimbursed up to $85 per vi sit for a possible total of $255.   
11) Consent Process  
Informed consent wil l be obtained on the subject’s arrival  in the Annenberg Building of the 
ISMMS located at 1468 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10029. At that time, research staff will give the potential research participant the informed consent, allow him/her to read the consent and then answer any questions they may have.  This process will be done  by either Dr Natelson, Ms 
Blate or the research coordinator.  These researchers will allot sufficient time for the veteran to be comfortable signing his/her informed consent.  The veteran will be given a copy of the signed consent.    The consent form will indicate that the device and the diary will be checked to ensure that the subject completed the minimum 70% of the use and completion requirement, however the device criterion  will not actually be used as a check for them to move onto the open label phase of the 
study due to the delay in obtaining the data from the manufacturer.  This involves some deception; however it is important to leave this criterion in place so that the subject uses the device per protocol, regardless of whether it is a sham or an actual device. This is critical to assure the integrity of the experimental design which is to use the sham stimulation to assess whether any therapeutic effect is specific to t he active device or simply a placebo.  Subjects will be debriefed 
on this discrepancy at the end of the study and given an explanation as to why the procedure was in place.

Subject will sign the consent on the usual PPHS template.

The Principal Investigator at ISMMS  is responsible for device accountability.  The Study 
Coordinator, or designee, is  responsible for maintaining the device accountability log, which will 
include tracking the receipt and return/disposition of the devices ; that information will be made 
available to the coordinator or designee by the blinded trainer , who will be giving the  device to the 
patient .  The serial numbers and disposition of the devices will be maintained off campus at 
electroCore. At monitoring  visits, the study monitors will review and reconcile the device 
shipment records, the site’s device log, the site’s devic e inventory, and allocation/return of devices 
to subjects.

1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA 
 
In this study,  we plan to treat patients  with 2 cycles  of weekly  brentuximab  vedotin  (SGN -35); 
patients  who achieve  FDG -PET/CT  normalization  will proceed  directly  to autologous  stem  
cell transplant  (ASCT)  and avoid  salvage  treatment  with ifosfamide,  carboplatin,  and 
etoposide  (ICE).  Patients  with persistent  FDG -PET/CT  abnormalities  will receive  2 cycles  of 
augmented  ICE chemotherapy  followed  by repeat  FDG -PET/CT.   We aim to evaluate  the 
rate of FDG-PET/CT  normalization  following  2 cycles  of weekly  brentuximab  vedotin  with or 
without  augmented  ICE in transplant  eligible  patients  with relapsed  or refractory  HL. This 
study  will enroll  46 patients.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Expansion  Cohort  
 
We will expand  this study  to include  20 additional  patients.   The expansion  would  again    
enroll  patients  who fail their front-line therapy  for HL; however  they will receive  3 cycles of 
weekly  BV followed  by reassessment  by FDG -PET.   Those  who score  Deauville  2 or better  
will proceed  to ASCT  while  all others  will receive  2 cycles of augmented  ICE prior to 
consideration  for ASCT.   We aim to evaluate  the rate of FDG-PET/CT  normalization  following  
3 cycles  of weekly  brentuximab  vedotin  with or without  augmented  ICE in transplant  eligible  
patients  with relapsed  or refractory  HL.

3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Introduction  
We have reported  that patients  with relapsed  or refractory  Hodgkin  lymphoma  (HL) who 
achieve  FDG -PET/CT  normalization  prior to autologous  stem  cell transplant  (ASCT)  have an 
excellent  outcome  with 5 year progression  free survival  of 75%.   Current  standard  salvage  
regimens  for relapsed  and refractory  HL include  ICE or DHAP  chemotherapy.   These  
regimens  are associated  with significant  hematologic  toxicity  and therefore  effective  and less 
toxic treatments  are needed.   Brentuximab  vedotin  (SGN -35) is well tolerated  and highly  
active  in patients  with relapsed  or refractory  HL who have failed  ASCT.   Weekly  
administration  of this agent  has yielded  complete  responses  in patients  after only 2 cycles  (8 
weeks)  making  this an attractive  agent  to test as a pre-ASCT  salvage  regimen.  
 
 
Pre-transplant  FDG -PET in Hodgkin  lymphoma  
 
The majority  of patients  with Hodgkin’s  Lymphoma  (HL) are cured  with radiation  therapy  
and/or  combination  chemotherapy.  However,  patients  who relapse  after attaining  a complete  
remission  with chemotherapy  and those  with primary  refractory  disease  have a poor outcome  
with conventional  salvage  regimens.   Randomized  studies  have established  high dose  
chemotherapy  followed  by autologous  stem  cell transplant  (ASCT)  as the standard  treatment  
for relapsed  or refractory  (rel/ref)  HL1, 2  following  response  to salvage  chemotherapy  (ST).  
Unfortunately,  about  50% of patients  with rel/ref  HL will fail ASCT  and the prognosis  for these  
patients  is grim3.  Since  1994,  4 consecutive  phase  II studies  have been  performed  at 
MSKCC  using  ICE (ifosfamide,  carboplatin,  and etoposide) -based  salvage  therapy  (ST) 
followed  by ASCT  for patients  demonstrating  chemosensitivity.   In the earliest  studies,

protocols  94-68 and 97-51, all patients  with rel/ref  HL received  uniform  ST with ICE followed  
by ASCT  and multivariate  analysis  identified  3 factors  that predicted  for outcome:  B 
symptoms,  extranodal  disease,  and complete  remission  less than 1 year from induction  
therapy4.  The next study,  98-71, employed  risk stratified  salvage  therapy  based  upon  the 
presence  of the 3 risk factors  (RFs)  identified  in the earlier  studies.   Patients  with 0-1 RFs 
received standard  ICE, 2 RFs received  increased  dose  ICE (“augmented  ICE”)  and patients  
with all three  RF received  tandem  transplants.   This risk stratified  approach  diminished  the 
prognostic  difference  between  low risk and higher  risk patients.   Furthermore,  an important  
finding  from this study  was that functional  imaging  (gallium  or FDG -PET)  status  before  ASCT  
strongly  predicted  outcome  following  transplant.   A combined  analysis  of patients  from 
protocols  94-68, 97-51, and 98-71 revealed  a 5 year EFS of 75% for patients  with functional  
imaging  (FI)–normalization  compared  to 31% for patients  with persistent  abnormalizations  on 
FI-suggesting  that normalization  of FI following  ST should  be a goal for patients  proceeding  
to ASCT  for rel/ref  HL.5    These  findings  led to the design  of our most  recent  study in rel/ref  
HL, 04-047, in which  patients  are again  treated  with risk stratified  ST; however  those  with 
persistent  abnormalities  on FI (FDG -PET/CT  primarily  used  in this study)  receive  additional  
non-cross  resistant  gemcitabine -based  (GND)  chemotherapy  before  ASCT.   FDG -PET/CT  
was repeated  after GND  and those  with responding  disease  proceeded  to ASCT.   Of 98 
patients  enrolled  on this study,  33 received  GND  for persistent  FDG-PET/CT  abnormalities;  
17 subsequently  achieved  FDG -PET/CT  normalization  following  GND  and had similar  
favorable  outcomes  to those  who achieved  FDG -PET/CT  normalization  from ICE alone6. 
These  findings  confirm  the notion  that normalization  of FDG -PET/CT  should  be the goal of 
ST prior to ASCT  in rel/ref  HL.  Our combined  analysis  of the 3 protocols,  94-68, 97-51, and 
98-71 also revealed  that patients  with persistent  pre-ASCT  FI abnormalities  who are 
ineligible  for involved  field radiation  (due to previous  radiation  therapy  or extranodal  disease)  
have particularly  poor outcomes  suggesting  that alternatives  to autologous  stem  cell 
transplant  (such  as allogeneic  stem  cell transplant)  should  be evaluated.5 
Factors  that predict  response  to ICE salvage  therapy  
 
All patients  have received  ICE-based  ST for rel/ref  HL at our institution  since  1994;  therefore  
we recently  pooled  this data to identify  factors  predictive  of FI normalization  following  ICE. 
Between  9/1994  and 4/2010,  277 patients  with rel/ref  HL were  treated  on 1 of 4 studies  
described  above.   Two hundred  and seventy -one patients  underwent  evaluation  with FI 
before  and after ST; 62% of these  patients  were  evaluated  with FDG -PET/CT.   One hundred  
sixty-five (60%)  patients  achieved  normalization  of functional  imaging  following  ST.  
Univariate  and multivariate  analysis  to identify  factors  associated  with failure  to normalize  FI 
was performed  and four factors  remained  significant  by multivariate  analysis:  bulk ≥ 5cm,  
relapse  within  previously  radiated  fields,  relapse  within  1 year of initial  treatment,  and 
presence  of B symptoms  at relapse.    The numbers  of patients  with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 risk  factors  
were  31, 100, 83, 38, and 4 and the rate of FI normalization  by risk factor  group  was 87%,  
76%,  50%,  34%,  and 0% respectively.    Patients  with 0-1 risk factors have a high rate of FI 
normalization  with ICE ST and may be candidates  for less intense  therapy.   In contrast,  
patients  with 3-4 risk factors  are at high risk for persistent  FI abnormalities  following  ICE 
treatment  and therefore  may benefit  from more  novel  salvage  therapy,  such  as an antibody - 
drug conjugate.   As described  below,  brentuximab  vedotin  (SGN -35) is a highly  effective  
treatment  in rel/ref  HL that is generally  well tolerated  and therefore  may represent  a better

option  for patients  both at low risk and high risk of failing  to normalize  FI following  ICE-based  
treatment,  therefore  we plan to treat all risk cohorts  with brentuximab  vedotin  with or without  
augmented  ICE and analyze  the results  according  to risk group.  
The majority  of patients  enrolled  on the MSKCC  studies  described  above  had 0-2 risk factors  
(risk factors  = b symptoms,  extranodal  disease,  and relapse  within  1 year).   Since  2004,  
patients  with all 3 risk factors  were  enrolled  on a different  study  evaluating  allogeneic  stem  
cell transplant  and therefore  are not well represented  in our ICE database.   The true rate of 
FDG-PET/CT  normalization  following  ICE chemotherapy  is therefore  likely lower  than 60%.  
On this protocol,  we will enroll  patients  with 0-3 risk factors  and therefore  we assumed  a 
lower  rate of FDG-PET/CT  normalization  from ICE chemotherapy  in our biostatistics.  
Brentuximab  vedotin  (SGN -35) 
 
Antibody -drug conjugates  (ADCs),  which  consist  of cytotoxic  agents  or toxins  chemically  
conjugated  to a monoclonal  antibody,  potentially  represent  an advantage  over treatment  with 
chemotherapy  because  they are designed  to deliver  the cytotoxic  agent  specifically  to tumor  
cells thereby  resulting  in an improved  safety  profile.  
Brentuximab  vedotin  (cAC10 -vcMMAE  [4]) is a novel  ADC that binds  to the cell-surface  
marker  CD30.  After binding  to CD30 -positive  cells,  brentuximab  vedotin  is internalized  
releasing  free MMAE  that leads  to cell death.  CD30  was originally  identified  on RS cells,  the 
malignant  cell in HL, and is now used  as a diagnostic  marker  for the disease.   Brentuximab  
vedotin  induces  growth  inhibition  of HL cell lines in vitro and inhibits  disease  progression  in 
both disseminated  and subcutaneous  HL xenograft  models  in immunodeficient  mice.  
Two phase  I studies  (evaluating  different  treatment  schedules)  and a phase  II study  
demonstrated  high efficacy  with acceptable  toxicity  for brentuximab  vedotin  in rel/ref  HL.  The 
first phase  I study  enrolled  45 patients  (42 with HL, 2 with systemic ALCL,  1 with 
angioimmunoblastic  T-cell lymphoma)  treated  at dose  levels  of 0.1 to 3.6 mg/kg  administered  
intravenously  every  3 weeks7. The most  common  adverse  events  were  fatigue,  pyrexia,  
diarrhea,  nausea,  neuropathy  peripheral,  and neutropenia.  Dose  related  peripheral  
neuropathy  and neutropenia  were  observed.  Notable  serious  adverse  events  considered  at 
least possibly  related  to treatment  included  anaphylaxis,  myocardial  infarction,  and peripheral  
neuropathy.  One patient  treated  with 3.6 mg/kg  died of septic  shock  (no organism  identified)  
and febrile  neutropenia  that were  considered  treatment  related.  The maximum  tolerated  dose  
of brentuximab  vedotin  was 1.8 mg/kg  administered  every  3 weeks.  Evidence  of objective  
responses  in this study  led to the phase  II study  with brentuximab  vedotin  1.8 mg/kg  q3week  
in relapsed  or refractory  HL8.  This study  enrolled  102 patients  with relapsed  and refractory  
HL following  ASCT.   The overall  response  rate was 75% and complete  response  rate 34%,  
establishing  brentuximab  vedotin  as a highly  effective  therapy  in rel/ref  and heavily  pre- 
treated  HL. 
The second  phase  I study  evaluated  weekly  administration  of brentuximab  vedotin  (day 1, 8, 
and 15 of 28 day cycles)9. The study  enrolled  44 patients,  86% with HL.  The maximum  
tolerated  dose  was determined  to be 1.2mg/kg  and the dose  limiting toxicities  were  diarrhea  
and hyperglycemia.   The incidence  of peripheral  neuropathy  seen  with this dosing  schedule  
was similar  to that seen  with every  3 week  dosing.   About  50% of patients  experienced  
peripheral  neuropathy,  mostly  grade  1 or 2.  Five patients  experienced  grade  3 peripheral

neuropathy,  3 with motor  neuropathies  after 4-9 months  of treatment  with brentuximab  
vedotin.   Thirteen  CRs and 9 PRs were  seen  with an overall  response  rate of 56%.   Most 
notable  was that the majority  of the complete  responses  were  seen  at the first restaging  
performed  8 weeks  into treatment  (following  2 cycles).  The tolerability,  efficacy,  and early 
responses  seen  with this dosing  schedule  make  this an attractive  agent  to test as a salvage  
therapy  prior to ASCT  in rel/ref  HL. 
Rationale  for salvage  therapy  with brentuximab  vedotin  
 
Standard  salvage  regimens  administered  before  ASCT,  such  as ICE or DHAP,  are inpatient  
therapies,  associated  with significant  hematologic  toxicity,  and risk of myelodysplastic  
syndrome  and infertility.   A therapy  that is less toxic but can still achieve  the same  rate of 
response  is desirable.   In particular,  avoiding  ICE chemotherapy,  but achieving  a similar  rate 
of chemosensitivity  using  less toxic therapy  would  be considered  a success.   Weekly  
brentuximab  vedotin  is an attractive  regimen  to test in this setting  because  it is associated  
with encouraging  response  rates,  and complete  responses  are seen  after only 8 weeks,  
which  is desirable  for a salvage  therapy  leading  to ASCT.   In this study,  transplant -eligible  
patients  with rel/ref  HL will receive  2 cycles  of weekly  brentuximab  vedotin.   FDG -PET/CT  will 
be performed  following  2 cycles  and patients  with PET-normalization  will proceed  to 
transplant.   Patients  with persistent  abnormalities  on FDG -PET/CT  will receive  standard  
salvage  treatment  with 2 cycles  of augmented  ICE chemotherapy  prior to proceeding  to 
ASCT.  
Rationale  for expansion  cohort  in patients  who fail front -line therapy  with brentuximab  
vedotin  
As of April 2013,  this study  had accrued  37 of the planned  46 patients  and 32 patients  were  
evaluable  for response.  Of the 32 evaluable  patients  enrolled  on this study,  9 (28%)  achieved  
normalization  of FDG-PET (referred  to as “excellent  responders”)  and proceeded  to ASCT.  
The remainder  of the patients  went on to receive  augmented  ICE.  Although  most  patients   
did not score  Deauville  2 on their post-BV PET,  the majority  of them  achieve  marked  
reduction  in their disease  burden  following  2 cycles  of BV (see table).   In fact, 4 of the  4 
patients  who scored  Deauville  3 and 10 of the 17 who scored  Deauville  4 achieved  greater  
than 66% reduction  in SUV max on PET or had residual  FDG-avidity  of SUV 4 or less 
(referred  to as “good  responders”).   Overall,  there  were  14 “good  responders”  and they 
represent  a group  of patients  who may have achieved  normalization  of FDG -PET following  
BV if they were  given  an additional  cycle  of weekly  BV. 
We therefore  propose  an expansion  to our current  study  for 20 additional  patients.   The 
expansion  would  again  enroll  patients  who fail their front-line therapy  for HL; however  they  
will receive  3 cycles  of weekly  BV followed  by reassessment  by FDG -PET.   Those  who score  
Deauville  2 or better  will proceed  to ASCT  while  all others  will receive  2 cycles  of augmented  
ICE prior to consideration  for ASCT.   We hypothesize  that administration  of 3 cycles  of BV  
will convert  more  “good  responders”  into “excellent  responders”  and allow  more  patients  to 
avoid  ICE chemotherapy  prior to consolidation  with ASCT.

Rationale  for correlative  studies  
 
Immunohistochemical  studies  
 
All patients  enrolled  on this study  will be required  to have biopsy  proven  relapsed  or 
refractory  HL.  This gives  us the opportunity  to prospectively  analyze  several  markers  on the 
biopsy  specimens  by immunohistochemistry.   Based  upon  the recent  report  of the prognostic  
significance  of CD68  (a marker  of tumor  associated  macrophages )10 on outcome  in newly  
diagnosed  HL, we will look at this marker  in our relapsed/refractory  population.   In addition,  
immunohistochemical  analysis  of HL biopsy  specimens  have shown  high expression  of TIA-1 
(markers  of cytotoxic  t cells)  and low expression  of FOXP3  (markers  of regulatory  T cells)  to 
be associated  with poor prognosis  both following  primary  treatmen t11  and in the 
relapsed/refractory  setting12.  We aim to confirm  these  observations  and evaluate  differences  
following  treatment  failure  by analyzing  these  markers  in both initial  biopsies  and 
relapsed/refractory  biopsies  for each  patient.  
 
ΔSUVmax  analysis  
 
For the purpose  of this study,  FDG-PET/CT  scans  will be interpreted  by visual  analysis   
where  areas  with uptake  greater  than the mediastinal  blood  pool will be considered  positive.  
Visual  analysis  of early interim  FDG -PET/CT  may not represent  the most  accurate  method  of 
interpretation.  Evaluation  of changes  in FDG  uptake  over time,  rather  than assessment  of 
findings  at a single  time point,  has been  proposed  as an alternative  assessment.  Intensity  of 
FDG  uptake  can be measured  as standardized  uptake  value,  SUV,  usually  measured  as 
highest  activity  concentration  per lesion,  or SUVmax.  Treatment  induced  changes  in SUV 
over time are referred  to as ΔSUVmax.  In patients  with previously  untreated  diffuse  large  B- 
cell lymphoma,  it has been  suggested  that these  changes  in SUV from baseline  to interim  
scan  after 2 cycles  of chemotherapy  may be more  accurate  than visual  assessment  of a 
single  scan13. These  authors  founds  that a ΔSUV max of -67.5%  between  FDG-PET/CT  
scans  performed  before  and after 2 cycles  of chemotherapy  reduced  the number  of false 
positive  results  and improved  the prognostic  value  of FDG -PET/CT  compared  to visual  
analysis.  We plan to explo re ΔSUVmax  between  FDG-PET/CT  scans  performed  before  
brentuximab  vedotin,  after two cycles  of brentuximab  vedotin  and after augmented  ICE (if

given)  as a predictor  of outcome.  This will be done  by retrospective  analysis  of the data set. 
No ΔSUVmax  will be defined  a priori  for determination  of treatment  strategy.  
Serum  cytokines  
 
Serum  levels  of various  cytokines  and TNF receptor  family  members  in patients  with HL have 
been  shown  to have prognostic  influence  on disease  outcome.   Sarris  et al. reported  the 
prognostic  significance  of serum  IL-10 levels  in previously  untreated  HL patients.   Among   
101 patients  evaluated,  3 year failure  free survival  (FFS)  for patients  with high verse  normal  
serum  IL-10 levels  was 60% and 91% respectively14.  Casasnovas  et al. described  a cytokine  
prognostic  index  that predicted  disease  related  outcome  in HL15.  They  evaluated  serum  
levels  of TNF receptors  (TNFα,  TNF-R1, TNF-R2, CD30),  and cytokines  (IL-6, IL-10, IL1-RA) 
in 519 patients  with untreated  classical  HL.  Elevated  levels  of TNFα,  TNF-R1, TNF-R2, IL1- 
RA, IL-10, IL6, and soluble  CD30  (sCD30)  were  associated  with inferior  event -free survival  
(EFS)  and overall  survival  (OS).  Furthermore,  a cytokine  prognostic  index  which  stratified  
patients  based  upon  elevated  serum  levels  of sCD30,  IL-6, and IL1-RA was a strong  
independent  predictor  of EFS.   The prognostic  significance  of cytokine  and TNF expression  
has not been  evaluated  in patients  with relapsed  and primary  refractory  HL.  We will evaluate  
serum levels  of IL-10, IL-6, IL-1, and TNFα  before  and after 2 cycles  of brentuximab  vedotin.  
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
Patients  with relapsed  or refractory  HL who are eligible  for ASCT  will be enrolled.   Patients  
will receive  2 cycles  of weekly  brentuximab  vedotin  and then undergo  evaluation  with FDG - 
PET/CT.   Patients  with pre-treatment  positive  bone  marrow  biopsies  will have  repeat  bone  
marrow  biopsies  if the PET scan  is negative.   Patients  with normalization  of FDG-PET/CT  
and negative  bone  marrow  biopsies  will proceed  to ASCT.   Patients  with persistent  
abnormalities  on FDG-PET/CT  will receive  2 cycles  of augmented  ICE chemotherapy  
followed  by repeat  FDG-PET/CT  prior to ASCT.   Following  augmented  ICE, patients  with 
negative  FDG-PET/CT  will proceed  to ASCT.   Those  with persistent  abnormalities  on FDG - 
PET/CT  will be treated  according  to their physician’s  recommendations.

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS 
Brentuximab  vedotin  (SGN -35) 
SGN -35, the investigational  treatment  in this protocol,  is an antibody -drug conjugate  
consisting  of the anti-CD30  antibody  cAC10  conjugated  to MMAE,   an anti-tubulin  agent.  
SGN -35 is a sterile,  preservative -free, white  to off-white  lyophilized  cake for reconstitution  for 
IV administration.  SGN -35 is supplied  by Seattle  Genetics  in single -use, Type  1 borosilicate  
glass  vials with FluroTec® -coated  butyl rubber  stoppers  and aluminum  seals.  Each  vial of the 
product  contains  SGN -35, trehalose,  sodium  citrate,  and polysorbate  80.  See the Pharmacy  
Manual  for further  information  (Appendix  1). 
 
Dose  and Administration  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -232 A(5)  
Approval date: 22 -Oct-2020  
Page  11 of 33  
  
 
 
SGN  -35 will be administered  on Day 1, 8, and 15 of each  28-day cycle.  The dose  of SGN -35 
is 1.2 mg/kg  and is administered  by outpatient  IV infusion  given  over approximately  30 
minutes.  In the absence  of infusion  toxicities,  the infusion  rate for all patients  must  be 
calculated  in order  to achieve  a 30-minute  infusion  period.  SGN -35 must  not be administered  
as an IV push  or bolus.  SGN -35 should  be administered  through  a dedicated  IV line. SGN -35 
cannot  be mixed  with other  medications.  
 
Dosing  should  be based  on actual  weight  except  for patients  weighing  greater  than 100 kg; 
dose  will be calculated  based  on 100 kg for these  individuals.  SGN -35 dose  should  be 
rounded  according  to institutional  standards.  
 
 
Required  Premedication and Postmedication  
Routine  premedication  should  not be administered  prior to the first dose  of SGN  -35. 
However,  patients  who experience  a Grade  1 or Grade  2 infusion -related  reaction  may 
receive  subsequent  SGN-35 infusions  with premedication  as described  below.  Patients  who 
experience  a Grade  3 or Grade  4 infusion -related  reaction  may potentially  receive  additional  
treatment  with SGN-35 at the discretion  of the Investigator.  
 
Management  of Infusion  Reactions  
Infusion -related  reactions  may occur  during  the infusion  of SGN -35. The infusion  should  be 
administered  at a site properly  equipped  and staffed  to manage  anaphylaxis  should  it occur.  
The patient  should  be observed  for 60 minutes  following  the first infusion  of SGN -35. During  
this observation  period,  the IV line should  remain  open  for at least 1 hour to allow  
administration  of IV drugs  if necessary.  All supportive  measures  consistent  with optimal  
patient  care will be given  throughout  the treatment  according  to institution  standards.  
Medications  for infusion -related  reactions,  such  as epinephrine,  antihistamines,  and 
corticosteroids,  should  be available  for immediate  use. 
A patient  who experiences  a Grade  1 or Grade  2 infusion -related  reaction  may receive  
subsequent  SGN -35 infusions  with premedication  consisting  of acetaminophen  (650 mg 
orally)  and diphenhydramine  (25-50 mg orally  or 10-25 mg IV) or according  to institutional  
standards,  administered  30-60 minutes  prior to each  30-minute  SGN -35 infusion.  The routine  
use of steroids  as premedication  is discouraged.  
Dose  Modifications  
Intrapatient  dose  reduction  to 0.8 mg/kg  will be allowed  depending  on the type and severity  
of toxicity.  The following  table describes  the recommended  dose  modifications  for study  
treatment -associated  toxicity.  
The start of the next cycle  may be delayed  for up to 3 weeks  if additional  time is required  for 
the patient  to recover  from study  treatment -associated  toxicity  experienced  during  the current  
cycle.  Doses  reduced  for drug-related  toxicity  should  generally  not be re-escalated.  However,  
intrapatient  re-escalation  to the previous  dose  level may be permitted  at the discretion  of the 
treating  physician.

9.0.1 EXPANSION  COHORT: TREATMENT INTERVENTION/PLAN 
 
Patients  will receive  3 cycles of weekly  brentuximab  vedotin,  1.2mg/kg  on days 1, 8, and 15 
of each  28 day cycle.   See section  5.0 for dosing  and administration  of brentuximab  vedotin.  
FDG-PET/CT  will be repeated  after 3 cycles of treatment  within  1 week  of the last dose  of 
cycle  3.  Patients  with pre-treatment  positive  bone  marrow  biopsies  will have repeat  bone  
marrow  biopsies  if the PET scan  is negative.   Patients  with normalization  of FDG-PET/CT  
and negative  bone  marrow  biopsies  after brentuximab  vedotin  will proceed  to arm A. 
Patients  with persistent  FDG -PET/CT  abnormalities  will proceed  to arm B. 
Arm A: Patients  with negative  FDG-PET/CT  following  3 cycles  of brentuximab  vedotin  will 
undergo  stem  cell mobilization  in preparation  for ASCT.  
Stem  cell mobilization  and collection  will be performed  as per standard  MSKCC  guidelines.

12.0 CRITERIAFOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESS MENT 
Criteria  for interim  FDG -PET/CT  assessment  
Patients  enrolled  in this study  will receive  salvage  treatment  with brentuximab  vedotin  and 
those  who achieve  FDG-PET/CT  normalization  will proceed  directly  to ASCT  without  
receiving  standard  salvage  chemotherapy  such  as ICE or DHAP.   Because  this treatment  
strategy  represents,  for some  patients,  a departure  from standard  practice,  or de-escalation  
of treatment,  stringent  criteria  are required  to designate  those  most  appropriate  for avoiding  
ICE chemotherapy.   A five-point scale  for assessing  response  on interim  FDG-PET/CT  
scans,  referred  to as the “London  criteria”,  was developed  by international  experts  in Nuclear  
Medicine  and Oncology  for use in diffuse  large  B cell lymphoma  and HL17  and validated  for 
use as interim  assessment  in HL patients.18    The 5-point scale  is displayed  in the following  
table.  
 
Score  FDG-PET/CT  scan  result  
1 No uptake  above  background  
2 Uptake  ≤ mediastinum  
3 Uptake  > mediastinum  but ≤ liver 
4 Uptake  moderately  more  than liver uptake,  
at any site 
5 Markedly  increased  uptake  at any site or 
new sites of disease

Approval date: 22 -Oct-2020  
Page  24 of 33  
  
 
The score  on this scale  used  to define  a normal  or abnormal  scan  depends  upon  the 
particular  clinical  strategy  planned.   For example,  when  escalation  of treatment  is planned  
based  upon  FDG-PET/CT  results,  defining  an abnormal  FDG -PET/CT  by a score  of 4 or 5 is 
appropriate  to avoid  overtreating  patients.   Conversely,  when  de-escalation  of treatment  is 
planned  based  upon  FDG-PET/CT  results,  defining  a persistently  abnormal  FDG -PET/CT  by 
a score  of 3, 4, or 5 is appropriate  in order  to avoid  undertreating  patients.  
For the purpose  of this study,  a score  of 1 or 2 will be considered  a “normal”  FDG-PET/CT  
scan  because  de-escalation  of treatment  is anticipated.   All scores  (1 through  5) will be 
recorded  for each  FDG-PET/CT  scan  and scans  will be reviewed  by either  Dr. Grewal  or Dr. 
Schöder.  
Progression  free survival  (PFS)  and overall  survival  (OS)  will be calculated  from the time of 
initiation  of brentuximab  vedotin.  
The response  criteria  developed  by the International   Harmonization  Project  for response  
assessment  in lymphoma  will be used  to define  complete  response,  partial  response,  and 
progression  of disease  in this study19.  The definitions  for response  are detailed  in the table 
below.  
 
 
 
 
13.1 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients  will be followed  on study  until progression  of disease  or 2 years  following  autologous  
stem  cell transplant.  
 
The following  patients  will be removed  from study:

• Patients  who have progression  of disease  while  on treatment.  These  patients  may 
be offered  alternate  treatments.  
• Patients  who develop  unacceptable  toxicity.  
• Patients  who request  that they be removed  from study.  This will not compromise  the 
care they receive  at this institution.  
• Patients  who are non-compliant  with treatment  or follow -up. 
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
For the primary  objective  of this study,  we will employ  a Simon  two stage  design.  Currently,  
the FDG-PET/CT  normalization  rate for ICE alone  is between  50-60% therefore  for a new 
treatment  regimen,  we would  consider  a normalization  rate of 40% unacceptable.    The goal 
of this study  is to replace  an intense  inpatient  regimen  with an effective,  less toxic regimen  
without  impacting  efficacy.  Thus,  we will set the desirable  FDG-PET/CT  normalization  rate aa 
60% for the new treatment  regimen  (i.e., SGN -35 with or without  ICE) and we will use 40%  
as our null hypothesis  in employing  the Simon  two stage  design.  In the first stage,  we will 
enroll  18 relapsed  or refractory  Hodgkin  lymphoma  patients  who meet  the criteria  in Section  
6. If 7 or fewer  patients  achieve  FDG -PET/CT  normalization  either  after SGN -35 alone  or 
after SGN -35 combined  with ICE, no additional  patients  will be enrolled  and the regimen  will 
be considered  not promising  in this cohort  of patients.  If 8 or more  patients  are FDG- 
PET/CT  negative  either  after SGN -35 alone  or after SGN -35 with ICE, then an additional  28 
patients  will be enrolled  for the second  stage.  Among  the total 46 patients,  If 23 or more  
patients  achieve  FDG-PET/CT  normalization  either  after SGN -35 alone  or after SGN -35 with 
ICE, this treatment  regimen  will be declared  effective.  This decision  rule has both type I error 
(declaring  the new treatment  regimen  promising  while  it is actually  not) and type II error 
(declaring  the new treatment  regimen  not promising  while  it actually  is) rate as 0.10.  The 
early stopping  (i.e., stop after the first stage  with 18 patients)  probability  is 0.56 when  the 
FDG-PET/CT  normalization  rate is 40%,  and is 0.06 when  the FDG -PET/CT  normalization  
rate is 60%.   We expect  it will take 2-3 years  to enroll  46 patients.  
Furthermore,  additional  stopping  rules are in place  if we observe  an unacceptable  amount  of 
toxicity  due to SGN -35 or an unacceptable  rate of relapse  following  transplant  in the SGN - 
35-only group  among  the first 18 patients.   We have defined  an unacceptable  rate of toxicity  
as grade  3 or more  neuropathy  occurring  in 5 of the first 18 patients  enrolled.   We have 
defined  an unacceptable  relapse  rate as a 50% rate of relapse  within  3 months  of transplant  
among  the SGN -35-only patients.  
As an additional  criterion,  we require  that at least 7 out of the total 46 patients  (15%)  achieve  
FDG-PET/CT  normalization  after SGN-35 to call this new regimen  a success.  The purpose  of 
this criterion  is to exclude  the situation  that all patients  may fail SGN -35 (i.e., persistent  PET 
abnormalities)  and hence  must  receive  ICE salvage  therapy,  yet accidently  pass the above  
two-stage  design.  The threshold  15% was chosen  because  the previous  phase  I data show  
that about  30% of patients  may achieve  CR with SGN -35, and thus we believe  it would  be 
clinically  meaningful  to require  at least 15% of patients  to achieve  PET normalization  after 
SGN -35 to call it a success.  
For the secondary  objectives,  we will report  the stratified  FDG -PET/CT  normalization  rates   
as sample  proportions  with their confidence  intervals.  Overall  response  rate to SGN -35 alone  
will be reported  similarly.  Toxicities  will be summarized  and tabulated.  PFS and OS (see

definition  in Section  12) will be analyzed  using  standard  survival  tools such  as Kaplan -Meier  
estimation,  log-rank tests  and/or  Cox regression  models  to incorporate  various  factors  (such  
as ∆SUVmax,  CD68,  FoxP3,  TIA-1, serum  cytokine,  etc.) and assess  their correlation  with 
PFS and/or  OS. Competing  risks analysis  will be conducted  if competing  risk(s)  exists  (such  
as death  without  progression).  Lab results  including  CD34  cell yield following  mobilization  will 
be reported  as summary  statistics.  
14.0.1  EXPANSION COHORT: BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This study  would  be an expansion  of our current  study  and therefore  the data will ultimately  
be analyzed  along  with the data from our current  study  in which  patients  are receiving  2 
cycles  of BV.  The goal of this expansion  study  is to determine  whether  the rate of FDG-PET 
normalization  is improved  with 3 cycles  of BV when  compared  to 2 cycles.  So far, we have 
observed  a 28% rate of FDG -PET normalization  following  2 cycles  of BV; however  an 
additional  14 patients  (44%)  were  "good  responders"  to 2 cycles  of BV and likely had the 
potential  to achieve  FDG -PET normalization  had they received  an additional  cycle  of BV. 
Based  upon  this, we estimate  that the rate of FDG -PET normalization  following  3 cycles  of 
BV will be around  50%.  
Allowing  for type I and type II error rates  of 0.2, and assuming  a FDG -PET normalization  rate 
of 28% with 2 cycles  of BV, the number  of patients  required  to show  an improvement  in FDG - 
PET normalization  rate to 50% is 20.

16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
were  approved  by the National  Cancer  Institute  in September  2001.  The plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth by the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  
Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at  
http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/conducting/dsm  -guidelines . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  
were  established  and are monitored  by the Office  of Clinical  Research.  The MSKCC  Data

and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:  
http://mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/html/99073.cfm  
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical  trials are monitored  for data,  safety  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff 
education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus 
there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.  The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring   Committee  (DSMC)  for 
Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III 
clinical  trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) Will be addressed  
and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
Section  16.3 Regulatory  Documentation  
 
Prior to implementing  this protocol  at MSK,  the protocol,  informed  consent  form,  HIPAA  
authorization  and any other  information  pertaining  to participants  must  be approved  by the 
MSK Institutional  Review  Board/Privacy  Board  (IRB/PB).  There  will be one protocol  
document  and each  participating  site will utilize  that document.  
 
Participating  sites that are conducting  data analysis  should  submit  this protocol  to their IRB 
according  to local guidelines.  Copies  of any site IRB correspondence  should  be forwarded  to 
MSK.  
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
Potential  Risks  
Traditionally,  we have used  ICE chemotherapy  as the initial  salvage  therapy  in 
relapsed/refractory  HL.  In this study,  ICE chemotherapy  is either  eliminated  or delayed  until 
treatment  with SGN -35 is completed.   In the phase  II studies  described  above,  SGN -35 was 
associated  with tumor  reduction  in over 90% of patients  with relapsed/refractory  HL.  While  
delaying  or eliminating  ICE chemotherapy  represents  a potential  risk for patients  enrolled  in 
this protocol,  this potential  risk is minimal  given  the high activity  of SGN -35. 
Potential  Benefits  
 
While  ICE-based  salvage  treatment  is commonly  administered  for relapsed/refractory  HL it is 
associated  with significant  toxicity.   Patients  enrolled  on this trial who achieve  FDG -PET/CT  
negativity  following  2 cycles  of SGN -35 will proceed  directly  to ASCT.   Therefore,  a portion  of 
patients  enrolled  on this study  may avoid  ICE-based  treatment.   Furthermore,  Seattle  
Genetics  is supplying  SGN -35 free of charge.  
Provisions  for preventing and treating  adverse  events  
 
Assessment  for neuropathy  will be performed  before  each  cycle  of brentuximab  vedotin.  
Treatment  of febrile  neutropenia,  cytopenias,  ifosfamide -related  gross  and microscopic

hematuria,  and catheter  related  sepsis,  thrombosis,  and pneumothorax  will be in accordance  
with standard  medical  practices  employed  at MSKCC.  
Patients  will receive  standard  anti-emetics  as prophylaxis  against  nausea  and vomiting.  
 
Alternatives/Options for treatment 
 
For patients  eligible,  alternative  therapy  would  consist  of ICE-based  salvage  therapy  or 
DHAP  chemotherapy.  
Costs  
 
The patient  will be responsible  for all costs  related  to treatment  and complications  of 
treatment,  including  G-CSF,  pegfilgrastim,  FDG-PET scans,  and all hospitalizations.  
SGN -35 will be supplied  by Seattle  Genetics  free of charge.   The patient  will not be 
responsible  for the cost of correlative  studies.  
Participation  in this study  is voluntary  and patients  will not be paid for participation.  
 
Privacy and confidentiality  
 
Confidentiality  will be maintained  within  the limits  of the law. Only qualified  individuals  from 
MSKCC;  the National  Cancer  Institute;  the FDA;  Seattle  Genetics;  will be able to review  
patients'  medical  records.  Neither  the patients'  names  nor other  identifying  information  will be 
used  in reports  or publications  arising  from this study.  After all patients  have completed  
treatment  on study  and primary  data analysis  is complete,  FDG-PET/CT  scans  will be de- 
identified  (only patient  weight  and study  ID number  will be shared)  and sent on a CD via mail 
to LYSA  Imaging  at Hôpitaux  Universitaires  Henri  Mondor,  France  for data analysis.  
 
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by the Principal  
Investigator  and approved  by the IRB and Privacy  Board  (IRB/PB).  
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
Any SAE must  be reported  to the IRB/PB  as soon  as possible  but no later than 5 calendar  
days.  The IRB/PB  requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE Office  at sae@mskcc.org .  The report  should  contain  the following  
information:  
 
Fields  populated  from CRDB:  
 
• Subject’s  name  (generate  the report  with only initials  if it will be sent outside  of 
MSKCC)

For IND/IDE  protocols:  
The CRDB  AE report  should  be completed  as above  and the FDA assigned  IND/IDE  number  
written  at the top of the report.  If appropriate,  the report  will be forwarded  to the FDA by the 
SAE staff through  the IND Office.  
17.2.1  SAE reporting  information  to Seattle  Genetics  
 
• Reporting  Timeframe:  The Principal  Investigator  will report  to Seattle  Genetics  
 
Drug  Safety  by facsimile  (425)  527-4308  or (866)  333-6627  (USA  only toll free) 
any Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  that occurs in a study  subject  within  24 hours  
of first awareness  of the event.  
• Reporting  Forms:  The Principal  Investigator  will report  such  SAEs  using  the 
Seattle  Genetics  SAE Report  Form  or the approved  local regulatory  form 
SAEs  should  be reported  as soon  as they are determined  to meet  the 
definition,  even if complete  information  is not yet available.  
• Reporting  Period:  The reportable  events  that are subject  to this provision  are 
those  that occur  from the start of administration  of the first dose  of the Product  
through  thirty  (30) days after discontinuation  of the Product.  SAEs  occurring  
more  than thirty (30) days after discontinuation  of the Product  that are assessed  
by the Investigator  as related  to the Product  should  also be reported.

• Follow -up Information:  The Principal  Investigator  will assist  Seattle  Genetics  in 
investigating  any SAE and will provide  any follow -up information  reasonably  
requested  by Seattle  Genetics.  
• Regulatory  Reporting:  Reporting  an SAE to Seattle  Genetics  does not relieve  
the Principal  Investigator  conducting  the study  of the responsibility  for reporting  it 
to the FDA,  local regulatory  authority,  or IRB/IEC  as required.  
18.1 INFORMED  CONSENT  PROCEDURES

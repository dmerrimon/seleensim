Supplement: Version 9 3. Introduction  
Background 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common, chronic, progressive, skeletal, degenerative disorder that 
frequently affects several joints such as knee, hip, spine and hands. OA is associated with damage to the cartilage and surrounding tissues and characterized by pain, stiffness, and loss of function. ( 1) Being a highly prevalent disease and a main form of arthritis, OA is the most 
common cause of disability in the U.S. In fact, 52.5 million U.S. adults (approximately 1 in 4) aged ≥18 years have self-reported having doctor- diagnosed arthritis according to 2010-2012 
data collected by the National Health Interview Survey. ( 2)  The incidence of large joint OA 
in the U.S., particularly of the knee, is predicted to increase with the aging of the population and obesity epidemic. ( 3)  
Currently, a variety of prescription and over-the- counter (OTC) medicat ions are available. 
Acetaminophen has been a mainstay of OA pharmacological management for many years and has been tested in many clinical trials  although its effectiveness in clinical trials appears 
limited . (4) An extended release (ER) formulation containing acetaminophen 650 mg in a 
bilayer form has been shown to be more efficacious than placebo in hip and knee OA. ( 5)  
Each caplet contains 650 mg of acetaminophen.  The maximum daily dose is 3900 mg. 
Aleve®, naproxen sodium, the sodium salt of naproxen, was developed as an analgesic 
because it is more rapidly absorbed than naproxen.  It is available as an OTC analgesic/antipyretic that temporarily reduces fever and relieves minor aches and pains due to: minor pain of arthritis, muscular aches, backache, menstrual cramps, headache, toothache, and the common cold. OTC doses of naproxen sodium have been shown to be efficacious for relieving OA pain. ( 6, 7, 8)  Each tablet contains 220 mg of naproxen sodium with a 
maximum daily dose of 660 mg. 
Celecoxib, a COX -2 selective NSAID, is a commonly used prescription analgesic for OA and 
its efficacy is supported by a large body of data. ( 9)  For relief of the signs and symptoms of 
OA the recommended oral dose is 200 mg per day.   Along with pain, stiffness is a frequent symptom of OA. ( 6) The Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), a commonly  used patient reported 
outcome (PRO) instrument for the measur ement of OA -related joint pain and physical 
function includes a 2-item subscale for measuring joint stiffness. ( 10)   However, the 
WOMAC’s 2 -item subscale for measuring joint stiffness shows low test- retest reliability . (11)  
FDA has informed Bayer that the WOMAC s tiffness subscale has not been accepted as a 
stand -alone measure suitable for use as an endpoint.   
In order to examine the efficacy of treatments on improving joint stiffness, the Brief Arthritis 
Stiffness Scale (BASS), a PRO instrument designed specifically to measure stiffness was developed and validated for use in clinical trials.  A non-interventional study has previously been conducted to examine the psychometric properties of the BASS.  The study provided evidence for the reliability, construct valid ity, and discriminant validity of both the daily and 
weekly average BASS score, as well as preliminary responder thresholds.   Further evaluation of the BASS to assess the instrument’s responsiveness to treatment is needed.  A study including an active int ervention will provide information to formally evaluate the instrument’s 
ability to detect change and provide utility for the responder definition.  
This placebo -controlled clinical trial will assess the effects of naproxen sodium, 
acetaminophen and celeco xib on stiffness in subjects with OA.  Furthermore, data will be

Subjects with OA of the knee who would typically take over-the-counter (OTC) nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain relief will be enrolled in this study.  The 4 day 
treatment duration falls within established treatment guidelines. ( 12)  
During the study, subjects will be closely monitored for evidence of adverse events.  Potential 
risks to subjects participating in this study include the risks  associated with OTC analgesic 
use and the risk of inadequate relief in placebo- treated subjects.  Subjects will be given the 
option of taking rescue therapy  between each Treatment Period.  Given the ability to mitigate 
risk through close monitoring, this study is considered clinically and ethically acceptable.

Primary  
• To assess the responsiveness of the Brief Arthritis Stiffness Scale (BASS) for 
detecting treatment effects of common OTC analgesics and a common prescription 
analgesic in subjects  with knee OA.  
Exploratory 
• To assess the assay sensitivity of the STaircase- Evoked P ain Procedure (STEPP™) to 
detect treatment effects of commonly used analgesics compared to placebo and to detect differences between active treatments;  
 
• To determine/identify effect size measurements, determine single dose vs. multi-dose 
efficacy, identify optimal sample size, and logistical issues for planning comparative 
analgesic efficacy studies using the STEPP.  
 
• To assess levels of activity captured by the accelerometer between active treatments 
and placebo during Days 1 (partial), 2 and 3 of the Treatment Phase.  
 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of naproxen sodium , celecoxib  and 
acetaminophen  ER.

Supplement: Version 9 5. Study design  
5.1 Design Overview - amend ment 1 and 2  
This is a multi-center, randomized, double- blind, 4-period crossover, placebo-controlled pilot 
trial in male and female adult subjects with pain due to OA of the knee.  At the completion of 
Screening and Baseline Phases, eligible subjects will be randomized to a blinded treatment sequence of naproxen sodium, acetaminophen ER, celecoxib and placebo.    The trial consists of a n up to 14 day Screening Phase, a 4 (+3) day Screening Washout Phase 
and a Treatment Phase consisting of four 4 -day treatment periods s eparated by washout 
periods lasting several days.  The study center may schedule screening testing on multiple days as needed provided all screening tests are done within 14 days.  Approximately 192 subjects will be screened with 62 eligible to start the Screening Washout Phase.  
Approximately 12 subjects are anticipated to fail baseline randomization criteria to obtain approximately 50 randomized subjects of whom approximately 10 are anticipated to drop out leaving approximately 40 completed subjects.  Screening Phase Visit 1 - (Day -18 to -5) 
 Eligible subjects will be selected within a period of up to 14 days prior to the start of the Screening Washout Phase of the trial.  Subjects are required to have a diagnosis of OA of the 
knee based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) clinical criteria prior to inclusion 
into the trial.  The target knee will need to be identified per inclusion criteria (exam, radiographs and pain scores). In addition, the subject must have an average score of ≥3.0 on the WOMAC pain subscale (0 -10 numeric rating scale [NRS] 48-hour recall version) at 
Screening  AND/OR  a 24 -hour A verage Pain I ntensity  score of ≥3 on the 0-10 NRS and a 
Joint  Stiffness Severity score ≥3 on a 0-10 NRS.  If OA is present in both knees, the more 
painful knee will be considered the target knee. Subjects will receive accurate pain reporting training, and training on appropriate expectations for a clinical trial.    Additionally, subjects must self -report that they have experienced knee stiffness at lea st 5-7 days  per week over the 
past month as reported on the Baseline Stiffness Questionnaire.  Subjects will be instructed to discontinue use of all pain medications including supplements and topicals at the start of the Screening Washout phase (Day -4 to -1 +3 days) through trial 
completion, other than investigational medicinal product (IMP) or rescue medication provided by the study site .  Subjects will choose a daily wake-up time to establish a dosing routine that 
will be entered in a diary.   The range for wake -up hours must be between 5:00 am and 9:00 
am.  Subjects will need to commit to following a consistent wake -up routine for the duration 
of the trial.  
 Screening Washout Phase (Day -4 to Day -1+3 days)  
Eligible subjects will start a minimum 4 -day Screening Washout Phase.  Subjects will be 
required to abstain from taking all pain medications , including topicals, and supplements 
during the entire 4- day Screening Washout Phase, with the exception noted below. 
If needed, subjects can return to the study center up to 3 days after the completion of the Screening Washout Phase provided all current medication restrictions are maintained.

Supplement: Version 9 Subjects can take acetaminophen (up to 2000 mg/day) provided by the study site during this 
Screening Washout Phase, but not within 24 hours of the Randomization visit (Day 1 of 
Treatment Period 1).  No other analgesic medications are permitted.  
 
Start of Treatment Period X of 4 - Visit 2 (Day 1)  
Subjects will return to the study  center upon completion of the Screening Was hout Phase or 
between -treatment Washout Period.  To be eligible for randomization prior to Treatment 
Period 1, subjects must meet the following randomization criteria: self -reported average score 
of ≥4 on the WOMAC pain subscale (0-10 NRS, 48-hour recall version) related to OA pain in 
the target knee; current pain intensity score of ≥4 and ≤9 on the 0-10 NRS; and, a score of ≥4 on the 0-10 NRS for average pain over the past 24-hours.  In addition, the Day 1 baseline post-STEPP current pain intensity 0-10 NRS score must be ≥5, and ≥1 unit higher than the pre-STEPP current pain intensity 0-10 NRS score.   
Subjects who do not meet all the randomization criteria will be considered a Screening failure and will not be randomized into the study.  Subjects who qua lify will be asked additional 
questions related to knee pain, stiffness and function. 
Randomized subjects will receive their treatment period specific investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) or treatment kit that includes study medication at the start of e ach treatment 
period.  Randomization occurs only once during the start of the first treatment period. 
Subjects will take their first dose of IMP from the treatment kit while at the study center and 
will undergo the STEPP periodically over the next 8 hours to induce knee pain.  Subjects will complete pain assessments over 8 hours post-dose, take their afternoon ( approximately 4 pm) 
dose after all assessments are complete, and then will be discharged from the study center.  Following discharge from the study center, subjects will take the next two doses of IMP at 
home approximately as directed for a total of 4 doses on Day 1. 
During the completion of Visit 2, subjects will be fitted with an accelerometer to measure the 
number of steps taken and level of activity (e.g., low, medium, high).  A ccelerometer data 
collection  will start after completion of the Day 1 activities prior to leaving the study site.   
Day 2 and Day 3 
The morning following Day 1, subjects will continue with the same blinded treatment.  On 
Day 2 and 3, subjects will be asked to complete the 24-hour BASS assessments and will then 
take their first (morning) dose of IMP.  Subjects will continue to take their IMP as directed for a total of 4 doses per day.  Subjects will continue to wear their accelerometer except when showering or bathing. 
No rescue therapy  will be allowed.  
End of Treatment Period X of 4 - Visit 3 (Day 4)  
Subjects will return to the study center wearing their accelerometer.  They must bring  their 
diary  and treatment kit with remaining study medication.  The accelerometer will be removed 
at the study site prior to the pre- dose STEPP .  Subjects will complete pain, stiffness and 
function assessments.  Subjects will then take their final remaining IMP morning dose in the 
(X of 4) treatment sequence.  Subjects will undergo the STEPP to induce knee pain 
periodically over the next 8 hours.  Subjects will complete pain assessments hourly over the 8 hours post-dose and then will be discharged from the study center to start the washout period.

Supplement: Version 9 Washout between Treatment Periods 
Subjects will start a new Washout Period following the completion of Visit 3 (Day 4) of each 
Treatment Period  (except Treatment Period 4) . The Washout Period will last from 3 to 7 days 
after Visit 3.  Subjects will not be allowed to take any pain medication not dispensed by the study center.  Subjects can take acetaminophen (up to 2000 mg/day) provided by the study 
site during this Washout Period but not within 24 hours of Day 1 of the next Treatment 
Period.  Subjects will be scheduled to return to the study center to start the next Treatment Period (X of 4) for Day 1, Visit 2. 
End of Study (follow up) – after Visit 3, Treatment Period 4 of 4 Subjects will receive a follow up phone call to assess adverse events and document any new 
concomitant medications.  Additionally, subjects will participate in a semi-structured qualitative interview about their experiences in the clinical trial.  Upon c ompletion of all trial 
procedures, subjects will be discharged from the study. 
The duration of each subject’s participation will be approximately 68 days. For an overview 
on the trial design and trial procedures see Figure 1. 
5.2 Study Methodology 
The study is a multi-center double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled design 
with four treatment periods  conducted in the United States.  Approximately 3- 5 sites will be 
utilized for recruitment.  
 
5.3 Selection of Study Population - amendment 2  
All male and female potential subjects 40 to 80 years of age with OA of the knee who would 
typically take OTC NSAIDs for pain relief may be eligible to  participate in the study provided 
they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Supplement: Version 9 Justification of the design 
The pilot study was designed to capture pain and stiffness data in subject s who could benefit 
from the administration of an OTC pain reliever.  OTC pain relievers are commonly used to 
treat the pain of OA.  Th e STEPP  pain model has been included in multiple studies of new 
and approved medications  to treat pain due to OA of the knee , and is expected to increase 
treatment effects  observed in this study.   By including the STEPP in this study, standardized 
effect sizes can be assessed under short -term use conditions.  
 
Accurate Pain Reporting Training The Accurate Pain Reporting Program ( “Reporting Your Pain,”  Analgesic Solutions, 
Wayland , MA) consists of a set of subject and staff educational materials and instructions on 
how to accurately and reliably report pain scores, and on the proper use of pain intensity 
scales, with the aim of increasing subjects’ pain reporting accuracy.  Staff training is conducted prior to the first subject visit. Subjects receive training at the Screening Visit, and at on Day 1 of each of the four Treatment Periods.  The train ing video takes approximately 30 
minutes and should be completed prior to pain assessments. 
 Appropriate Expectations Training This training ( “Participating in a Research Study, What you need to know, ” Analgesic 
Solutions, Wayland , MA) also consists of a set of subject and staff educational materials for 
training on appropriate expectations of personal benefit while participating in a clinical trial.  
The purpose is to provide subjects truthful information that will neutralize the typically excessive expectations that drive high placebo responses in clinical trials.  Subjects receive training at the Screening Visit, and at on Day 1 of each of the four Treatment Periods.  The training video takes approximately 30 minutes and should be completed prior to pain assessments.

Supplement: Version 9 6.3  Justification of selection criteria  
The selection criteria are chosen to ensure that subject s with specific risks for administration 
of the study medication and/or subject s with conditions which may have an impact on the 
safety of the subject or data integrity during their participation in the study are excluded.  
6.4 Withdrawal of subject s from study 
6.4.1 Withdrawal 
Withdrawal criteria  
Subject s must  be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occurs : 
• At their own request or at the request of their legally acceptable representative. At any 
time during the study and without giving reasons, a subject  may decline to participate 
further.  The subject  will not suffer any disadvantage as a result.  
Subject s may be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occurs: 
• Serious adverse events ; 
• If, in the Investigator's opinion, continuation of the study would be harmful to the 
subject 's well -being;  
• At the specific request of the Sponsor and in liaison with the Investigator (e.g., obvious non- compliance, safety concerns);  
• Protocol violation: if the subject  develops conditions which would have prevented 
entry into the study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the subject  must be 
withdrawn immediately if safety is concerned; in other cases, the investigator will 
decide whether there is a conflict with the study objectives  
Depending on the time point of withdrawal, a withdrawn subject  is referred to as either a 
“screening failure ” or “ dropout ” as specified below:  
Screening failure  
A subject  who, for any reason ( e.g., failure to satisfy the selection criteria), terminates the 
study prior to randomization is r egarded as a “screening failure”.  
Re-starting the defined set of screening procedures (re -screening) to enable the “screening 
failure” subject ’s participation at a later time point is not allowed – with the following 
exceptions:  
• The subject  had successfully passed the screening procedures, but could not start 
subsequent treatment on schedule. 
• Initial screening occurred too early to complete the required washout period after prior 
therapy.  
• The in - / exclusion criteria preventing the subject ’s initial attempt to participate have 
been changed (via protocol amendment).

Reference Number: BHC- RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 9 • Other situations where the subject  had to withdraw consent due to “li fe circumstances” 
though they otherwise qualified.  These situations will be considered on a case by case 
basis by the sponsor or sponsor representative in consultation with the investigator. 
In any case, the investigator has to ensure that the repeated screening procedures do not expose the subject  to an unjustifiable health risk .  Also, for re- screening, the subject  has to re-
sign the informed consent  form, e ven if it was not changed after the subject ’s previous 
screening . 
Dropout 
A subject  who discontinues study participation prematurely for any reason is defined as a 
“dropout” if the subject has been randomized and administered at least one dose of study 
drug. 
General procedures  
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in t he case report form/electronic 
case report form (CRF/eCRF)  data collection system  and progress noted in the subject 's 
medical records.   
The subject  may object to the generation and processing of post- withdrawal data as specified 
in Section  13.4. 
Details for the premature termination of the study as a whole (or components thereof) are 
provided in Section 12 ( Premature termination of the Study ). 
6.4.2 Replacement 
Subject s who prematurely discontinue participation after randomization will not be replaced. 
6.5 Subject  identification 
Each subject  is identified by the study site’s unique subject  identification code. After 
informed consent procedure every subject  is given a screening number (SNR). At the time 
point of randomization, subjects who meet the entry criteria will be sequentially assigned to a four-digit number in ascending order (randomization number, RNR).  See Section  7.3. 
7. Treatment(s) 
The study center will dispense a blinded treatment  sequence a fter successfully completing 
screening and baseline assessments .  The overencapsulated tablets  or capsules  (IMP) for each 
treatment sequence will be dispensed using a computer generated randomization schedule.

The source of test and reference products will be documented in the clinical supply file.  
7.3 Treatment assignment - amend ment 1 
At the beginning of the first treatment period, after completion of the pre- treatment baseline 
procedures/assessments, subject s who meet the entry criteria will be sequentially assigned to a 
unique number in ascending order (randomization number, RNR) according to the 
randomization schedule prepared prior to the study .  
Subject s will be number ed according to the following scheme: 
14001XXXX  
Whereas the “Xs” will be replaced with a four digit sequentially assigned number as each subject  enters the study (e.g. , first subject  number of the study will be ). 
Once a number has been assigned to a subject , it cannot be reassigned to another subject .   
Subjects who do not meet all of the randomization criteria will not be randomized.  Upon 
successful completion of all remaining inc lusion and exclusion criteria, subjects enter the 
Treatmen t Phase and are randomized into one of four blinded treatment sequences using a 
Williams design to ensure a balanced stratification.  See example below :

• Treatment A: Naproxen sodium 660 mg (three tablets of naproxen sodium 220 mg and 
five tablets of placebo daily); On Days 1, 2 and 3, first dose of two tablets of naproxen in the morning at 8:00 AM ± 1 hour followed by two tablets of placebo 8 hours later at 4:00 PM ± 1 hour, followed by one tablet of naproxen and one tablet of placebo 4 hours later at 8  PM ± 1 hour, followed by two tablets of placebo 4 hours later at 12 
AM ± 1 hour; 
 
• Treatment B: Acetaminophen 3900 mg (six tablets of acetaminophen 650 mg and two 
tablets  of placebo daily); On Days 1, 2 and 3, first dose of two tablets of 
acetaminophen in the morning at 8:00 am ± 1 hour followed by two tablets of 
acetaminophen 8 hours later at 4:00 PM ± 1 hour followed by two tablets of placebo 4 hours later at 8 PM ± 1 hour followed by two tablets of acetaminophen 8 hours later at 12 AM ± 1 hour;  
• Treatment  C: Celecoxib 200 mg (two capsules of celecoxib 100 mg and six tablets of

later at 8 PM ± 1 hour followed by two tablets of placebo 8 hours later at 12AM ± 1 hour.  Note:  The Day 4 treatment is a single morning (8 AM) two tablet/capsule dose similar 
to the morning dosing for Days 1-3. 
7.4 Dosage and administration 
Subjects will follow the dosing schedule as outlined in Section 7.1.  The blister package will be blinded to the specific treatments in the sequence.  All subjects will randomly receive one drug treatment (A, B, C or D) during each dosing period.  Depending upon which treatment in the sequence, they could be taking naproxen sodium, acetaminophen, celecoxib or placebo.  
Subject s will administer the d rug with a full glass of non-refrigerated, non- carbonated wat er 
(about 8 ounces or 240 mL).   
The subject  will bring their dosing blister pack age  with them to each visit.  The 
 bliste
r electronically records the date and time when the subjects depresses the blister 
to take a dose of IMP.  The study center will download and review the dosing data from the 
 blister package for compliance.   Any deviations related to dosing outside of the 
allowable window (± 1 hour) will be documented in the subject’s medical record.  The study 
center will counsel all subjects with dosing window deviations. 
7.5 Blinding 
7.5.1 Blinding measures  
Subject s enrolled in the trial, investigators and their staff involved in protocol procedures or 
data collection analysis will be blinded to the identity of the treatment sequence. The study monitor will conduct product accountability during and after database lock. To preserve the 
blinding, all investigational products will be over encapsulated and prepackaged accordin g to 
the randomization schedule. 
7.5.2 Unblinding  
In the case of a medical emergency, such as serious adverse events (SAE), breaking the blind 
may become necessary during the trial.  Randomization code- break envelopes are securely 
maintained at the tr ial site and with the Sponsor. 
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a SUSAR related to the blinded treatmen t, the subject ’s treatment code will usually be unblinded before reporting to the health 
authorities, ethic committees and investigators (see Section 9.6.1.4).  
7.5.3 Eme rgency unblinding by the investigator 
The investigator will be provided code-break envelopes that can be used to break the blinding of the study drug.  Any subject  who was unblinded using the code-break envelopes must have 
the occurrence documented in the subject’s medical record.  The investigator should notify 
the sponsor or sponsor medical monitor  prior to unblinding if at all possible unless a delay in 
doing so will deleteriously affect the subject ’s well being. The investigator must report the

Supplement: Version 9 blind break in conjunction with a SAE as defined in Section 9.6.1.  Subject s that have been 
unblinded will not be included in the ITT or PP  efficacy analysis.  
The Sponsor will collect all code -break envelopes at the end of the study. 
7.6 Drug logistics and accountability - amend ment 1 
The Sponsor will provide sufficient quantity of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) to 
the study site.  All study center s will dispense I MP according to the computer generated 
randomization schedule. 
All study drug s will be stored at the investigational site in accordance with GCP requirements 
and the instructions given by the clinical supplies department of the sponsor (or its 
affiliate/CR O), and will be inaccessible to unauthorized personnel. Special storage conditions 
and a complete record of batch numbers and expiry dates can be found in the Sponsor’s study file; the site -relevant elements of this information will be available in the investigator site file. 
On the day of receipt, the responsible site personnel will confirm receipt of study investigational products in writing. The personnel will use the study investigational products only within the framework of this clinical study and in accordance with this protocol. Receipt, distribution, return and destruction (if any) of the study drug must be properly documented according to the sponsor’s agreed and specified procedures. 
7.7 Treatment compliance  
The distribution  of the study medication wi ll be supervised by a member of the Investigator’s 
team. Subjects not at the study center will administer  IMP at their pre-determined dose time .  
Dosing performed at the study center will be monitored by the study staff.  The study center 
will monitor used  and unused IMP for compliance.  Any discrepancies between actual and 
expected amount of returned study medication must be discussed with the subject  at the time 
of the visit, and any explanation must be documented in the source records.

8.1 Prior and concomitant therapy - amendment 1  
 
The following treatments are prohibited:  
• Use of any pain medications  from the start of the Screening Washout Phase 
through trial completion, other than IMP provided by the Sponsor  and rescue pain 
medication provided by the study site  This includes medications such as 
gabapentin, cannabidiol etc. if prescribed to the subject for the purpose of pain control; 
• Taking more than one antidepressant. Subjects who are on a stable dose of one 
antidepressant , for at least 1 month, are eligible for enrollment;  
• Taking more than one anxiolytic medication. Subjects who are on a stable regimen 
of one anxiolytic for at least 1 month, are eligible for enrollment;  
• Fish oil (supplements are permitted if the dose is stable for at least 4 weeks).  
From 4 days prior to randomization until the completion of the Treatment Phase ( Treatment 
Period 4 of 4), subjects are not allowed to take pain treatments (including supplements and/or topicals) other than the provided trial treatment  (IMP and rescue therapy ).  Prohibited 
treatements include:  
• Topical capsaicin, NSAID s, lidocaine, and cannabidiol oil; 
• Glucosamine-chondroitin and turmeric (curcumin);  
• Supplements intended for pain relief.  
If the subject uses an excluded/prohibited medication (analgesic or other medication) after 
being enrolled into the study, the investigator will use his /her judgement to determine  
whether t he subject is able to continue however, the subject must be discontinued if safety is 
concerned.  In other cases, the s ubject may be able to continue if the concomitant medication 
is for short term use and/or is not likely to conflict with the study objectives in subsequent Treatment Periods. 
All medications (prescription and nonprescription products, vitamin and herbal products) taken by the subject from 30 days prior to Screening to End of Study (Follow up phone call ) 
will be documented.  The reported medications will be reviewed and evaluated by the Principal Investigator or designee to determine if they affect the subject’s eligibility to participate in the study.  
8.2 Post-study therapy  
This a blinded four period, four treatment  crossover study for subject s with knee pain due to 
OA and there fore no additional treatment after the 4th treatment period (treatment period 4 of 
4) will be allocated.  Subjects will be discharged upon the ir completion of Follow up phone

To qualify for randomization (Day 1), subjects must have an average score ≥3.0 on the 48-hour WOMAC pain subscale AND/ OR score ≥3.0 on the 24- hour Average Pain Intensity 
Scale.  
 The Principal Investigator or his/her designee must review all screening results before proceeding to the Baseline phase of the study.  This includes the radiographic interpretation of the knee radiographs using the Kellgren and Lawrence scale as well as safety laboratory 
values .  Subjects will be reminded once screening criteria have been met, to discontinue use 
of all pain medications , including topicals, and supplements until they return for Visit 2.  
Subjects can take acetaminophen (up to 2000 mg/day), for knee pain but not within 24 hours of the Randomization visit. The rescue therapy  will be provided by the study site.  Subjects 
will record a diary en try with the day and time of each dose of rescue analgesic used.  
 An external centralized vendor chosen by the sponsor will read/ interpret the knee radiographs and communicate the findings to the study center.  Subjects that do not meet qualification after leaving the test site at Visit 1, will not be required to return their paper diary.  
 
9.2.2 Screening Washout Phase (Day -4 to Day -1 +3 days) 
Eligible subjects will abstain from taking any pain medications , including topicals, and 
supplements during the Screen ing Washout P hase, except acetaminophen as noted below.  
This is necessary so that subjects can accurately document their untreated baseline pain and stiffness prior to treatment randomization. If needed, subjects can take acetaminophen (up to

therapy  is not allowed  24 hours prior to Day 1 pre- treatment assessments and it is not allowed 
from Day 1 through Day 4 assessments of each Treatment Period.  
 The amount of rescue therapy  dispensed will be recorded.  Subjects will record the amount 
and date and time of a ll rescue therapy  doses used in their diary.  At the start of all Treatment 
Periods, subjects will return all unused rescue therapy  and the study center will account for 
the amount used against the subject’s record.  Subject s will be queried in a nonspecif ic fashion for any adverse events  (e.g., “Have you had 
any changes in health?”).  Any reported AEs will be collected and recorded on the CRF/e -
CRF data collection system.   The information recorded will be based on signs and symptoms 
reported by the subject or observed by the research coordinator during the clinical evaluation.

9.6.1 Adverse events  
9.6.1.1  Definitions 
Definition of adverse event (AE)  
In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e.  any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a subject or 
clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study.  Therefore, an AE may or may not be t emporally or causally associated with the use of 
a medicinal (investigational) product.   
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by any physician treating the subject  should not be recorded as an AE (however, the condition for which the surgery is 
required may be an AE).  
In the following differentiation between medical history and AEs, the term “condition” may include abnormal e.g., physical examinati on findings, symptoms, diseases. 
• Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms or treatment are present until signing of informed consent are recorded as medical 
history (e.g., seasonal al lergy without acute complaints); 
• Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , are 
recorded as medical history  (e.g., allergic pollinosis) ; 
• Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as adverse events .  This includes intercurrent illnesses.  
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)  
An SAE  is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any of the 
following criteria (a  – f): 
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the subject  
was at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it we re more severe.

Final Version 3.0 / 11-Sep-2018  
  
 
Reference Number: BHC- RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 9 c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization will not be regarded as an SAE if 
at least one of the following exceptions is met: 
- The admission results in a hospital stay of less than 12 hours 
- The admission is pre-planned  
(e.g., elective or sched uled surgery arranged prior to the start of the study ; 
admission is part of the study procedures as described in Section  9.2) 
- The admission is not associated with an AE  
(e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care). 
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospitalization may fulfill the criterion of ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory authorities specifically require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity  
Disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s 
functions.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect  
f. Is another serious or important medical event as ju dged by the investigator 
9.6.1.2  Classifications for adverse event assessment 
All AEs will be assessed and documented by the investigator according to the categories detailed below.   
9.6.1.2.1  Seriousness 
For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to the cri teria given in 
Section  9.6.1.1. 
 Clinical Study Protocol 19783 Page 40 of 89  
Final Version 3.0 / 11-Sep-2018  
  
 
Reference Number: BHC- RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 9 9.6.1.2.2  Intensity 
The intensity of an AE is classified according to the following categories: 
• Mild : Presents with signs and symptoms easily tolerated, does not need treatment, or 
prolonged hospitalization and does not necessarily require stopping the drug; 
• Moderate:  A type of adverse event that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant; 
• Severe: A type of adverse event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status. The event 
possesses a significant risk of harm to the research participant and hospitalization may be 
required. 
9.6.1.2.3  Causal relationship  
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment is a decision to be made by the investigator, who is a qualified physician, based on all 
information available at the time  of the completion of the CRF/eCRF  data collection system . 
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to the study treatment in question.  
Possible answers are “yes” or “no”  
An assessment of “no” would include: 
1. The existence of a highly likely  alternative explanation, e.g., mechanical bleedin g at 
surgical site.  
or 
2. Non-plausibility, e.g., the subject  is struck by an automobile when there is no 
indication that the drug caused disorientation that may have caused the event; cancer developing a few days after the first drug administration. 
An as sessment of “yes” indicates that that the AE is reasonably associated with the use of the 
study treatment.  
Important factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment include: 
- The temporal sequence from drug administration:  The event should occur after the drug is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
- Recovery on drug discontinuation (de- challenge), recurrence on drug re-introduction 
(re-challenge):   Subject ’s response after de -challenge or re -challenge should be 
considered in view of the usual clinical course of the event in question. 
- Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:   Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject  may have.  
- Concomitant medication or treatment:  
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might have caused the event in question.

Reference Number: BHC- RD-OI-107 
Supplement: Version 9 - Known response pattern for this class of drug: Clinical/preclinical 
- Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses: The exposure to stress might induce adverse 
changes in the recipient and provide a logical and better explanation for the event 
- The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study treatment:  The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the study trea tment, coupled with the individual subject ’s pharmacodynamics should be 
considered. 
- The assessment is not possible 
Causal relationship to protocol- required procedure(s)  
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol-required procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to protocol-required procedure(s). 
Possible answers are “yes” or “no”  
9.6.1.2.4  Action taken with study treatment  
Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories listed below.  
The study treatment action should be recorded separately for each study treatment as detailed in the CRF/eCRF  data collection system . 
- Drug withdrawn  
- Drug interrupted  
- Dose reduced  
- Dose not changed

9.6.1.3  Assessments and documentation of adverse events 
AEs observed, mentioned upon open questioning by a member of the investigator’s team or 
spontaneously reported by the subject will be documented. The observation phase for AEs 
will start with signing the informed consent form and will end in general with the last visit of follow-up. After the end of follow- up there is no requirement to actively collect AEs.  
In case of ongoing AEs after the last follow -up visit – especially when related to treatment 
with the study medication – the respective AE will be followed until resolution, if possible. 
The type of information that should be assessed and recorded by the investigator for each AE is listed in Section  9.6.1.2. 
For all SAEs the sponsor has to carry out a separate assessment for expectedness, seriousness and causal relationship to treatment with the study medication.  
The investigator has to record on the respective CRF/eCRF  data collection system all adverse 
events occurring in the period between the signing of the informed consent and the end of the Follow-up Visit, there is no requirement to actively collect AEs including deaths.  The type of information that should be assessed and recorded by the investigator for each AE is listed in Section  9.6.1.2.   
“Death” should not be recorded as an AE on the AE page.  Instead, “death” is the outcome of 
underlying AE(s).  
For all serious adverse events (SAEs) the sponsor has to carry out a separate assessment for expectedness, seriousness and causal relationship to study dr ug. 
9.6.1.4  Reporting of serious  adverse events and pregnancy  
The definition of serious adverse events (SAEs) is given in Section 9.6.1.1.  Each SAE must be followed up until resolution or stabilization by submission of updated reports to the designated recipient.  
Investigator’s notification of the sponsor 
All investigators will be thoroughly instructed and trained on all relevant aspects of the 
investigator’s reporting obligations for SAEs.  This information, including all relevant contact details, is summarized in the investigator site file.  This information will be updated as needed.  
The investigator must report immediately (within 24  hours of the investigator’s awareness) a ll 
SAEs occurring during the observation period defined in Section 9.6.1.3 to the recipient

Qualitative Interview  – amended  
 Mixed -methods research, which combines quantitative methods with qualitative methods, is 
becoming more common in all areas of human subjects research, including clinical trials.( 14,15,16)  Quantitative research, in which subjects answer questions on fixed forms, is 
limited by the imagination and a ssumptions of the researchers.  Patients often have helpful 
observations about their experiences that may trigger hypotheses about the medications being studied, the assessments used in the study, and the patient experience with logistical and other aspect s of study conduct that may improve subsequent clinical trials.  Therefore this study 
will include a semi- structured interview to provide subjects the opportunity to share their 
perspectives on these issues with investigators.  The qualitative interview will be conducted 
after Visit 3 of Treatment Period 4  of 4 (during the follow up phone call)  or if the subject is 
withdrawn prior to study completion.  
Accelerometer Data Collection  (new for amendment 1) 
 Subjects will wear an accelerometer on their lower leg during each Treatment Period of the  
Treatment Phase.  The accelerometer ) will measure physical activity 
level outcomes captured during Days 1 (partial), 2 and 3 of the Treatment Phase. 
 
Subjects will wear the accelerometer on the lower leg area ( ankle) for each Treatment Period  
without removal except when showering or bathing. The accelerometer cannot be used in conjunction with any swimming or watersport activity.  The accelerometer may be removed 
for sleep. The subject may request to use the opposite ankle for placement of the accelerometer during the trial.

10.3.5  Safety and Tolerability 
AEs will be collected from screening throughout the Treatment Phase and Follow-up Phase 
and will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Only treatment-emergent AEs will be included, i.e., AEs that begin or worsen after the first dose of the investigational medicinal product ( IMP) in the Treatment Phase.  The number and percent of 
subject s who experience any event and the number of events overall, by System Organ Class, 
and by Preferred Term will be displayed by treatm ent period and treatment group.  Tables will 
also be produced by severity and relationship to each IMP. Seriousness, severity, relationship to each IMP duration, and outcome will also be listed. 
Quantitative data for blood pressure, heart rate will be described by summary statistics for the 
original data as well as f or the differences to baseline.  Frequency tables will be provided for 
qualitative data. Laboratory data outside the reference range will be listed and highlighted 
with ‘L’ for low and ‘H’ for high. An additional table with all abnormal values will be presented.  
Listings of individua l subject  data (e.g., vital signs) will be provided.  
10.4 Determination of sample size 
Because there are no reference data on the impact of naproxen, acetaminophen and placebo on stiffness with the utilization of the BASS scale, an estimated 50 subjects randomized to 
achieve approximately 40 subjects completing the study are considered adequate for this pilot 
study.   Screening will continue until 50 subjects are randomized in the study. 
10.5 Planned interim analyses 
No interim analysis is planned for this study.

15.2 Amendment 1 (13 -Apr-2018) 
15.2.1  Overview of changes to the study 
The protocol was amended from version 1.0 to include the use of accelerometers.  These 
devices will be worn by  each subject starting at the conclusion of Visit 2 (Day 1) after 8  hours 
of study procedures and for all awake times for Days 2 and 3 of the Treatment Phase.  The 
data from the accelerometer will be downloaded at the completion of each Visit 3.  The 
purpose is to collect data regarding activity levels in a treatment scenario that could be used to further investigate in future studies with naproxen.  Additional changes to the protocol are 
moving the Qualitative Interview from Visit 3 of Treatment Period  4 to the follow up phone 
call or if the subject withdraw s from the study prior to completing Visit 3 of Treatment Period 
4.  Safety labs were added to the Screening Visit.   Other changes constituted text changes to 
clarify  inclusion/ exclusion criteria , prohibited medications as well as minor text changes in 
other sections of the protocol.

Qualitative Interview  
The qualitative interview will consist of a series of open -ended questions administered by a 
trained interviewer in one-on- one interviews with study subjects during the follow up phone 
call at the conclusion of Treatment 4 of 4or if withdrawn prior to comp letion . The primary 
purpose of the qualitative interview is to provide additional data to augment the quantitative 
data collected from instruments such as the BASS, WOMAC, and NRS.   
The qualitative interview will take approximately 30 -60 minutes to comple te, and will consist 
of 15-20 approximately 30 questions designed to collect information about: 1) subjects’ 
experiences on the study treatments, to determine if there are any advantages of naproxen sodium (Aleve) that were not discovered using the quantit ative instruments; 2) subjects’ 
experiences with the STEPP, to determine if the procedure can be optimized to elicit OA pain and stiffness to a greater degree, which would increase assay sensitivity in trials of new treatments for pain due to OA of the knee; and, 3) subjects’ perspectives on factors to optimize recruitment and retention in future OA studies conducted by Bayer.

Qualitative Interview  - amendment 1  
 
The qualitative interview will consist of a series of open -ended questions administered by a 
trained interviewer in one-on-one int erviews with study subjects  during the follow up phone 
call or if withdrawn prior to completion. The primary purpose of the qualitative interview is to 
provide additional data to augment the quantitative data collected from instruments such as 
the BASS, WO MAC, and NRS.  It is anticipated that subjects will provide additional details 
not revealed through the quantitative instruments used to assess pain and stiffness, such as 
their perception regarding the clinical trial experience ( e.g., pros and cons), addi tional details 
about the impact of each treatment on their daily function and quality of life, and information 
that may be useful to optimize the STEPP for inducing experimental pain in clinical studies.  
 
The qualitative interview will take approximately 3 0-60 minutes to complete, and will consist 
of approximately 30 questions designed to collect information about: 1) subjects’ experiences 
on the study treatments, to determine if there are any advantages of naproxen sodium (Aleve) 
that were not discovered u sing the quantitative instruments; 2) subjects’ experiences with the 
STEPP, to determine if the procedure can be optimized to elicit OA pain and stiffness to a greater degree, which would increase assay sensitivity in trials of new treatments for pain due to OA of the knee; and, 3) subjects’ perspectives on factors to optimize recruitment and retention in future OA studies conducted by Bayer.  Audio from each interview will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative data analysis software   The specific procedures 
related to interviewer training, interview script, audio data collection, data analysis and 
reporting of results will be documented separately outside of the protocol.

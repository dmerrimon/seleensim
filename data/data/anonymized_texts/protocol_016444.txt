Purpose of the Study  
Implement a  RCT to test the main hypothesis that the use of personalized decision aids leads to (i) an 
increase in the proportion of women who would consider active surveillance as a viable management 
strategy for DCIS , and (ii) an increase in knowledge of the associ ated risk trade -offs.  
 
The central hypothesis is that communication of model -based personalized risk projections leads to an 
improved understanding of the trade -offs associated with different management strategies for DCIS . 
 
Background & Significance  
Overtreatment in Breast Carcinoma in Situ ( DCIS ). Each year in the United States alone, 
approximately 60,000 women will be diagnosed with DCIS  (10). More than 97% of diagnosed women will 
choose immediate treatment, either surgery alone, or surgery in combi nation with radiation or 
chemotherapy (11). Since it is estimated that only 20 -30% of DCIS  lesions eventually become invasive 
(12, 13), this year, as many as 45,000 women will undergo radical surgery for a lesion that would not 
cause any harm in their rema ining lifetime. The treatments, and thus the consequences of current DCIS  
management, are similar to those of treatment for invasive cancers. Consequences include pain (14 -16), 
reduced quality of life (17, 18), increased risk of angiosarcoma and ischemic c ardiac disease (due to 
radiation) (19, 20).  
 
Scientific Premise for Active Surveillance in DCIS . The concept of AS was introduced to manage 
prostate cancer, because many men die with their prostate cancer, rather than from it, and treatment 
can be associat ed with profound morbidity. In AS, definitive therapy is not implemented at diagnosis. 
Instead, decisions about whether and when to intervene are based on subsequent disease behavior 
during surveillance over time (21). The AS approach allows the biologic b ehavior of a monitored tumor 
to dictate therapy, thus effectively reducing overtreatment by reserving aggressive interventions only 
for those likely to derive benefit from them. Because it is a non -invasive lesion with unknown 
malignancy potential, DCIS  is comparable to early -stage prostate cancers for which AS is effective. 
However, currently only 3% of patients diagnosed with DCIS  elect AS (22). Retrospective studies suggest 
that surgery may not improve survival for low -grade DCIS  (23); however, prospecti ve data remain 
scarce.  
 
Empowering Patients through Personalized Decision Aids (DA).  In the absence of prospective 
data for AS in patients with DCIS , the current paradigm of surgical treatment is unlikely to change in the 
near future. Since randomized cont rolled trials (RCTs) on AS have only recently started (7 -9), relevant 
data is a long way off. At the same time, there is a great wealth of existing clinical and biological data on 
DCIS . However, because these resources are dispersed across a large number o f data and knowledge 
sources, they remain largely inaccessible to patients and their physicians. To overcome this information 
barrier, the proposed research is expected to yield the best -possible individualized risk and uncertainty 
projections for patients  diagnosed with DCIS , and to effectively communicate these projections via 
personalized DAs. This contribution is significant because it is expected to enable future DCIS  patients to 
evaluate the trade -offs associated with different management strategies, and to make an informed 
decision that is aligned with their personal risk tolerance. By increasing the acceptability of AS through 
effective communication of personalized risks, the proposed research has a significant impact on the 
NIH’s mission to reduce morbidity and enhance health.  
 
Design & Procedures  
Implement an RCT to test the main hypothesis that the use of personalized decision aids leads to (i) an 
increase in the proportion of women who would consider active surveillance as a viable management 
strategy for DCIS , and (ii) an increase in knowledge o f the associated risk trade -offs. The consents and 
associated documents will be uploaded for review and approval before recruitment/consent.  
 
Introduction . The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the DA on the understanding and 
acceptabili ty of AS. For ethical reasons, we will test the main hypothesis in a hypothetical scenario in 
women without a personal history of cancer. The rationale for this aim is that, if successful in women 
with no personal history of cancer, we will advance towards  the long -term goal of reducing 
overtreatment of DCIS . This aim will be informed by both the cognitive interviews (Aim R2a) and DA pre -
testing (Aim R2c). All documents that will be used during this aim will be uploaded to this application 
once they are dev eloped. We will submit modifications before beginning any data collection. Materials 
and consent documents will be developed for both the 202 participants for the RCT as well as for the 
beta -testing portion. All documents will be uploaded to the IRB once t hey are developed. No 
participants will be recruited/consented until an amendment is reviewed and approved by the IRB.  
 
Justification & Feasibility . Because there is no clear distinction between attitude and choice in a 
hypothetical scenario, the commonly used evaluation measure of informed choice (39, 48) is unsuitable. 
We focus instead on the proportion of women who would choose AS as their preferred treatment 
option. Our working hypothesis is that the personalized DA will increase this proportion, becaus e DCIS -
specific mortality under AS is comparable to early -stage prostate cancer -specific mortality under AS (49), 
and 35 -50% of men diagnosed with early -stage prostate cancer choose AS (50 -52). Thus, it is plausible 
that AS could be considered a viable opt ion for DCIS  if the trade -offs for different management 
strategies are effectively communicated. Similar to previous DA evaluations (40, 53), we will use an RCT 
design. Since many women are unaware of AS in breast cancer (54), the control arm plays a cruci al role 
by accounting for potential novelty priming.  
 
Research Design . A parallel -arm double -blind RCT of 202 women to evaluate DST (decision support 
tool) with AS as an option (intervention) vs. DST without AS as  an option (control) for a hypothetical 
diagnosis with low -grade DCIS . The primary outcome is treatment choice (binary: AS vs non -AS). 
Secondary outcomes include: acceptability of the different treatment options; perceived riskiness of the 
AS option, and p re- vs post -knowledge about DCIS (self -reported). Using the secure web portal REDCap, 
eligible consented women will complete three phases: randomization, baseline, and 
endline.  Randomization phase:  1:1 randomization to control (surgery options only) or int ervention 
(surgery options plus active surveillance option) arms, stratified by age group (< 65, 65+) to ensure 
balance of age -specific mortality risks. Block randomization (k=6) will be used.  Baseline phase:  all 
women will receive information about a hypo thetical DCIS  diagnosis and complete: 1) a baseline 
questionnaire about breast cancer and DCIS  knowledge.  Endline phase:  after self -directed exploration of 
provided content, primary and secondary outcomes will be measured by questionnaire. A series of 
addi tional covariates and personality scales will also be elicited with the questionnaire. Each woman is 
expected to take at most one hour to complete the entire study task. In addition to the questionnaire, 
the team will collect basic website user analytics s uch as the order in which the website is explored, and 
how long participants spend on each page.  Eligibility.  Consented female participants of age 50 -79 years, 
with no history of breast cancer and with a negative mammographic screen within the preceding 12  
months. A financial incentive will be provided.  Beta -testing.  Before roll -out of the RCT, beta -testing of 
the evaluation will be conducted in 30 women (15 in each trial arm).  
 
Expected Outcomes . An RCT -validated DA that improves understanding of the trade -offs associated 
with different management strategies for DCIS , and that increases acceptability of AS as a viable 
management strategy.  
 
Rigor and Transparency . Rigor in DA evaluation is achieved by using a parallel -arm, double -blind 
randomized controlled trial design. Highest possible robustness and transparency of the approach will 
be achieved by registering the trial with clinicaltrials.gov and adhering to CONSORT guidelines for 
analysis.  
 
Potential Problems & Alternative Approaches . Our working hypothes is is that the use of a 
personalized DA will increase the proportion of women who consider AS a viable management strategy 
for DCIS . Although our model projections (60) solidly support this hypothesis, it may not be confirmed 
here. In this unlikely case, we will analyze secondary outcomes and baseline risk measures to determine 
whether the lack of effect was due to poor understanding of DA content or was associated with low 
personal risk tolerance. Because the DA provides projections for all management mod alities, it remains 
valuable even for women who are opposed to AS.  
 
Selection of Subjects  
Sex: Female  
Age: 50 -79 years  
Has had a negative mammographic screen in the past 12 months  
No personal history of breast cancer  
Subject Recruitment and Compensation  
For beta -testing (n=30) and the full randomized study (n=202), a total of 232 women will be recruited 
from the Duke Mammography Clinic. We will use a MaestroCare MyChart recruitment invitation to help 
identify potential participants. Potential subjects are i dentified via a report generated within 
MaestroCare by the DOCR MaestroCare Analyst team. A recruitment invitation will be sent by a DOCR 
analyst to potential subjects via MyChart. The patient will indicate if they are interested and the study 
coordinator will be sent an Inbasket message (MaestroCare internal message) if they are interested. 
Only key personnel who are delegated the task of patient identification/recruitment will have access to 
the Inbasket messages. Only patients who express interest will b e contacted by key personnel, who will 
then follow the recruitment process approved by the IRB for this study. The study coordinator may 
follow -up (up to 3 times) with patients (by phone, email, or via MyChart message) if they expressed 
initial interest in  the study. Patients who have opted out of research contact, via yellow dot in Maestro, 
will not be contacted. Patients will not be contacted more than three times, including via phone and 
email. If a patient states they would like to opt out, the study te am will follow the Duke Recruitment and 
Engagement policy.  
 
RCT beta -testing and randomized study compensation: $25/survey  
Subject’s Capacity to Give Legally Effective Consent  
Not applicable, only subjects capable of giving consent themselves will be eligi ble for inclusion in the 
study.  
Risk/Benefit Assessment  
The potential risks to RCT participants (Aim R3) include accidental disclosure of their identity or 
identifiable responses. This would result in the disclosure of the participant’s identity, their opi nion 
about the utility of the decision aid for communicating risk, and the self -reported effect of decision aid 
material on their perceived acceptability of active surveillance as a management strategy for DCIS . 
Because the participants have had a negative  mammogram within the past 12 months and have no 
personal history of breast cancer, the risks of psychological harms by engaging with the decision aid 
content is expected to be minimal. Because there are few anticipated risks, in our opinion, the benefits 
driven from the causally strong conclusions of the trial outweigh the very minimal risks to the 
participants.  
 
Only self -reported participant data and basic demographics will be collected for this study. The planned 
procedures for protecting against and mi nimizing potential risks include: use of a secure system for data 
collection; storage of data in a secure relational database requiring two -factor authentication.  
 
Benefits : 
Potential direct benefits of the research to research participants include intellectual satisfaction in 
participating in the pre -testing of a decision aid for breast cancer patients, and the satisfaction of 
contributing to the advancement of knowledge about decision aid development for breast cancer 
patients. The benefits to canc er care and society include the potential to generate new knowledge 
about informed decision making, and the potential for this work to steer future research in the 
management of breast carcinoma in situ. The minimal risks to subjects are considered reasona ble in 
relation to the anticipated benefits to research participants and society overall.  
Costs to the Subject  
There are no costs that the subject will incur as a result of participation  
Data Safety and Monitoring  
The DA will be evaluated in women without a personal history of breast cancer. Participants will be 
presented with a hypothetical DCIS  diagnosis scenario only, and the study does not involve medicinal 
products or medical devices. Furthermore, the DA will b e developed following best practice guidelines 
from the Society of Medical Decision Making and with input from an expert in the user experience 
design industry. Most importantly, we will seek to minimize potential psychological risks to participants 
in the  study. Based on these considerations, we anticipate minimal risks to the participants and very low 
risk of (serious) adverse events. In the case of an adverse event, however, it will be reported in 
accordance with Duke IRB guidelines.

Page 1Survey: Decision support website
In this survey, we will ask you to explore a decision support website.
 
The website is designed for patients diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (abbreviated as DCIS). It is okay if you
have never heard of DCIS before. The website will provide plenty of information about it.
 
After exploring the website, you will be asked to answer questions about your experience and what you learned.
2 One quick note before you get started: Please be sure you are on a laptop or desktop computer (not a tablet or
phone), using one of the browsers listed below. Microsoft Explorer is not supported.

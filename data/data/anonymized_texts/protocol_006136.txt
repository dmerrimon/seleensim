Name of Sponsor Company: 
Kowa Research Institute, Inc.  Drug Under Study: K-877 
Title of Protocol: A Phase 3, Multi-Center, Placebo- Controlled, Randomized, Double-B lind, 12-Week Study With a 
40-Week, Active-Controlled, Open-Label Extension to  Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of K-877 in 
Adult Patients With Fasting Triglyceride Levels ≥500 mg/dL and <2000 mg/dL and Mild or Moderate 
Renal Impairment 
Protocol Number: K-877-303 Phase: 3 Indication:  
Dyslipidemia 
Study Design: Study K-877-303 is a Phase 3, multi- center, randomized study to confir m the efficacy and safety of K-877 
0.2 mg twice daily compared to matching placebo (i n the double-blind 12-week Efficacy Period) and an 
active comparator, fenofibrate (in the open-label 40-w eek Extension Period), in patients with fasting 
triglyceride (TG) levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and <2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) and mild or 
moderate renal impairment (estimated  glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m
2 and 
<90 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Eligible patients will enter a 4- to 6-week lifestyl e stabilization period (4-week stabilization for patients 
not requiring washout and 6-week washout and stabilization for patients on lipid-altering therapy other 
than statins, ezetimibe, or propro tein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors). The 
stabilization period will be followed by a 2-week TG qualifying period (Visits 2 [Week -2] and 
3 [Week -1]), and patient eligibility will be assessed based on the mean TG value from these 2 visits. If the patient’s mean TG level during the TG qualifying period is ≥450 mg/dL (5.09 mmol/L) and 
<500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L), an additional TG measurement can be taken 1 week later at Visit 3.1. The 
mean of all 3 TG measurements will be used to determine eligibility for the study. After confirmation of 
qualifying fasting TG values, eligib le patients will enter a 12-week, randomized, double-blind Efficacy 
Period. At Visit 4 (Day 1), patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to K-877 0.2 mg twice daily 
or identical matching placebo tablets twice daily. During the 12-week Efficacy Period, patients will return to the site at Visit 5 (Week 4) , Visit 6 (Week 8), and Visit 7 (Week 12) for efficacy and safety 
evaluations. 
Patients who successfully complete th e 12-week Efficacy Period are eligib le to continue in a 40-week, 
open-label, active-controlled Extension Period af ter completing the Visit 7 (Week 12) procedures. 
Patients randomized to receive K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in the 12-week Efficacy Period will continue to receive K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in  the 40-week Extension Period. Patients randomized to receive 
placebo matching K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in the 12-week Efficacy Period will initiate fenofibrate 
dosing at 48 mg once daily at Visit 7 (Week 12). Starting from Visit 8 (Week 16), Investigators can adjust fenofibrate dosing (to 145 mg once daily) at their di scretion according to the local standard of care. 
From Visit 7 (Week 12), patients not on statins, ezetim ibe, or PCSK9 inhibitors may initiate therapy, and 
patients receiving statins, ezetimibe, or PCSK9 inhibito rs may alter their dose, as indicated by guidelines 
or local standard of care. 
After Visit 8 (Week 16), patients are to return to th e site every 12 weeks until the last visit (Visit 11 
[Week 52]). 
Primary Objective: 
The primary objective of the study is to demonstrat e the efficacy of K-877 0.2 mg twice daily compared 
to placebo from baseline to Week 12 in lowering fasting TG levels in patients with fasting TG levels 
≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and <2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) and mild or moderate renal impairment.

Statistical Analysis: 
Efficacy: 
In order to control the family-wise Type I error at a 0.05 level, a fixed sequential testing procedure will be 
implemented. In a hierarchical step-down manner, the primary endpoint will be tested first, followed by 
secondary endpoints, tested in the following hierarchical manner: percent change from baseline to 
Week 12 in a fixed sequence of (1) re mnant cholesterol ( calculated as TC − LDL-C − HDL-C), 
(2) HDL-C, (3) Apo A1, and (4) non-HDL-C. Each test is planned to be performed at a 0.05 significance 
level. Inferential conclusions about these efficacy endpoints will require statis tical significance of the 
previous one. 
For other efficacy endpoints, nominal p-values and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) will be presented, but 
should not be considered as confirmatory. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on H odges-Lehmann estimator with  pattern-mixture model 
imputation based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The pattern-mixture model will be used as the primary 
imputation method as part of the primary analysis for the percent change in fasting TGs from baseline to Week 12. This imputation model will include factors such as patient demographics, disease status, and baseline TG, as well as adherence to therapy. Th e imputation model will impute missing Week 12 TG 
values as follows: 
• For patients who do not adhere to therapy and who do not have a Week 12 measurement, the missing data imputation method will use patients in the same treatment arm who do not adhere to 
therapy and have a Week 12 measurement; and  
• If there are no patients in the same treatment arm who do not adhere to therapy and have a 
Week 12 measurement, missing Week 12 TG values will be imputed as follows: 
o For the K-877 arm, the treatment effect is considered wa shed out and baseline TG values 
will be used to impute the Week 12 TG values; and  
o For the placebo arm, missing Week 12 TG va lues will be imputed assuming missing at 
random, including patient demographics, disease status, and baseline and post-baseline efficacy data from the placebo arm.  
After the multiple imputation step, each imputed dataset will be analyzed by the nonparametric 
Hodges-Lehmann method and the Hodges-Lehmann estimator and standard error will be combined to 
produce treatment difference estimate and 95% CI and p-value.

K-877-303, Study Protocol  K-877 
 
13 Sep 2016 v1.0  xi 11  The primary efficacy analysis will be repeated on the Per-Protocol Set. 
Summary statistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, 
25th percentile, and 75th percentile) at baseline, each scheduled visit, and change and percent change in 
fasting TG from baseline to each scheduled visit will be provided. 
Secondary efficacy endpoint s included in the hierarchical step-d own testing procedure include percent 
change from baseline to Week 12 in a fixed sequen ce of (1) remnant cholesterol, (2) HDL-C, (3) Apo A1, 
and (4) non-HDL-C. The secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints du ring the 12-week Efficacy Period will be analyzed 
using an ANCOVA model with the same imputation method used for the primary analysis. The 
ANCOVA model will include country, current statin th erapy use (not on statin therapy versus currently 
receiving statin therapy), and treat ment as factors; baseline value as a covariate. If the normality 
assumption is not met, the Hodges-Lehmann estimator  with the same imputation method used for the 
primary analysis will be used. 
The secondary efficacy endp oint of percent change in fasting TG  from baseline to Week 52 will be 
summarized descriptively.  
 Other efficacy end points during the 40-week 
Extension Period will be summarized descriptively. No hypothesis testing will be performed. 
 
 
 
Safety: 
The safety endpoint data will be su mmarized for the Safety  Analysis Set for the 12-week Efficacy Period, 
40-week Extension Period, and overall. 
The AEs will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. A 
general summary of the AEs and serious AEs (SAEs)  will be summarized by overall number of AEs, 
severity, and relationship to study drug per treatment group. The number of AEs leading to withdrawal and SAEs leading to death will also be summarized. The incidence of AEs will be summarized by body system and treatment group. The incidence of treatment-emergent AEs will also be summarized by 
system organ class and preferred term. 
The safety laboratory data will be summarized by vi sit and by treatment group, along with changes from 
the baseline. The values that are below the lower limit or above the upper limit of  the reference range will 
be flagged. Those values or changes in values that are identified as being clinically significant will be flagged. Laboratory abnormalities of special interest, such as liver function tests and pancreatitis events, 
will be summarized. 
Vital signs and 12-lead ECGs will also be summarized  by visit and by treatment group, along with the 
changes from baseline. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
Population PK and PK/PD data will be analyzed and reported separately.

 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE FOR DOSE SELECTION 
1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
K-877 is a potent and selective peroxisome proliferator-activated  receptor (PPAR) 
modulator, which is several thousand times more selective for the PPAR α receptor than 
the PPAR γ or PPAR δ receptor.  
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
1.2 RATIONALE 
A variety of
 primary disorders of lipoprotei n metabolism have been described which may 
lead to elevated levels of the atheroge nic lipoproteins (VLDL, remnant particles, 
LDL, etc.) or reduced levels of the anti-atherogenic high-density lipoprotein, any or all of 
which can confer increased risk of coronary ar tery disease. Of great er concern, elevated 
levels of TG, in particular TG levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L), c onfer an increased risk 
of acute pancreatitis.2,3 Acute pancreatitis caused by hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is 
associated with increased severity and rates of complications compared to pancreatitis with causes other than HTG.

13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 2 of 78 Fibrates improve TG and HDL-C by activating PPAR α,6 and are labeled in the 
United States for the treatment of severe HTG (SHTG). In the United States, fenofibrate, 
fenofibric acid, and gemfibrozil are available. Fi brates available in Europe are bezafibrate, 
ciprofibrate, fenofibrate, and gemfibrozil. In Japan, bezafibrate, clinofibrate, clofibrate, 
and fenofibrate are available.  
The United States Adult Treatment Panel III  National Cholesterol Education Program 
(NCEP) guidelines7 recommend reduction of TG through lifestyle, diet, and 
pharmacologic methods as the first priority of therapy when serum TG are ≥500 mg/dL. 
Treatment with omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in fish oils, has been shown to 
effectively decrease TG levels up to 30%; however, for individuals  with SHTG (serum 
TG ≥500 mg/dL), increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake does not adequately manage 
TG levels.8 
The European Society for Cardiology and Eu ropean Atherosclerosis Society consensus 
guidelines note that patients can develop pa ncreatitis with TG concentrations between 
5 and 10 mmol/L (440 and 880 mg/dL).9 These guidelines also recommend initiating 
fibrates to prevent acute pancreatitis. Most fibrates are contraindicat ed or require careful administ ration in patients with renal 
dysfunction. Furthermore, coadministration of these drugs with statins is contraindicated 
in patients with severe renal dysfunction. Thus, there are restri ctions in the use of existing 
PPARα  agonists.
10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 
K-877 is a selective PPAR α agonist

13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 3 of 78  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Therefore, K-877 is expected to exhibit not onl y a potent lipid 
metabolism-
improving effect but also to serv e as a drug with a broad therapeutic range 
with fewer restrictions in patients with rena l dysfunction or with concomitant drugs than 
existing PPAR α agonists. 
Fenofibrate (48 mg once daily) was chosen as the active comparator for the 40-week 
Extension Period of this study based on current  guidelines for the management of SHTG. 
As per the United States product insert for fe nofibrate, the initial dosage will be 48 mg 
once daily. A higher dose, 145 mg, is also avai lable for patients who will tolerate this 
dose. To facilitate the management of fenofibrate, the 40-week Extension Period will be conducted with open-label study drug. 
Data from study K-877-12 in Japanese pa tients with renal impairment found no 
meaningful differences in K-877 pharmacokinetic s (PK), even in patients with severe 
renal impairment, suggesting adjustment of dosing for renal impairment will not be 
necessary with K-877 to ensure patient safety. 
The present study is a Phase 3 multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, 
double-blind, 12-week study with a 40-wee k, active-controlled, open-label extension 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of K-877 0.2 mg twice daily  in patients with 
fasting TG levels ≥ 500 mg/dL and <2000 mg/dL and mild or moderate renal impairment. 
The results of this study will provide a better understanding of the efficacy and safety of 
K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in  patients with SHTG.

 STUDY DESCRIPTION 
3.1 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized study to confirm the efficacy and safety of 
K-877 0.2 mg twice daily compared to matching placebo (in the double-blind 12-week 
Efficacy Period) and an active comparator, fenofibrate (in the open-label 40-week 
Extension Period), in patients with fasting TG levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and 
<2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) and mild or moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2 and <90 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Eligible patients will enter a 4- to 6-week lifestyle stabilization period (4-week 
stabilization for patients not requiring was hout and 6-week washout  and stabilization for 
patients on lipid-alterin g therapy other than statins, eze timibe, or proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 [PCSK9] inhibitors). The stabilization period will be followed by a 2-week TG qualifying period (V isits 2 [Week -2] and 3 [Week -1]), and patient eligibility 
will be assessed based on the mean TG value fr om these 2 visits. If the patient’s mean TG 
level during the TG qualifying period is ≥450 mg/dL (5.09 mmol/L) and <500 mg/dL 
(5.65 mmol/L), an additional TG measurement can be taken 1 week later at Visit 3.1. The mean of all 3 TG measurements will be used to determine eligibility for the study. After 
confirmation of qualifying fasting TG values, eligible patients will enter a 12-week, 
randomized, double-blind Efficacy Period. At Vis it 4 (Day 1), patients will be randomly 
assigned in a 2:1 ratio to K-877 0.2 mg twice daily or identical matching placebo tablets twice daily. During the 12-week Efficacy Period, patients will return to the site at Visit 5 
(Week 4), Visit 6 (Week 8), and Visit 7 (Week 12) for efficacy and safety evaluations. 
Patients who successfully complete the 12-week  Efficacy Period are eligible to continue 
in a 40-week, open-label, active-controlled Extension Period after completing the Visit 7 
(Week 12) procedures. Patients randomized to  receive K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in the 
12-week Efficacy Period will continue to receive K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in the 
40-week Extension Period. Patients ra ndomized to receive placebo matching 
K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in the 12-week Efficacy  Period will initia te fenofibrate dosing 
at 48 mg once daily at Visit 7 (Week 12). St arting from Visit 8 (Week 16), Investigators 
can adjust fenofibrate dosing (to 145 mg once daily) at their discretion according to the 
local standard of care.  
From Visit 7 (Week 12), patients not on sta tins, ezetimibe, or PCSK9 inhibitors may 
initiate therapy, and patients receiving statin s, ezetimibe, or PCSK9 inhibitors may alter 
their dose, as indicated by guideli nes or local standard of care. 
After Visit 8 (Week 16), patients are to retu rn to the site every 12 weeks until the last 
visit (Visit 11 [Week 52]). Table 2 presents the clinical evaluation  schedule performed during the study.

1. Triglyceride levels are based on the mean of the Visit 2 (Week -2) and Visit 3 (Week -1) values. In cases in which a patient’s mean TG level from Visit 2 (Week -2) and Visi t 3 (Week -1) falls outs ide the required range 
for entry into the study but is ≥450 mg/dL (5.09 mmol/L) and <500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L), an additional TG measurement can be collected 1 week (±3 days) later (Vis it 3.1). If Visit 3.1 is required, the TG qualifying 
period will be extended, and Visit 4 will occur 1 week (±3 days) after Visit 3.1. If a third sample is collected, entry into th e 12-week Efficacy Period is based on the mean of  the values from Visit 2 (Week -2), Visit 3 
(Week -1), and Visit 3.1. 
2. Starting from Visit 8 (Week 16), Investigators can adjust fenofibrate dosing (to 145 mg once daily) at their discretion accordi ng to the local standard of care. 
3. Visit 1 for patients who require a washout is at Week -8. Visit 1 for patients who do not require a washout is at Week -6. 
4. Height is measured at Visit 1 (Week -8 or Week -6) only.

13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 17 of 78 4.3 STUDY DRUG DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA 
It will be necessary to make a distinction between patients who prematurely discontinue 
study drug treatment and those who wit hdraw from the study for any reason.  
If the patient discontinues study drug, the re ason should be captured and could include 
the following: 
1. The patient requests discon tinuation of the study drug; 
2. The patient begins to take any medica tion(s) that is co ntraindicated by the 
protocol; 
3. The patient develops an AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would 
compromise the patient’s safety to continue the study drug; 
4. The patient meets any of the crite ria specified in Section 4.6;  
5. A female patient becomes pregnant during the study; 
6. In the Investigator’s judgment, it is in the patient’s best interests; or 
7. The patient is unblinded during the 12-week Efficacy Period. 
During the 12-week Efficacy Period, patients who discontinue study drug prematurely 
will remain in the study until Visit 7 (Week 12). However, patients who discontinue 
study drug during the 40-week Extension Period  will be required to withdraw from the 
study and requested to complete the full panel of assessments scheduled for the Early Termination (ET) Visit (see Section 4.4 ). If a patient who has discontinued study 
drug fails to attend any follow-up appointment s, reasonable efforts (telephone calls to 
family members or friends, e-mail contacts, et c.) will be made in order to encourage the 
patient to complete the study visits. 
Although a patient is not obligated to give  his/her reason for discontinuing study drug, 
the Investigator will make a reasonable effo rt to obtain the reason while fully respecting 
the patient’s rights. The reason for disconti nuation of study drug must be documented in 
the electronic case report form (eCRF). The Clinical Study Report (C SR) will include the 
reason(s) for discontinuation of study drug. Patients will not be allowed to restart the study drug in the event of discontinuation; 
however, study drug may be restarted in ca ses of study drug in terruption due to 
temporary use of prohibited medication(s). 
4.4 WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA 
The patient has the right to w ithdraw from the study at any time. Nevertheless, in this 
study, every attempt will be made to prevent missing data and to obtain complete 
follow-up of all patients during the 12-week E fficacy Period. Investigators will be trained 
to minimize full withdrawals from the 12-week Efficacy Period wherever possible. 
CONFIDENTIAL  Kowa Research Institute, Inc.  
K-877-303, Study Protocol K-877 
 
 
13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 18 of 78 Patients who discontinue study drug during th e first 12 weeks are not required to 
withdraw from the study. These patients will be encouraged to remain in the study and 
asked to conduct the remaining study visits as outlined in the protocol through Visit 7 
(Week 12). At a minimum, measurements of  lipid parameters at key time points, 
particularly Visit 7 (Week 12), should be ta ken for all study patients, regardless of 
adherence to therapy or study pr otocol. If a patient fails to actively maintain contact with 
the Investigator, reason able efforts (telephone calls to family members or friends, e-mail 
contacts, etc.) will be made in order to enc ourage the patient to complete the study visits. 
If the patient withdraws from the study, the reason should be captured and could include 
the following: 
1. The patient withdraws consen t at any time or requests discontinuation of the study 
drug during the 40-week Extension Period; 
2. The patient begins to take any medicatio n(s) during the 40-week Extension Period 
that is prohibited by the protocol; 
3. The patient develops an AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would 
compromise the patient’s safe ty by continuing in the study; 
4. The patient meets any of the criteria sp ecified in Section 4.6  during the 40-week 
Extension Period; 
5. A female patient becomes pregnant during the study; 
6. The patient fails to comply with pr otocol requirements or study-related 
procedures if, in the opinion of the Investigat or or the Sponsor, the 
non-compliance will significantly compromise data interpretation or safety; 
7. In the Investigator’s judgment, it is in the patient’s best interests; 
8. Violation of the protocol in clusion and exclusion criteria  is discovered, if, in the 
opinion of the Investigator or the S ponsor, the violation will significantly 
compromise data interpretation or safety; or 
9. The Sponsor or the regulatory authority terminates the study. 
Patients who choose to withdraw consent wi ll be asked to document withdrawal of 
consent in writing. 
Although a patient is not obligated to give his/her reason for withdrawing prematurely, 
the Investigator will make a reasonable effo rt to obtain the reason while fully respecting 
the patient’s rights. The reason for withdrawal  from the study must be documented in the 
eCRF. The CSR will include the reason(s) withdrawal from the study. If a patient withdraws prematurely from th e study, study staff will make every effort to 
complete the full panel of assessments scheduled for the ET Visit.  
CONFIDENTIAL  Kowa Research Institute, Inc.  
K-877-303, Study Protocol K-877 
 
 
13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 19 of 78 If a patient withdraws from the study due to an  AE, the patient will be asked to return to 
the site for, at a minimum, the evaluations scheduled for the ET Visit. If the AE has still 
not resolved, additional follow-up will be performed, as appropriate, and documented in the patient’s medical records. As a mi nimum requirement, ongoing AEs are to be 
followed for 30 days after the patient’s last dose of study drug. If patients are lost to 
follow-up, attempts to contact them must be made and documented in the study records. 
Withdrawn patients wi ll not be replaced. 
4.5 RE-SCREENING OF SCREEN FAILURES 
Patients who are screen failures for a modifiable condition (such as elevated HbA
1c or 
uncontrolled hypertension), other than failing the TG criteria, can be re-screened once 
and enrolled in the study at a future date if  they are then deemed eligible for study 
participation based on protocol entry criteri a after having medications adjusted and 
stabilized. Before each patient is re-screene d, the Investigator should discuss the case 
with the Medical Monitor.  
4.6 STUDY DRUG DISCONTINUATIO N FOR PERSISTENT ABNORMAL 
CLINICAL LABORATORY VALUES 
A patient will discontinue treatme nt with study drug if persistent elevations in ALT, AST, 
CK, or TG, or a persistent decrease in eG FR, occur according to the following criteria: 
1. ALT or AST >8 × ULN, confirmed on repeat; 
2. ALT or AST >3 × ULN and bilirubin >2 × ULN or International Normalized 
Ratio (INR) >1.5, confirmed on repeat;  
3. ALT or AST >3 × ULN with the appear ance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fe ver, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%) 
confirmed on repeat; 
4. ALT or AST >5 × ULN which persists for 2 weeks; 
5. Unexplained CK >5 × ULN confirmed on repeat. For patients with 
CK ≥10 × ULN, Investigators should imme diately interrupt study drug while 
awaiting re-evaluation;  
6. Fasting TG levels >2000 mg/dL (22.60 mm ol/L) with signs or symptoms of 
pancreatitis at any time dur ing the study. For repeated or persistent el evations of 
TG >2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) that are not  accompanied by signs or symptoms 
of pancreatitis, Investigators may discontinue study dr ug at their discretion; or 
7. eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 occurring at or after Visi t 7 (Week 12), confirmed on 
repeat for patients who are receiving fenofibrate 48 mg. For patients on fenofibrate 145 mg, Investigators may decr ease the fenofibrate dose and reassess 
the patient.

13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 20 of 78 If at any time during the study a patient devel ops elevations in ALT or AST >3 × ULN, 
CK >5 × ULN, TG >2000 mg/dL (>22.60 mmol/L), or a decrease in 
eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Visit 7 (Week 12) or any su bsequent visit, the study site 
will receive an alert from the central laboratory. 
For further details regarding study drug discont inuation for persistent abnormal clinical 
laboratory tests, see Section 5.2.2.  
4.7 SURVEILLANCE FOR POSSIBLE PANCREATITIS 
Investigators should be vi gilant for potential cases of panc reatitis. If a patient experiences 
abdominal pain or unexplained gastrointes tinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, or 
diarrhea), they should return to  the site for an unscheduled visit as soon as possible. A 
history including symptoms, concomitant medication and dietary and alcohol intake, a 
physical examination, and laboratory evaluation of TG, amylase and lipase, as well as any other evaluations deemed necessary by the Investigator should be performed and 
documented on the appropriate eCRF. Patients who are diagnosed with  pancreatitis; who 
have elevations of amylase or lipase, with  or without symptoms; or who have severe 
abdominal pain, or sustained (>7 days), unexplained abdominal pain, even without 
elevations of amylase or lipase should have their cases submitted for adjudication of pancreatitis.

CONFIDENTIAL  Kowa Research Institute, Inc.  
K-877-303, Study Protocol K-877 
 
 
13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 23 of 78 Repeat evaluation should include AST, ALT, prothrombin time/INR, total bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransfer ase, creatinine, CK, and complete viral 
hepatitis screen. The patient should be que stioned regarding symptoms, as well as 
potential causative factors. This informati on, including results an d normal ranges of any 
laboratory parameters collected at a loca l laboratory, should be collected on the 
appropriate eCRF. Hepatobiliar y ultrasonography and/or consu ltation with a hepatologist 
should be considered if  clinically indicated. 
Abnormal laboratory parameters should be follo wed at least weekly (more frequently as 
clinically indicated) until they have returned to baseline or have stabilized. 
 Creatine Kinase Elevations 
In the event of a CK elevation >5 × ULN, the patient should return to the site within 1 week for evaluation.  
For a CK elevation >10 × ULN, study drug should be interrupted immediately while 
awaiting evaluation.  Evaluation should include the patient being qu estioned about symptoms (e.g., muscle or 
tendinous pain, cramping, or weakness) and potential causes for the CK elevation 
(e.g., medications, exercise, or trauma). The following laboratory measurements should be obtained: CK, CK-MB, CK-MM, troponin, creatinine, myoglobin (serum and urine), transaminases, total bilirubin, and urinal ysis including urine sediment. A physical 
examination should be performed, documenting findings such as muscle tenderness, weakness, or rash. An ECG should be collected as well. This information should be collected on the appropriate eCRF. For abnormalities to be reported as AEs, see 
Appendix D for a list of muscle AE definitions. 
Abnormalities should be followed until they have returned to baseline, or the Investigator 
considers them clinically stable. 
 Triglyceride Elevations 
For alerts due to fasting TG levels > 2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L), the patient should 
return to the site wi thin 1 week for clini cal and laboratory assessments. Patients should be 
assessed for potential signs or symptoms of  pancreatitis (including measurements of 
serum amylase and lipase), and a repeat assess ment of fasting TG will be obtained. For 
patients with asymptomatic elevations of TG, compliance with study drug and lifestyle recommendations should be assessed and reinforced. Patients should be closely followed 
for the emergence of signs and symptoms  of pancreatitis until TG levels are 
<2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L). If 2 consecutive alerts for a patient are sent due to 
elevated TG levels >2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmo l/L), the Investigator may contact the 
Medical Monitor to discu ss study drug discontinuation and further monitoring. 
To maintain the integrity of the blind, TG  values from post-randomization blood samples 
obtained prior to Visit 7 (Week 12), run by the central laboratory, will not be communicated to the sites (see Section 6.6).

 Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate Decrease 
For eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, the patient should return to the site within 1 week for 
repeat laboratory assessment. Patients who ar e receiving fenofibrate 145 mg can have 
their dose decreased prior to the repeat assessment. Abnormal laboratory parameters 
should be followed at least weekly (more fre quently as clinically  indicated) until they 
have returned to baseline or have stabilized. 
 Electrocardiogram and Vital Signs 
Twelve-lead ECGs will be performed at Visit 1 (Week -8 or Week -6), Visit 4 (Day 1), 
Visit 7 (Week 12), and Visit 11 (Week 52) or the ET Visit. Site personnel will make 
every attempt to perform a patient’s ECG using the same equipment at each visit. 
Vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure) will be assessed at all study 
visits. All blood pressure measurements will be obtained after a 5-minute rest in the 
sitting or supine position with a standard  mercury sphygmomanometer or an automated 
oscillometric blood pressure monitor. Heart ra te measurements will be made by counting 
events (heartbeats) for a period of 30 sec onds and multiplying this value by 2 to obtain 
the rate per minute. Whenever possible, the same person will do all of the assessments for 
a given patient throughout the study. 
 Physical Examination 
A physical examination will be performed at Visit 1 (Week -8 or Week -6), Visit 4 (Day 1), Visit 7 (Week 12), and Visit 11 (Week 52) or the ET Visit. The physical examination will consist of an examination of the following body systems: general appearance; eyes, ears, nose, and throat; head  and neck; chest and lungs; cardiovascular; 
abdomen; musculoskeletal; lymphatic; dermat ological; neurological; mental status; and 
extremities. 
 Demographics and Medical History 
Demographics and brief, relevant medical/socia l and surgical history, as well as alcohol 
consumption, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes history, and family history of heart disease will be taken at Visit 1 (Week -8  or Week -6) and recorded in the eCRF.  
 Body Weight, Height, Body Mass Index, and Waist Circumference 
Body weight, height, and waist circumference will be measured at Visit 1 (Week -8 or 
Week -6). Body weight and height will be us ed to calculate the BMI. Body weight and 
waist circumference will also be measured at Visit 4 (Day 1), Visit 7 (Week 12), and 
Visit 11 (Week 52) or the ET Visit. Waist circumference will be measured with a tape measure. Starting at the top of the hip bone then bringing the tape measure all the way 
around, level with the navel. The tape m easure should be snug around the waist, but 
without compressing the skin, and parallel w ith the floor. Patients should not hold their 
breath while measuring waist circumference.

 CONDUCT OF THE STUDY 
6.1 STUDY BLINDING A ND RANDOMIZATION 
This is a multi-center, placebo-controlled,  randomized, double-blind,  12-week study with 
a 40-week, active-controlled, open-label extensi on. Patients will be randomly assigned in 
a 2:1 ratio to treatment with either K-877 0.2 mg twice daily  or a matching placebo twice 
daily. An Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system will be used to perform the 
randomization. At Visit 7 (Week 12), patients  will enter into the open-label, 40-week 
Extension Period. Patients who were randomi zed to receive K-877 0.2 mg twice daily 
during the 12-week Efficacy Period will con tinue to receive K-877 0.2 mg twice daily. 
Patients randomized to receive placebo matching K-877 0.2 mg twice daily in the 12-week Efficacy Period will initiate fenofibra te dosing at 48 mg once daily at Visit 7 
(Week 12). Starting from Visit 8 (Week 16), Investigators can adjust fenofibrate dosing (to 145 mg once daily) at their discretion a ccording to the local standard of care. 
The Investigator or designee must contact the IRT system to register each patient. Patient 
numbers will consist of an 8-digit number and will be assigned based on the pre-printed 
value on the selected central laboratory re quisition binder. Patient numbers will be 
composed of a 5-digit site  identification (ID) plus a 3-digit patient ID, assigned 
sequentially starting at 001 for the first patient at each site. 
The patient number will be used to iden tify the patient throughout  the study and will be 
entered on all documentation. 
A patient number will not be assigned to more than 1 patient. If a patient is not eligible to 
receive treatment, or should a patient disc ontinue from the study, the patient number 
cannot be reassigned to another patient. 
At Visit 4 (Day 1), qualified patients who m eet all of the inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria will receive the randomly assigned treatment. The Investigator or 
designee must contact the IRT system to randomize each patient. Randomization will be stratified by country and current statin thera py use (not on statin th erapy versus currently 
receiving statin therapy). 
Investigators will be blinded to key results fr om lipid parameters, such as TG and LDL-C, 
obtained prior to Visit 7 (W eek 12), in order to maintain the blind of the treatment 
assignments. Investigators are encouraged not to check lipid panels locally, especially 
during the 12-week Efficacy Period to avoid becoming unblinded. Beginning at Week 12, 
Investigators will receive unblinded lipid data . Investigators will receive an alert for 
TG levels >2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) at any time during the study. To ensure study blinding can be maintained, Investigators may receive a sham alert for TG elevation 
during the 12-week Efficacy Period (see Section 6.6).

13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 28 of 78 6.2 PATIENT INFORMED CONSENT 
Written consent will be obtained from the patient prior to any study-specific procedure or 
investigation. 
Information about the study will be given to th e patient both verbally and in writing. The 
written patient information will explain the obje ctives of the study, its potential risks, and 
benefits and the impact of ear ly withdrawal on th e scientific validity  of the study. The 
patient must have adequate time to read the information and to ask the Investigator any 
questions. The Investigator must be satisfied that the patient has understood the 
information provided before written consent is obtained. If there is any doubt as to 
whether the patient has understood the written and verbal informati on, the patient should 
not enter the study. Participating patients will be  asked to sign and date an IC F, the original copy of which 
will be kept by the Investigator. A copy of th e signed ICF will be given to the patient. A 
record will be made in the source documen t that the patient voluntarily agreed to 
participate in the study.

6.4 COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROTOCOL 
The Investigator must agree to implement the study protocol as written and adhere to the 
guidelines given in the “Investigator’s Statement,” which will be signed by the 
Investigator prior to the start of the study. The study will be performed in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki, Internat ional Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, local la ws, and other applicable guidance documents. 
Sites in the United States will also comply  with the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Food and Dr ug Administration (F DA) GCP regulations 
(21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, and 312).  
Protocol noncompliance must be reported to  and  Kowa Research Institute, Inc. 
(KRI). Each deviation and the reason for its occurrence must be documented. Kowa 
Research Institute, Inc. retains the right to  require the withdrawal of any patient who 
violates the protocol.

13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 36 of 78 6.5 TERMINATION OF THE STUDY 
 Site Termination 
If it becomes apparent that patient enrollment is unsatisfactory with respect to quality or 
quantity, or data recording is inaccurate or  incomplete on a chronic basis, KRI has the 
right to terminate the study at an investigatio nal site and remove all study materials from 
the investigational site. A written statement will be provided to the Investigator, the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC), and regulat ory authorities, if 
required. In the event of any serious or non- serious AE(s) having occurred at a site, all 
documentation relating to the event(s) must be obtained. 
 Study Termination 
If, in the opinion of KRI, the clinical observations in the study suggest that it may be 
unwise to continue, the study may be termin ated. In addition, KRI may terminate the 
study at any time. 
6.6 LABORATORY ALERT RELATED TO HIGH TRIGLYCERIDES 
Sites will receive an alert for any reported TG leve l >2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) during 
the study. In order to maintain the study blind during the placebo-controlled 12-week 
Efficacy Period, sites may receive a sham aler t. A sham alert is an alert which will be 
sent to a site for randomly selected patients who do not actually meet the alert criteria for 
TG levels >2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L). These alerts will be programmed to occur in 
patients assigned to K-877, at the expected (l ow) frequency that they would occur in the 
placebo population, and will be indistinguisha ble from “true” alerts. Investigators are 
expected to respond to every alert (see Section 5.2.2.3).

77°F) in a secured area with access limited to the Investigator and the site staff. The 
permitted excursion temperature range is 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F).  
7.5 DISPENSING AND ADMINISTRATION OF TREATMENT 
Study drugs will be dispensed to eligible pati ents beginning at Visit 4 (Day 1) after 
randomization via the IRT system and at Vi sit 5 (Week 4), Visit 6 (Week 8), Visit 7 
(Week 12), Visit 8 (Week 16), Visit 9 (Week 28 ), and Visit 10 (Week 40). From Visit 4 
(Day 1) to Visit 6 (Week 8), an approximately 1-month supply of blinded study drug will 
be dispensed to patients at each visit. Each patient will receive 1 blister card of 
K-877 0.2 mg or matching placebo. At Visit 7 (Week 12), an approximately 1-month supply of open-label study drug will be dispen sed. Each patient will receive 1 blister card 
of K-877 0.2 mg or 1 bottle of fenofibrate 48 mg. From Visit 8 (Week 16) to Visit 10 
(Week 40), an approximately 3-month supply of open-label study drug will be dispensed 
at each visit. Each patient will receive 3 b lister cards of K-877 0.2 mg or 3 bottles of 
fenofibrate 48 mg or 145 mg.  
Starting at Visit 8 (Week 16), patients who recei ve fenofibrate 48 mg may have their dose 
titrated to fenofibrate 145 mg  and may subsequently have  their dose down-titrated to 
fenofibrate 48 mg, at the discretion of the Inve stigator according to the local standard of 
care.

 Drug Administration 
Patients will receive an oral dose of K- 877 0.2 mg or matching placebo twice daily 
starting at Visit 4 (Day 1) unt il Visit 7 (Week 12). Starting at  Visit 7 (Week 12), patients 
will receive an oral dose of K-877 0.2 mg tw ice daily or fenofibrate 48 mg or 145 mg 
once daily. Patients may take st udy drug in a fed or fasted state (before or after meals); 
however, patients should be in structed that fed/fasted stat e and dosing time should remain 
consistent for all doses throughout the study.  Study drug will be dispensed at Visit 4 
(Day 1) through Visit 10 (Week 40). Patients will be instru cted by the site to follow 
dosing instructions on the drug packaging a nd to return the remaining study drug at the 
next visit. 
7.6 COMPLIANCE WITH PRESCRIBED STUDY DRUG DOSING 
REGIMEN 
Study drug or placebo will be dispensed in excess of the amount required between study visits. Patients will be instru cted to return all unused study  drug at the next visit. The 
patient will be asked whether there have been any problems with taking the medication, 
and the Investigator will record any signifi cant departure from the dosing instructions 
(e.g., misuse or overdose) as a protocol devi ation. A record of the number of tablets 
dispensed, taken, and returned for each  patient must be documented on the Drug 
Accountability Log and eCRF. Co mpliance will be assessed from  information recorded in 
the eCRF, including study drug count and the st art and end date of therapy. Patients will 
be considered compliant if they have taken between 80% and 120% of the intended 
regimen. 
During the treatment period, if compliance is  not between 80% and 120%, inclusive, the 
patient will be counseled about the importance of compliance with the regimen. See 
Section 7.5.1 for study drug administration. 
7.7 DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY 
Sites will be instructed to maintain drug accoun tability and retain al l used, partially used, 
and unused study drug materials until the end of the study. 
7.8 PROCEDURE FOR UNBLINDING 
As needed, the randomization code may be broken by the Investigator to manage an 
urgent medical event. If possible, the Medica l Monitor will be contacted to discuss the 
case and ET assessments will be completed before the code is broken. 
For each patient, the treatment group can be unblinded using the IRT system and the 
site’s Emergency Unblinding IRT Code, provided with the site’s study start-up materials. 
Using the Emergency Unblinding IRT Code, the Investigator or designee will be able to 
unblind a patient by following the instructions on the  
 When the unblinding is completed, the study’s Medical Monitor,  the Clinical Trial 
Manager, and designated KRI personnel will be notified that the unblinding has taken 
place.

recommendations (see Appendix E) with implementation beginning at Visit 1 (Week -8 or Week -6). From Visit 4 (Day 1), the Investigator or designee will instruct patients to stably maintain these lifestyle changes. Goals and recommendations on diet,
18 weight loss, 
physical activity, and abstaining from alcohol  will be reviewed at all study visits.

 ADVERSE EVENTS 
9.1 ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITION 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
pharmaceutical product. An AE can, therefore,  be any unfavorable and unintended sign, 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether 
or not related to the medicinal product. A ny worsening of the patient’s disease under 
study or other medical conditions will also be considered to be an AE, unless it is within 
the normal range of disease fluctuation for that patient. 
Clinically meaningful (for a given patient) changes in physical ex amination findings and 
abnormal objective test findings (e.g., clinical laboratory tests, ECGs) will also be 
recorded as AEs. The criteria for determini ng whether an abnormal objective test finding 
will be reported as an AE are as follows: 
1. Test result is associated with  accompanying symptoms, and/or; 
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/sur gical intervention, 
and/or; 
3. Test result leads to a change in stud y drug dosing or discontinuation from the 
study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, and/or; 
4. Test result leads to any of  the outcomes included in th e definition of an SAE.  
Merely repeating a test, in the absence of  any of the above conditions, does not meet 
condition number 2 above for reporting as an AE. 
Any abnormal test result that is determined to  be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an AE that begins af ter the start of study 
drug or an event that begins before the start of the study drug and worsens in intensity 
after starting treatment with the study drug. 
9.2 ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS 
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose will be considered adverse drug reactions. The phras e “responses to a medicinal product” means 
that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and the AE is at least a reasonable 
possibility (see Section 9.3). 
9.3 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS 
At each evaluation, the Investigator will de termine whether any AEs have occurred. The 
patient will be questioned in a general wa y and no specific symptoms will be suggested. 
If any AEs have occurred, they will be recorded on the AE pages of the eCRF and in the 
CONFIDENTIAL  Kowa Research Institute, Inc.  
K-877-303, Study Protocol K-877 
 
 
13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 45 of 78 patient’s medical record. If known, the diagnos is should be recorded, in preference to the 
listing of individual signs and symptoms. 
Adverse event assessment and reporting begins w ith the signing of informed consent, and 
occurs at every scheduled study visit thr ough Visit 11 (Week 52), unless an unresolved 
AE is still being followed (see Section 9.4). The severity (intensity) of AEs will be classified as follows: 
• Mild: An AE that is easily tolerated by the patient, causes minimal discomfort, 
and does not interfere with  everyday activities;  
• Moderate: An AE that causes enough di scomfort to inte rfere with normal 
everyday activities and may require intervention; and 
• Severe: An AE that prevents normal everyday activities;  
o Note: Treatment or interventi on will usually be required.  
The Investigator will make a judgment regard ing whether or not the AE was related to 
the study drug. The following factors should be considered: 
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration- 
o The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event s hould be evaluated in the clinical 
context of the event. 
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases- 
o Each report should be evaluated in th e context of the natural history and 
course of the disease being treated and any other disease the patient may 
have. 
• Concomitant drugs- 
o The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the patient receives should be examined to determine whet her any of them might be recognized 
to cause the event in question. 
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug- 
o Clinical and/or preclinical data may i ndicate whether a par ticular response is 
likely to be a class effect. 
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses- 
o The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the patient and 
provide a logical and better explanation for the event. 
• The pharmacology and PK of the study drug- 
o The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the study drug should be considered. 
CONFIDENTIAL  Kowa Research Institute, Inc.  
K-877-303, Study Protocol K-877 
 
 
13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 46 of 78 The relationship of an AE to the admini stration of the study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions: 
• Definite: An AE which is consistent w ith the suspected ty pe of reaction known 
for the drug, in line with the reasonable temporal order after treatment, and is 
alleviated or disappears upon di scontinuation of the study drug; 
• Probable: An AE which is consistent w ith the suspected ty pe of reaction known 
for the drug, in line with the reasonable tem poral order after trea tment, alleviates 
or disappears upon discontinuation of the st udy drug, but could also be caused by 
the clinical conditions of the st udy patient or ot her factors;  
• Possible: An AE which is consistent with the suspected type of reaction known for the drug, not in line with the reasona ble temporal order after treatment, and 
could also be caused by the clinical c onditions of the study patient or other 
factors;  
• Improbable: An AE which is inconsistent with the suspected type of reaction known for the drug, not in line with the reas onable temporal order after treatment, 
and could also be caused by the clinical conditions of the study patient or other 
factors; and 
• Not related: An AE which is inconsistent with the suspected type of reaction known for the drug, not in line with th e reasonable temporal order from 
administration of the study drug, or that can  be easily explained by other factors, 
such as underlying diseases, complication, concomitant drugs, and concurrent treatment.  
If the causality assessment for an individual ev ent is “Definite,” “Pr obable,” or “Possible,” 
the event will be considered a suspected adverse drug reaction.  
The Investigator will evaluate any changes in laboratory values, make a determination as 
to whether or not the change is clinically important, and whether or not the changes were 
related to the study drug. Howeve r, even if the Investigator feels there is no relationship 
to the study drug, the AE or laboratory abnormality MUST be recorded in the eCRF. 
The Investigator will record the action taken to treat the AE, if any, the action taken with 
study treatment, and the outcome for each AE in the eCRF according to the following: 
Action taken to treat the AE 
• None, 
• Treatment required, 
• Hospitalization, 
• Patient withdrawn, or 
• Other (specify). 
CONFIDENTIAL  Kowa Research Institute, Inc.  
K-877-303, Study Protocol K-877 
 
 
13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 47 of 78 Action taken with study treatment 
• Dose not changed, 
• Dose reduced, 
• Drug interrupted, 
• Drug withdrawn, 
• Not applicable, or 
• Unknown. 
Outcome 
• Resolved: The event has recovered;  
o Note: An SAE/AE stop date should be provided.  
• Resolved with sequelae: The study pati ent has recovered as much as may be 
expected but is left with sequelae of th e event that are not expected to recover 
further;  
o Note: If the sequelae are severe enough to represent a significant disability 
or incapacity then the event s hould be reported as an SAE. 
• Resolving: Can be used in cases wher e study patient is known to be clearly 
recovering from the event at the end of a study, although the event is not yet 
resolved, and the Investigator and Medical Monitor agree that further follow-up is 
not necessary; 
• Death: The study patient died as a result of the AE;  
o Note: Death is considered an outcome of an AE rather than an AE in its own 
right, and the cause of death should be  recorded as the AE. There may be 
rare circumstances where the cause of  death is unknown and the death may 
have to be recorded as  the event (e.g., “sudden cardiac death”). Adverse 
events resulting in death are SAEs. 
• Not resolved: The patient has an AE that has not improved or recuperated at the 
time of the report; or 
o Note: The decision not to continue follow-up should be discussed between 
the Investigator and Medical Monitor and recorded in the source documents. 
• Unknown: The outcome of the event is ge nuinely unknown in spite of efforts to 
contact the patient.

13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 48 of 78 9.4 FOLLOW-UP OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
If any AEs are present when a patient completes the study, or if a patient is withdrawn 
from the study, the patient will be re-evaluated. At the Investigator’s discretion, clinically 
minor AEs can be re-evaluated via telephone and documented. If the AE is still not 
resolved, additional follow-up will be performe d as appropriate. Every effort will be 
made by the Investigator or delegate to contact the patient until the AE is resolved or stabilized, or until the Medical Monitor and Investigator agree that further follow-up is 
not necessary. The follow-up of AEs will be documented in the patient’s study records.

 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, 
• Is life-threatening, 
• Requires patient hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitalization, 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
• Is an important medical event. 
Medical and scientific judgmen t should be exercised in de ciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or result in d eath or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
patient or may require intervention to prev ent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above.  
10.1 LIFE-THREATENING ADVERSE EVENT 
The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at  the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
10.2 HOSPITALIZATION OR PROLONGATION OF EXISTING HOSPITALIZATION 
Hospitalization is defined as the patient being hospitalized overnight, or the patient’s hospital stay being prolonged for at least an  additional overnight stay. An emergency 
room visit without hospital admission will not be recorded as an SAE under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled or planned before the signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospitalization that occu r during elective surgery should be recorded as AEs and assessed 
for seriousness. Admission to the hospital for social or situational reasons (i.e., no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits) will not be considered inpatient hospitalizations. Twenty-three hour hospitalizat ions for observation should be discussed 
with the Medical Monitor to determine whet her they are appropria te for SAE reporting. 
10.3 PREGNANCY 
If a patient becomes pregnant during the st udy or within 30 days of discontinuing study 
drug, the Investigator will report the pregnancy to  within 
24 hours of being notified (see Section 10.6.1 for contact information).  
 will then forward the Exposure In Utero form to the Investigator for completion.  
A patient who becomes pregnant while on study drug will immediately be withdrawn from the study and ET study procedures will be performed. 

CONFIDENTIAL  Kowa Research Institute, Inc.  
K-877-303, Study Protocol K-877 
 
 
13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 50 of 78 The patient will be followed by the Investigat or until completion of the pregnancy. If the 
pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator will notify 
. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will 
document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the 
criteria for immediate classification as  an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death,  or congenital anomaly), the Investigator 
will follow the procedures for reporting an SAE (see Section 10.6). 
10.4 PATIENT WITHDRAWAL 
If a patient experiences an AE that leads to  discontinuation of study drug treatment and/or 
withdrawal from the study, th e eCRF will identify the AE as the reason for study drug 
discontinuation or withdrawal. 10.5 SERIOUS UNEXPECTED SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS 
According to FDA CFR 312.32(a), FDA Guid ance “Safety Reporting Requirements for 
Investigational New Drugs (INDs) and Bioava ilability/Bioequivalence (BA/BE) Studies” 
finalized December 2012, European Directives 2001/20/EC and CT-3 Guideline, 
suspected adverse reaction mean s any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the medicinal product caused the AE. The phrase “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship be tween the AE and the medicinal product 
(see Section 9.3). 
The following are examples of types of eviden ce that would suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly 
associated with drug exposure (e.g., angi oedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome); or 
• One or more occurrences of an event that  is not commonly asso ciated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in  the population exposed to the drug 
(e.g., tendon rupture).  
A suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Reference Safety Information in Section 6 of  the K-877 Investigator’s Brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that ha s been described in th e K-877 Investigator’s 
Brochure or the approved package insert of fe nofibrate. Study sites will be provided with 
the current version of the fenofibrate package insert. The Sponsor will report suspected unexpected  serious adverse reac tions (SUSARs) to 
Investigators, Competent Authorities, and IRB/ECs in an expedited manner according to 
national requirements. Fatal and life-threatening SUSARs will be reported within 
7 calendar days of Day 0, where Day 0 is de fined as the day on which the information 
containing the minimum reporting criteria is  received by the Sponsor. All other SUSARs 
will be reported within 15 calendar days of Day 0. All cases will be unblinded for 
reporting purposes, as required.

13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 51 of 78 10.6 REPORTING SERIOUS ADVERSE EV ENTS, URGENT SAFETY ISSUES, 
AND SERIOUS BREACHES 
 Serious Adverse Events 
 Initial Reports  
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent until 30 days following the last 
administration of study drug must be repor ted to  within 
24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any AE that meets any of the 
aforementioned serious criteria). All SAEs that the Investigator considers related to study drug occurring after the 30 day follow-up pe riod must be reported to the Sponsor. 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form el ectronically in the el ectronic data capture 
(EDC) system for the study. When the form is completed,  will 
be notified electronically and wi ll retrieve the form. If the event meets serious criteria and 
it is not possible to access the EDC syst em, send an email to  
 or call  
 and fax the completed paper SAE form to  
 within 24 hours of awareness. When the EDC system becomes available, 
the SAE information must be entered within 24 hours. 
Safety Contact Information:  
 
 
 
 
 Follow-Up Reports 
The Investigator must continue to follow the patient until the SAE has subsided or until 
the condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the patient dies. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up info rmation, the Investigator must update the 
SAE form electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any supporting 
documentation (e.g., patient discharge summar y or autopsy reports) to  
 via fax or email. If it is not possible to access the EDC system, refer to the 
procedures outlined above for initial reporting of SAEs. Written confirmation that these 
serious, unexpected, and related AEs have been submitted to the IRB/EC must be forwarded to KRI and kept in  the Investigator files.

 Urgent Safety Issues and Serious Brea ches of Clinical Trial Regulation 
If  or any Investigator become aware of an actual 
or potential urgent safety issue or a seri ous breach of clinical trial regulations, the 
Medical Monitor and th e Sponsor must be immediately c ontacted so that agreement can 
be made on appropriate urgent safety measur es. An urgent safety issue is defined as: 
• An immediate hazard to the health or safe ty of study patients  participating in a 
clinical trial, or 
• A serious risk to human health or poten tially a serious risk to human health. 
An urgent safety issue may include issues with an investigational drug or comparators, 
study procedures, intercurrent illness (inc luding pandemic infections), concomitant 
medications, concurrent medical conditions, or  any other issues related to the safe 
conduct of the study or that pose a risk to study patients. 
In exceptional circumstances of imminent haza rd and in order to safeguard the health or 
safety of individuals,  may take urgent safety m easures before informing the 
Sponsor, but the Sponsor must be informed immediately after the hazard has been 
resolved.

 STATISTICAL METHOD S AND DATA ANALYSIS 
11.1 SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION 
Approximately 420 patients with fasting TG levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and 
<2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) and mild or moderate renal impairment will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio into one of the following treatment groups: K-877 0.2 mg twice 
daily or identical matching placebo twice daily.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
11.2 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
The study population will con
sist of male and female patients ≥18 years of age with 
fasting TG levels ≥500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L) and <2000 mg/dL (22.60 mmol/L) after 
washout from background lipid-altering therapy other than statins, ezetimibe, or PCSK9 inhibitors and with mild or moderate re nal impairment. The ac tive-controlled study 
population will consist of patients who comp lete the 12-week portion of the efficacy 
study and who continue the study. 
 Full Analysis Set 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all randomized patients who take at least 
1 dose of double-blind study drug and have a baseline TG measurement. The FAS 
Population is the primary analysis population. All efficacy analyses will be performed on the FAS Population. 
 Per-Protocol Set 
The Per-Protocol Set will include all FAS pa tients for the 12-week Efficacy Period who 
complete the 12-week, placebo-controlled E fficacy Period without any major protocol 
deviations and have valid baseline and W eek 12 fasting serum TG measurements. Major 
protocol deviations will be pre-specified prior to unblinding the study. The Per-Protocol 

CONFIDENTIAL  Kowa Research Institute, Inc.

13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 54 of 78 Set will be used to assess robustness of the primary analysis results during the 12-week 
Efficacy Period. 
 Safety Analysis Set 
The Safety Analysis Set will include all random ized patients who receive at least 1 dose 
of randomized study drug. All safety analyses  will be conducted on the Safety Analysis 
Set. 
 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set 
The PK Analysis Set will include all patients from the Safety Analysis Set who have at 
least 1 PK sample.  
11.3 DEMOGRAPHIC/BASELINE INFORMATION 
Summary statistics will be provided by trea tment group for demographics (e.g., age, 
gender, race, and ethnicity).  
Baseline for TG, TC, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, LD L-C, and remnant cholesterol will be 
defined as the mean of Visit 4 (Day 1) and the preceding TG qualifying visit (either 
Visit 3 [Week -1] or Visit 3.1, if required) measurements. Baseline for all other efficacy 
and safety variables will be defined as Visit 4 (Day 1). If the measurement at this visit is 
missing, the last measurement prior to the first dose of randomized study drug will be 
used. 
 
 
 
11.4 STUDY DRUG EXPOSURE, COMP LIANCE, AND CONCOMITANT 
THERAPIES 
Days of exposure to randomized study drug and study drug for the 12-week Efficacy Period and the 40-week Extension Period will be  summarized with descriptive statistics 
by treatment for the Safety Analysis Set. Expos ure in days is defined as the date of last 
dose of study drug minus the date of first dose of study drug plus 1. 
Patient compliance with the study drug will be summarized by treatment group in each 
period. 
Prior/concomitant medications will be coded with Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
(ATC) class and preferred term (defined by the most recent version of the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary) and summarize d by ATC class and preferred term for 
each treatment group for the Safety Analysis Set.

13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 55 of 78 11.5 ANALYSIS OF EFFICACY  
 Hypothesis Testing Procedure 
In order to control the family-wise Type I error at a 0.05 level , a fixed sequential testing 
procedure will be implemented. In a hierarchical step-down manner, the primary endpoint 
will be tested first, followed by secondary endpoints, tested in  the following hierarchical 
manner: percent change from baseline to Week 12 in a fixed sequence of (1) remnant 
cholesterol (calculated as TC −  LDL-C − HDL-C), (2) HDL-C, (3) Apo A1, and 
(4) non-HDL-C. Each test is planned to be  performed at a 0.05 significance level. 
Inferential conclusions about these efficacy endpoints will requi re statistical significance 
of the previous one. 
For other efficacy endpoints, nominal p-values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will 
be presented, but should not be  considered as confirmatory. 
 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Parameters 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on Hodges-Lehmann estimator with 
pattern-mixture model imputation based on the FAS. The pattern-mixture model will be used as the primary imputation method as part of the primary analysis for the percent change in fasting TGs from baseline to Week 12. This imputation model will include 
factors such as patient demographics, disease status, and baseline TG, as well as adherence to therapy. The imputation model will impute missing Week 12 TG values as follows: 
• For patients who do not adhere to th erapy and who do not have a Week 12 
measurement, the missing data imputation method will use patients in the same treatment arm who do not adhere to ther apy and have a Week 12 measurement; 
and 
• If there are no patients in the same treatment arm who do not adhere to therapy 
and have a Week 12 measurement, missi ng Week 12 TG values will be imputed 
as follows: 
o For the K-877 arm, the treatment eff ect is considered washed out and 
baseline TG values will be used to impute the Week 12 TG values; and 
o For the placebo arm, missing Week 12 TG values will be imputed 
assuming missing at random, includ ing patient demographics, disease 
status, and baseline and post-baseline efficacy data from the placebo arm.  
After the multiple imputation step, each im puted dataset will be analyzed by the 
nonparametric Hodges-Lehmann method and the Hodges-Lehmann estimator and 
standard error will be combined to produce treatment difference estimate and 95% CI and 
p-value. 
CONFIDENTIAL Kowa Research Institute, Inc. 
K-877-303, Study Protocol K-877
13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 56 of 78 The primary efficacy analysis will be repeated on the Per-Protocol Set. 
Summ
ary statistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
maximum, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile) at baseline, each scheduled visit, and 
change and percent change in fasting TG from baseline to each scheduled visit will be 
provided. 
Analysis of Secondary and Expl oratory Efficacy Parameters 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included in the hierarchical step-down testing procedure 
include percent change from baseline to Week 12 in a fixed sequence of (1) remnant 
cholesterol, (2) HDL-C, (3 ) Apo A1, and (4) non-HDL-C. 
The secondary and exploratory efficacy e ndpoints during the 12-week Efficacy Period 
will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model w ith the same imputation method used for 
the primary analysis. The ANCOVA model will include country, current statin therapy 
use (not on statin th erapy versus currently receiving statin therapy), and treatment as 
factors; baseline value as a covariate. If  the normality assumption is not met, the 
Hodges-Lehmann estimator with the same imputation method used for the primary 
analysis will be used. 
The secondary efficacy endpoint of percent change in fasting TG from baseline to 
Week 52 will be summarized descriptively.
Other efficacy endpoints during the 40-week Extension Period will be 
summarized descriptively. No hypothesis testing will be performed. 
11.6 ANALYSIS OF SAFETY DATA 
The safety endpoint data will be summarized for the Safety Analysis Set for the 12-week

responsible for the preparati on, content, and IRB/EC approval of the ICF. The ICF must 
be approved by the site-designated IRB/EC  and be acceptable to KRI and  
The ICF must be written in a language fully comprehensible to the prospective patient. 
The Investigator or designee will give the patient adequate opportunity to read it before it 
is signed and dated. Information provided w ill be given in both oral and written form 
whenever possible and in the manner deemed  appropriate by the IRB/EC. Patients must 
be given ample opportunity to inquire about study details. 
12.4 AMENDMENTS TO THE PROTOCOL 
An amendment must be agreed to in writi ng by KRI and  submitted as an IND 
application amendment in the United Stat es, and submitted to and approved by the 
respective IRB/EC for each investigational site , and an applicable regulatory authority 
before it is implemented. Written approval of a protocol amendment is not required prior to implementation for changes to the protoc ol that eliminate immediate hazard to the 
patient; however, approval must be obtaine d as soon as possible thereafter. Approved 
amendments must also be signed by the Investigator. 
12.5 STUDY INITIATION 
The Investigator must not enroll any patients prior to the completion of a formal meeting 
conducted by a representative of  or KRI. This meeting will include a detailed 
review of the study protocol and eCRFs.  Study drug will not be supplied to an 
Investigator until all the necessary pre-study requirements have been completed and essential signed documents are received by  and KRI. 
12.6 STUDY MONITORING 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator  to ensure that the study is conducted in 
accordance with the protocol, ICH/FDA GCPs , other applicable regional or local 
regulatory requirements, HIPAA,  and the current Declaration of Helsinki. Valid data are 
to be entered into the eCRFs. 
To achieve this objective, the monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the same 
time,  and KRI in the maintenance of acc urate, complete, legible, well-organized, 
and easily retrievable data. The monitor will revi ew the protocol with the Investigator. In 
addition, the monitor will explain the Investig ator’s reporting res ponsibilities and all 
applicable regulations concerning the clinical evaluation of the study drug. 
The Investigator will permit the representativ es of KRI and  to monitor the study 
as frequently as  or KRI deems is n ecessary to determine th at data recording and 
protocol adherence are acceptable. The eCRFs and related source documents will be 
reviewed in detail by the monitor at each visit, in accordance with relevant Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), ICH GCP gui dance, and FDA GCP regulations. This 
includes results of tests performed as a requirement for partic ipation in this study and any 
other medical records required to confirm info rmation contained in the eCRFs, such as

cooperate with the monitor and provide any missing information, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be summarized in a report, which will be filed in the Trial 
Master File. In addition, performance of monitoring visits will be acknowledged at the 
investigational site by the m onitor’s signature and date on the study-specific monitoring 
log. 
12.7 CASE REPORT FORM 
All patient data generated during the study w ill be recorded on the eCRF. Data will be 
reviewed by the KRI or  Clinical Research Associate (CRA) during monitoring 
visits. The CRA will verify the accuracy of data recorded on the eCRF using source 
documents.  
The Investigator will ensure that all data ar e entered promptly, legibly, and completely, in 
accordance with specific instructions accomp anying the eCRFs, which will be designed 
for this study and supplied by  for each patient. The Investigat or will also ensure 
that all applicable entries agree with the source data. 
 will only consider the eCRFs to be co mplete after they ar e reviewed and signed 
by the Investigator, indicating his/her assurance of  the accuracy of all recorded data. It is 
expected that the Investigator and staff will cooperate with the monitoring team and 
provide missing data in a timely manner. 
12.8 VERIFICATION PROCEDURES 
In fulfillment of their obligations to KRI an d to verify compliance with this protocol, 
ICH GCP guidance, FDA GCP regulations (in th e United States), local regulations, and 
regulations in the countries in which the st udy is conducted, the Inve stigator will permit 
 the IRB/EC, the monitor, the auditors, and regulatory authorities to have direct 
access to the patient’s medical records. It is the Investigator’s obligation to ensure  documentation of all relevant data in the 
patient’s medical record. The patient’s medical  record will be considered the source 
document and must include the following in formation: medical history/concomitant 
disease, patient ID number, confirmation of informed consent and the date of study 
enrollment, visit dates, admini stration of study drugs, AEs (sta rt and stop dates), and all 
concomitant medications (start and stop date s). This information may not be recorded 
directly into the eCRF. The Investigator will maintain a Patient ID Code List to enable unambiguous ID of the 
patients (patient names and co rresponding patient numbers).

*Clinical ASCVD includes acute coronary sy ndromes, history of MI, stable or unstabl e angina, coronary or other arterial 
revascularization, stroke, TIA, or peripheral arterial  disease presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin. 
†Contraindications, warnings, and precautions are defined for each statin according to the manufacturer’s prescribing informati on. 
‡Individuals with secondary causes of hyperlipidemia were excluded from RCTs reviewed. A TG level ≥500 mg/dL was an 
exclusion criterion for almost all RCTs. Ther efore, ruling out secondary causes is necessary to avoid inappropriate statin ther apy.  
§No RCTs included only individuals with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL. However, many trials did include individuals with 
LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, and all of these trials consistently demonstrated  a reduction in ASCVD events. In addition, the Cholesterol 
Treatment Trialists meta-analyses have shown that each 39-mg /dL reduction in LDL-C with statin therapy reduced ASCVD 
events by 22%, and the relative reductions in  ASCVD events were consistent across the range of LDL-C levels. Therefore, 
individuals with primary LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL should be treated with stain therapy. 
ǁEstimated 10-year or “hard” ASCVD risk includes first occurrence of nonfatal MI, coronary heart disease death, and nonfatal and  
fatal stroke as used by the Risk Assessment Work  Group in developing the Pooled Cohort Equations. 
¶These factors may include primary LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL or other evidence of genetic hyper lipidemias; family history of premature 
ASCVD with onset <55 years of age in a first degree male rela tive or <65 years of age in a first degree female relative; 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥2 mg/L; CAC score ≥300 Agatston units, or ≥75th percentile for age, sex, and ethnicity;

Boldface type indicates specific statins and doses that were evaluated in  RCTs included in CQ1, CQ2, and the Cholesterol Treatment 
Trialists 2010 meta-analysis included in CQ3. All of these RCTs demonstrated a reduction in major cardiovascular events.  
Italic type  indicates statins and doses that ha ve been approved by the FDA but were  not tested in the RCTs reviewed.  
*Individual responses to statin therapy varied in the RCTs and s hould be expected to vary in c linical practice. There might be a 
biological basis for a less-than-average response.

‡Although simvastatin 80 mg was evaluated in RCTs, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not recommended by the 
FDA because of the increas ed risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.

Safety  
1. To maximize the safety of statins, selection of the appropriate statin 
and dose in men and nonpregnant/ nonnursing women should be based 
on patient characteristics, level of ASCVD* risk, and potential for adverse effects. Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be used in 
individuals in whom high-intensity statin therapy would otherwise be 
recommended when characteristics predisposing them to statin-
associated adverse effects are present. Characteristics predisposing individuals to statin adverse effects 
include but are not limited to: 
• Multiple or serious comorbidities, including impaired renal or hepatic function; 
• History of previous statin into lerance or muscle disorders; 
• Unexplained ALT elevations ≥3 times ULN; 
• Patient characteristics or concomitant  use of drugs affecting statin 
metabolism; 
• Age >75 years; and 
• Additional characteristics that could modify the decision to use higher statin intensities might include but are not limited to: 
o History of hemorrhagic stroke, and  
o Asian ancestry. A (Strong) I B

13 Sep 2016 v1.0 Page 75 of 78 Statin Intolerance 
Statin intolerance occurs when a patient is unable to continue statin therapy due to a 
negative side effect or because creatine ki nase (elevations >10 × upper limit of normal 
[ULN]) and/or hepatic transaminases (a lanine aminotransferase and aspartate 
aminotransferase; elevations >3 × ULN) ar e sufficiently abnormal to cause concern for 
muscle and liver function, respectively. Intolera nce can be partial (sta tin-specific and/or 
specific doses) or complete (a ll statins at any dose).  
Myalgia is the most common presentation of st atin intolerance, which can occur in up to 
15% of treated patients. Other common presentations of statin intolerance include myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (see Appendix D fo r muscle event definitions). Table B4 
contains a complete list of potential adverse effects due to statin therapy.

Adverse Effects for Which There is Good 
Supportive Evidence Adverse Effects for Which There is Little or No 
Supportive Evidence 
Myopathy (muscle aches/cramps, myositis, 
rhabdomyolysis) Cancer 
Increase in liver function enzymes Intrace rebral hemorrhage (bleeding stroke) 
New-onset diabetes mellitus Cognitive decline (Alzheimer disease) 
 Lung disease 
 Erectile dysfunction 
 Fatigue, headaches, or dizziness 
 Psychiatric illness 
 Cataracts 
 Rheumatoid arthritis

Statin intolerance will be managed by re ducing the dose of statin to the maximum 
tolerated statin intensity per Table B1 and in accordance with the study design 
(see Section 8.4).

Spectrum of Muscle Adverse Events 
• Myalgia Unexplained muscle discomfort often described as “flu-like” symptoms with normal 
creatine kinase (CK) level. The spect rum of myalgia complaints includes: 
Muscle aches, 
Muscle soreness, 
Muscle stiffness, 
Muscle tenderness, and Muscle cramps with or shortly afte r exercise (not nocturnal cramping). 
• Myopathy Muscle weakness (not attributed to pain an d not necessarily associated with elevated 
CK). 
• Myositis Muscle inflammation. 
• Myonecrosis Muscle enzyme elevations or hyperCKemia. 
o Mild = >3-fold upper limit of normal. 
o Moderate =  ≥10-fold upper limit of normal. 
o Severe =  ≥50-fold upper limit of normal.  
• Myonecrosis with myoglobinuria or acute re nal failure (increase in serum creatinine ≥0.5 mg/dL 
(clinical rhabdomyolysis).

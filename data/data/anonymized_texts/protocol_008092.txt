Title of study : Tolerability and Immunogenicity of a Single 40 -µg Dose of Recombinant Botulinum 
Vaccine A/B (rBV A/B) for the Production of BabyBI G® in Volunteers with Existing Botulinum 
Immunity  
Sponsor Investigator: Dr. Stephen  S. Arnon  
Number of sites: 2 
Stud y period: 18 months  Phase of development: Phase 2 
Objectives:  
 
Immunogenicity: The immunogen icity objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a single 40-
µg dose of the recombinant botulinum vaccine A/B (rBV A/B ) on botulinum toxin t ype A and type B 
neutralizing antibody concentration (NAC) over  a 12-week  period following vaccination in participants 
who have previously been immunized with pentavalent botulinum toxoid (or pentavalent botulinum 
toxoid and rBV A/B) for occupational protection . 
 
Safety:  The safety  objective of this study is to obtain safety informatio n during the 12- week study 
period and at 6 months post -vaccination on the use of rBV  A/B in a population of participants  
previ ously  immunized with pentav alent botulinum toxoid (or pentavalent botulinum toxoid and rBV 
A/B) for occupational  protection.  
 
Exploratory : 
The exploratory objective of this study is t o collect source plasma from participants  that contains  
neutralizing antibodies against  botuli num toxin type A and type B for the production of BabyBIG . 
Methodology:  This Phase 2, open -label , uncontrolled  study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, 
and immunogenicity of a single dose of rBV A/B in healthy participants  previously immunized with 
pentavalent botulinum toxoid (or pentavalent botulinum toxoid and rBV A/B)  for occupational 
protection  will be conducted to collect source plasma for  potential use in the production of BabyBIG  
and to evaluate  safety and immunogenic ity of the vaccine in these participants  over a  12-week period , 
with a follow -up safety  assessment at 6  months .   
 
The study period is defined as the 12- week period that includes the clinic visits and plasmapheresis 
visits. The study period will end at Week 4 for participants who opt not to participate  in plasmapheresis  
or who have been determined to be  ineligible for  plasma  donation for the entire study.

0.2%   (wt/vol) Alhydrogel™  
Test product, dose, and mode of administration:   
rBV A/B i njections will consist of 40 -µg of total antigen (20 µg of Antigen A and 20 µg of Antigen  B) 
adsorbed to 0.2% (w t/vol) Alhydrogel™, in a total dose volume of 0.5 mL.  The vaccine will be 
administered by intramuscular injection in the del toid muscle, preferably in the nondominant arm.  
Reference therapy, dose , and mode of administration :  
No reference therapy will be employed . 
Duration of treatment: Vaccine administration for all enrolled participants will occur at Day 0 , and 
participant s may elect to undergo plasmapheres is up to two times a week for up to 12 weeks , with the 
final on- site visit at Week  12 (± 4 days) and follow -up phone call for safety assessment at Week 26 
after vaccination .  Participant s can elect to continue plasmapheresis up to 14 weeks  post-vaccination  
as long as  long as they continue to meet source plasma donor eligibility requirements .. 
Criteria for Evaluation  
Populations : 
The immunogenicity population will include all participant s who have received the study vaccine at 
the assigned dosage and for whom at least one post -baseline NAC  was collected  within 4 weeks of 
vaccination .  For each post -vaccination  assessment  time point, t he per protocol population  will include 
all participant s who received the vaccine dose, have a baseline NAC , and have all immunogenicity 
assessments completed within the protocol -specified timelines (including visit windows) for the time 
periods summarized and do not have major protocol violations  expected to affect immunogenicity.  A 
determination of major protocol violations  expected to affect immunogenicity will be done by the 
spons or-investigator  before revi ewing the immunogenicity data for the applicable participant . 
 
Immunogenicity : 
 
The p rimary endpoint  is as follows : 
• The proportion of participants a chieving a four times or greater increase in NAC by Week 4 
compared with Week  0. A positive response will be  defined as achieving this level of increase in 
at least 50% of the participant s for botulinum toxin A and toxin B . 
The s econdary endpoint s are as follows :   
• The proportion of participants a chieving a two times increase in the area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve between Week 0 and Week 12 in NAC in comparison to a straight -line 
extension of the Week 0 NAC to Week 12. A positive response will be defined as achieving  this 
level of in crease in at least 50% of the participant s for botulinum toxin A and toxin B . 
• The proportion of participants a chieving a three times or greater increase in NAC by  Week 4 
compared with Week 0. A positive response will be defined in at least 50% of the participant s for 
botulinum toxin A and toxin B .

Study design:  This will be an o pen-label , uncontrolled  study to evaluate the safety and 
immun ogeni city of a single 40-µg intramuscular injection of rBV A/B in participant s who were 
previously immunized with pentavalent botulinum toxoid (or pentavalent botulinum toxoid and rBV 
A/B)  for occupational protection. Participants will receive the rBV A/B injection, and undergo 
plasm apheresis up to two times per week for up to 14 weeks.  Participants  will be evaluated for safety 
and immunogenicity at each study visit with follow -up safety data collected at 6 months.  If participant s 
opt not to participate  in plasma collections or have been determined to be ineligible to donate plasma  
for the entire study , they will have  a final on- site visit at Week 4 to provide a serum sample for NAC 
determination and an additional hematology specimen. Participants undergoing plasmapheresis will 
also have an additional hematology specimen collected at Week 4.  Study participants participating in 
plasma donations will have a final on- site study visit at Week 12. All participant s will have a final  
phone call for safety follow -up at Week 26.  
 
Experimental procedures : Participant s who meet inclusion criteria and do not meet any exclusion 
criteria will receive  a single  rBV A/B injection  at Week 0 and will complete a 7 -day diary  for the 
Week  1 telephone  call. Clinical safety laboratory assessments (serum chemistry, hematology, and 
urinalysis) will be obtained for all participants  at the screening visit . Hematology  only will be assessed 
during the Week 4 visit.   Study participants who consent to plasma donation may report to the plasma 
collection center after the Week 1 visit where they will be assessed by the center for donor eligibility.  
Once donor eligibility has been confirmed, the participant may choose to donate plasma twice a week 
for up to 14 weeks.  
 
Safety considerations:  Participant s will be monitored for serious adverse events after vaccination 
throughout the  12-week  study  period and at the Week 26 phone call follow -up.  Administration site 
reactions  and systemic reactions will be monitored with a diary provided to collect information , 
including diameter of any swelling  and redness around the injection site  and any generalized symptoms 
between Week 0 and Week 1  in order to determine if any severe reactions or  serious adverse events  
occurred  during this 1 -week period post -vaccination .  All severe local and systemic reactions will be 
recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  Hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis 
specimens will be collected at screen ing, and repeat hematology at Week 4 for monitoring of any 
clinical ly significant changes  that result in a severe or serious AE .  Clinically significant changes in 
hematology  that result in a severe or serious AE will be recorded on  the eCRF . Female participants of 
childbearing  potential will have a urine pregnancy test at screening and again at Week 0 prior to receipt 
of the vaccine. S ource plasma collection will occur for eligible donors at licensed collection locations.  
If the pa rticipant  fails to meet donor criteria at any time during the plasmapheresis period, the 
participant  will continue to be followed for  serious adverse events according to the study schedule.  
Participants  will be contacted by phone at Weeks 1, 4, and 10. At Week 26, participants will be queried  
for occur rence of serious adverse events  and serious  new onset chronic illnesses (NOCIs) , which will 
be recorded by the investigator (or designee ) on serious adverse events recording sheets and entered in 
the eCRF .  Vital signs will be  monitored at screen ing, Week 0 (vaccine visit),   and at each plasma 
collection visit.

1.1 BACKGROUND  
Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) ( BIG-IV; Baby BIG®) has been 
demonstrated to significantly shorten  hospital stay and improve outcomes  in infant 
botulism patients .  BabyBIG is currently produced from  antibodies collected from 
persons with existing botulinum immunity including individuals  previously 
immunized with investigational pentavalent botulinum toxoid (PBT) for 
occupational protection  and/or also boosted with investigational recombinant 
botulinum vaccine A/B (rBV A/B) .  
PBT was distributed through the C enter s for Disease Control and Pr evention  (CDC)  
under BB -IND-0161 for occupational safety .  The toxoid  was administered to naïve 
recipients  and was also  administered as a booster in persons who had been 
previously immunized .  PBT -immunized individuals  who have circulating 
antibodies against botulinum toxin t ype A and type B are eligible to donate plasma 
for manufacture of BabyBIG.  Donated plasma is fractionated and treated to yield 
a purified i mmunoglobulin G product that provides passive immunity  to patients 
with infant botulism.  
Howe ver, the CDC  no longer provides investigational PBT for immunization of 
laboratory workers at risk for occupational exposure to botulinum s erotypes A, B, 
C, D, and E.  Specifically, on the basis of  evidence of declining i mmunogenicity,  
increas ing reactogenicity,  and the age of the product, the CDC  ceased distribution 
of PBT after 30  November  2011.[1]  Thus, a new immunogen against botulinum 
toxins  is needed.   A  recombinant botulinum vaccine for the toxin serotypes A and 
B (rBV  A/B) has been developed  and is being proposed as a replacement vaccine 
for boosting participant s who previously received PBT for occupational protection.  
This study is the second phase 2 study under IND 15155 being conducted by the 
California Department of Public Health (CDPH) to determine if rBV A/B  will 
stimulate production of neutralizing antibodies against botulinum toxin types A and 
B in participant s previously immunized with PBT (or PBT and rBV A/B) .  
Participant s with a range in neutralizing antibody  titers against the toxin  types 
would be candidates  for plasma collection for BabyBIG  production under IND 
15155.

 Page 17 1.2 STUDY RATIONALE  
This protocol has as its ultimate goal the production of additional lots of  the 
approved orphan drug Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous ( Human ), (BIG-IV; 
BabyB IG®) for the treatment of infant botulism.  To enable production of BabyBIG, 
a group of high -titer immunized  persons are needed who are willing to donate th eir 
hyper immune plasma as a starting agent  (i.e., Source Plasma) for BabyBIG .  This 
protocol is designed  to determine botulinum toxin type A and type B neutralizing 
antibody levels in healthy participant s who were previously immunized with PBT 
(or PBT and rBV A/B) for occupational protection and who receive rBV  A/B (or 
rBV A/B boost) .  A Phase 2b study conducted by CDPH (rBV  A/B -CL-001) 
demonstrated a s ingle 40 -µg dose of rBV A/B was well tolerated and resulted in a 
significant increase in neutralizing antibodies against botulinum toxins type A and 
B in participants previously immunized with PBT. T he proposed study will 
continue to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a single dose of the  rBV A/B 
vaccine in this previously immunized population.   This study design is similar to 
rBV A/B -CL-001.  However, in this study a single 40 -µg dose of rBV  A/B will be 
used to stimulate the production of neutralizi ng antibodies against botulinum toxin 
type A and type B in participants that are rBV A/B naïve or in participants that 
volunteered for the rBV A/B -CL-001 clinical trial and received one dose of rBV 
A/B.  
1.3 DOSE RATIONALE  
An rBV A/B dose of 40 -µg of total anti gen (20-µg of Anti gen A and 20 -µg of 
Antigen B) with Alhydrogel ™ has been shown in P hase 1  and Phase 2 studies in 
healthy participant s to be effective in stimulating a  strong antibody response  and 
has an acceptable safety profile.  Most  treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs ) 
were mild and transient .  Furthermore, t he safety and immunogenicity of the 
rBV A/B vaccine in a naïve population was  investigated in 372 participant s using 
the same dose level and a three- dose schedule (under BB -IND 11756) .  A Phase 2b 
study  conducted by CDPH  (rBV A/B -CL-001) demonstrated a single 40- µg dose 
of rBV A/B was well tolerated , and no s afety concerns were identified during the 
study .  In addition, the single 40- µg dose resulted in a significant increase in 
neutralizing ant ibodies against botulinum toxin type s A and B in participants 
previously immunized with PBT.  Therefore, the  proposed dose in this study is 
expected to have an acceptable safety profile and be effective in stimulating

3.1 BASIC DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS  
This will be an open- label, uncontrolled st udy to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of a single intramuscular injection of 40- µg of rBV A/B in 
participants who were previously immunized with PBT  (or PBT  and rBV A/B) for 
occupational protection.  Participants will receive the rBV A/B injection, and may 
elect to undergo plasmapheresis at a maximum of two times per week up to 
12 weeks.  Participants can continue plasmapheresis up to 14 weeks as long as they 
continue to meet source plasma donor acceptance criteria.  Participants w ill be 
evaluated for safety and immunogenicity at each study visit with longer -term 
follow -up safety data collected at 6 months . 
The study period is defined as the 12 -week period that includes the clinic visits and 
plasmapheresis visits . The study period w ill end at Week 4 for participants who opt 
not to participate or who have been determined to be ineligible for donation for the 
entire study . Participants undergoing plasmapheresis will also have an additional 
hematology specimen collected at Week 4.  Stud y participants participating in 
plasma donations will have a final on -site study visit at Week 12. All participants 
will have a final phone call for safety follow -up at Week 26.

 Page 27 4.0 DRUGS AND DOSAGES  
4.1 IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPT ION OF INVESTIGATIONAL 
PRODUCT  
4.1.1 Investigational Product  
rBV A/B is manufactured by DynPort Vaccine Company LLC, a GDIT  Company  
(Fred erick, Maryland).  The procedure used to manufacture the active ingredient  of 
rBV A/B  is described below . 
The recombinant botulinum neurotoxin antigens are expressed from synthetic 
genes encoding the carboxy -terminal region of the botulinum neurotoxins ( BoNT) 
heavy -chains [rBoNT(H C)] of BoNT/A and BoNT/B, designated Antigen A and 
Antigen B.  These fragments are from the binding domain of the heavy -chain and 
do not have neurotoxic activity.  Antigen A and Antigen B are expressed in the 
methylotrop hic yeast Pichia pastoris  as 50  kDa and 52 kDa proteins, respectively.  
Antigen A is derived from the BoNT/A1 expressed by C lostridium  botulinum  strain 
NCTC 2916 (Group I, proteolytic), and Antigen B is derived from BoNT/B1 
expressed by C.   botulinum  strain Danish (Group I, proteolytic).  These proteins 
have been expressed individually by using a methanol induction system from 
synthetic genes introduced into P. pastoris .  The bulk antigens were manufactured 
at high purity (each antigen purified drug s ubstance is >95% pure), formulated and 
combined in a 1:1 ratio based on mass ( in micrograms ) to produce the final drug 
product . 
The formulation used for this study will have 40 micrograms (μg) total antigen 
(20 μg Antigen A and 20 μg Antigen B) with 100 mM  sodium chloride, 15 m M 
sodium phosphate, and 50 mM sodium acetate with Alhydrogel™ (0.2% weight 
per volume ) balanced to  a pH of 5.5 for a total dose volume of 0.5 mL.

Each vial in Lot D1200138 will be labeled as shown in Figure 1.  
Figure 1. Sample vial label .  
 
4.2 DOSING INSTRUCTIONS AND SCHEDULE  
Participant s will receive a 0.5 mL intramuscular  injection of rBV A/B in the deltoid 
muscle, preferably in the nondominant arm.  The injection will be administered  by 
the investigator or delegated site personnel.  Site personnel will document the time 
of the injection in the  electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  Each vial should be 
visually inspected for particulate matter, discoloration, signs of adulteration, or 
contamination  before administration .  If the product appears discolored or has 
visible particulate matter, it should not be use d and both the study monitor  and 
principal investigator should be notified.  If the investigational product in the vial 
is suspect,  it should not be dispensed or administered.  Instead, a new dose should 
be obtained, inspected, and the dose withdrawn  then administered.   The occurrence 
of such an even t should be recorded i n the ISF  (investigator site file) . 
Each vial will be prepared b y swirling gently immediately before use.  
Approximately 0.5 to 0.6 mL of investigational product will be drawn into a sterile, 
1 mL l atex-free tuberculin syringe (Becton Dickinson & Co.) or equivalent with a 
sterile, 21 -gauge, 1 -inch BD PrecisionGlide ™ Needle (Becton Dickinson & Co.) 
or equivalent.  To ensure a full dose is able to  be drawn from each vial, the vial may 
need to be inverted with the bevel of the needle inserted just above the rubber 
stopper.  The date, time, and administrator’s initials w ill be recorded in the 
participant ’s source record and on the Investigational Product Accountability Log 
upon administering the investigational product to the participant .  In addition, the

 Page 29 site of vaccination (e.g. , deltoid muscle of left arm) will be recorded in the 
participant ’s source medical record.  
4.3 STORAGE AND HANDLING OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
All vials will be stored at 2 °C to 8°C (35.6°F to 46.4°F) in a secure storage location .  
The refrigerator  temperature will be recorded continuously and monitored daily.  
The investigational product must not be frozen.  A copy of the temperature logs for 
the storage refrigerator must be filed in the site study files  to document appropriate 
storage conditions. 
The principal investigator must  ensure that accurate records of receipt of all 
vaccine, including date of receipt , are maintained throughout the study .  In addition, 
accurate reco rds must  be kept regarding  when and how much vaccine was used. 
Study personnel  must not destroy or throw away any vial of vaccine, including 
empty, damaged, or partially used ones.  At the completion of the study, to sat isfy 
regulato ry requirements regarding dr ug accountability, all vaccine will be 
reconciled and the study monitor w ill verify that the remaining vials have been 
either returned to designee as determined by the sponsor -investigator  or destroy ed 
following the sponsor -investigator ’s instructions . 
4.4 DOSE STOPPING RULES  
4.4.1 Individual Participant  Stopping Rules  
Because only one dose of vaccine is administered  per participant , there will be no 
individual participant  stopping rules to preclude further vaccination.  
Participants who develop a Grade 3 (or higher) immediate hypersensitivity reaction 
to the vaccine will be coun selled by the investigator that future exposure to rBV 
A/B would not be advisable.    
4.4.2 Study Stopping Rules  
For this study, the following are the dose stopping rules ; and, if they occur , all 
dosing will stop, the D SMB (Section  6.10) will convene , review the data collected , 
and make a recommendation for continued dosing.

queried  for at each study visit. Any concomitant medication used to treat a severe 
injection site or systemic reaction from Week 0 -1 as well as any SAEs or serious 
NOCIs throughout the study ( through Week 26)  will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Enrolled participant s should not  receive licensed preparations of botulinum toxin  A 
or B used to treat  spastic disorders because they are already immune to the 
therapeutic benefits.  
Enrolled participant s should not receive any additional vaccines during  the study  
period. For participants who  choose  to donate plasma, this will apply until their last 
plasma donation or at the Week 12 visit (whichever occurs last) .  
Participant s should not receive  prescription  immunosuppressive agents, including 
corticosteroids  (systemic and inhalational) , during the s tudy period .  For 
participants who choose  to donate plasma, this will apply until their last plasma 
donation or at the Week 12 visit (whichever occurs last) .  Intra -articular, bursal or

5.1 OVERVIEW : SCHEDULE OF TIME AND EVENTS  
For this clinical trial there is a  7-day screen ing period  (Days –7 to –1) in which 
participant  eligibility will be determined.  Participants will enter either a 4-week 
(non- plasma donors) or a  12-week (plasma donors) treatment period in which a 
single rBV A/B injection will be administered on Day 0 to stimulate the production 
of antibodies against botulinum toxin type  A and type B.  Participants  will be able 
to donate plasma starting 1 week after injection with rBV A/B at a frequency of up 
to two times a week , for up to 12 weeks with the possibility of extending the  
donation times up to 14 weeks  post-vaccination  in accord  with FDA  plasma 
donation regulations and guidelines .[2]  NAC sample collections  are required for all 
participants at Week 0  and Week  4.  NAC sample collection is required for plasma 
donors with each donated unit .  Safety assessments for non- plasma donors are 
scheduled on Week 0, Week 1 (by phone), and Week 4 ( final on- site visit).  Safety 
assessments for plasma donors are at Week 0 with  follow -up phone call s at Week s 
1, 4 and 10, and a final on -site study visit at Week 12 to assess general health status 
and query for the interim occurrence of any SAEs or NOCIs . All participants will 
have a final phone call for safety follow -up at Week 26.  Concomitant medications 
will be queried  for at each study visit. Any concomitant  medication used to treat a 
severe injection site o r systemic reaction from W eek 0 -1 as well as  any SAEs or 
serious NOCIs throughout the study will be recorded in the eCRF.

 Page 34 5.2 MEASUREMENTS AND EVALUATIONS  
This section details the visits that occur during the study  and the assessments that 
are conducted at each visit.  Details o f the assessment s performed during the study  
are provided at the visit at which they are first performed . 
NAC determinations will be performed  at Battelle Biomedical Research Center 
(Columbus, Ohio) using a fully validated mouse neutralization assay for all NAC 
determinations in the BabyBIG program.   
5.2.1 Screening Period ( between Day s –7 and –1)   
Before  the initiation of screening assessments, the participant  will be given a 
complete explanation of the purpose and evaluations of the study.  Subsequently, 
the participant  must sign and receive a copy of the institutional review board (IRB) 
approved ICF ( Section  9.1) that includes  authorization for use and disclosure of 
protected health information ( Section  9.1).  Once the ICF  has been obtained, the 
baseline screening assessment s will be performed and the eligibility of the 
participant  will be determined.   The participant  will be assigned a participant  
number once the ICF is signed.  A separate plasmapheresis ICF must be obtained 
for participants donating plasma. 
Screen ing must occur between 1 and 7 days before Visit 1  (i.e. Vaccination Visit 
[Day 0 ]).  The following evaluations will be performed to assess the participant ’s 
eligibility for the study :   
• Medical history  
• Physical examination , including  weight and height; head, eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat; respiratory;  cardiovascular; gastrointestinal; extremities; skin; 
neurologic and mental status  evaluation  
• Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate)  
• Urine pregnancy test  (If positive , perform  confirmatory blood test .) 
• Listing  of prior and current  medications  for past 60 days

 Page 41 6.0 PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
6.1 DEFINITION OF A S ERIOUS A DVERSE E VENT  
In this clinical trial, a serious adverse event is defined as an AE that  meets any of 
the following criteria : 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
The term life -threatening  in the definition of an SAE  refers to an event in which 
the participant  was at risk of death at the time of the event.   Life-threatening  
does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe.  
• Requires hospitalization or a prolongation of an existing hospitalization  
In general, hospitali zation signifies that the participant  has been detained at the 
hospital or emergency department for observation or treatment that would not 
have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting.   
Complications that occur during hospitalizat ion are AEs , but not necessarily 
SAEs .  An occurrence or complication that prolongs hospitalization is an SAE .  
When there is doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or was necessary, 
the AE should be considered an SAE .  Hospitalization for elective treatments 
of a preexisting condition that did not worsen from its original baseline  level  is 
not considered an S AE. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
This definition is not intended to include AEs of relatively minor medical 
significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza , or accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) that may interfere or 
prevent everyday life function s but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 CDPH  
 rBV A/B  
Clinical Protocol  IND 015155  
 
 
 Page 42 • Other important medical events  
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
reporting is appropriate  for other important medical events that may not result 
in death, be life  threatening, or require hospitalization but still may jeopardize 
the participant  or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  These events should also be considered 
serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias , or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitalization, or  development of drug dependency or drug abuse .  
An SAE requires additional  detailed reports and follow -up.  The content of these 
detailed reports must address the i nvestigator’s estimate of causality.  The  medical 
monitor will review the S AE to determine  if it is an expe cted SAE ( i.e., whether or 
not the S AE is identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the Investigator’s 
Brochure ).  
The investigator is responsible for performing periodic and specific assessments for 
SAEs at study visits.  The investigator and clinical staff will note all SAEs 
mentione d by the participant during and after administration of the investigational 
product until the end of the study.  All clinical complaints volunteered by, or 
elicited from, the participant during the study  will be recorded on the appropriate 
page of the sour ce documentation for the indicated study period.  Information 
related to serious adverse events will be recorded on the eCRF.  The participant will 
receive appropriate treatment guidance for any SAE that occurs.  
All SAEs judged to be clinically significant, including clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities, will be followed until resolution or considered stable by 
the investigator.  All SAEs will be summarized in the annual report or more 
frequently, if requested by the regulatory agency.  Serious a dverse events require 
special reporting in addition to documentation in the eCRF as described in Section 
6.2.   
6.2 RECORDING S ERIOUS A DVERSE E VENTS  
When an SAE occurs, the investigator is responsible for  review ing all 
documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostic reports) 
relevant to the event(s).  The investigator will record all relevant information about 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 CDPH  
 rBV A/B  
Clinical Protocol  IND 015155  
 
 
 Page 43 the SAE s on the  SAE page of the e CRF.  It is not acceptable for the investigator to 
send photocopies of the participant ’s medical  records in lieu of the proper ly 
complet ed SAE pages  of the e CRF .  These types of documents should not be sent 
unless they are specifically request ed by pharmacovigilance.  If this request occurs, 
all participant  identifiers  and protected health information will be blinded on the 
copies of the me dical records before  submission to the appropriate authorities . 
The inve stigator will also attempt to report a  diagnosis versus  signs, symptoms , or 
other clinical information  for the S AE.  The diagnosis, not the individual signs and 
symptoms, should be documented on the appropriate page of the e CRF as the SAE.  
In addition, SAEs need to be reported on the SAE report form . 
6.3 ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY  
The investigator will assess  the severity for ea ch SAE reported during the study.  
The assessment will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgment.   
The classifications in Table 2 should be used in assigning severity of each AE 
recorded in the eCRF.   Additional guidance is provided in Appendix B for specific 
AEs, laboratory abnormalities, and changes in vital signs. 
Table 2. Classification of AEs by Severity  
Severity  Definition  
Grade 1  
Mild  AE Transient or mild discomfort (<48 hours); no medical intervention or 
therapy required  
Grade 2  
Moderate  AE Mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed; 
no or minimal medical interven tion or therapy required  
Grade 3  
Severe  AE Marked limitation  in activity, some assistance usually required; 
medical inter vention or therapy required, hospitalization possible  
Grade 4  
Life-threatening AE or 
Death  Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; 
significant me dical intervention or therapy required, ho spitalization or 
hospice care probable  
AE = adverse event . 
 
 
Any SAE that changes in  severity during its course will be recorded in the eCRF 
at the highest level experienced by the participant . 
Severity of an AE is graded as follows: M ild, moderate, severe or life -threatening 
myocardial infarction.  An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused 
with an SAE.  An event  may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as 
a severe headache, but not be considered an SAE .  Both AEs and SAEs can be 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 CDPH  
 rBV A/B  
Clinical Protocol  IND 015155  
 
 
 Page 44 assessed as severe.  An AE is defined as serious when it meets one of the predefined 
outcomes as described in Section  6.1. 
6.4 ASSESSMENT OF CAUSALITY 
The investigator must  estimate  the relationship between the investigational product 
and the occurrence of each SAE by using his or her best clinical judgment .  
Elements to consider  include the history of the underlying disease, conc omitant 
therapy, other risk factors and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
investigational product.  The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s 
Brochure or product -labeling information for marketed products in estimating  the 
relationship . 
Because of reporting timelines, the investigator might have minimal information to 
include in the initial SAE report.   However, the investigator must always make an 
assessment of causality for every event prior to the transmission of the SAE  report .  
The investigator may change his or her opinion of the causality in light of follow -
up information, with subsequent amend ment of  the SAE report.  Causality 
assessment is one of the criteria used to determine regulatory reporting 
requirements and should not be left blank.   Table 3 provide s the definitions to use 
in the assessment.

 Page 46 6.5 EXPECTEDNESS OF A DVERSE E VENTS  
An expected AE is one that is consistent with  the known risk information described 
in the current Investigator ’s Brochure .  An AE is considered unexpected if it is not 
listed the in the Investigator’s Brochure or it is not listed  at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed .  This will be assessed by the medical monitor or 
sponsor -investigator  upon receipt of the initial AE report.  
6.6 ADVERSE EVENTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST  
Adverse events of special interest that are particularly specific to this study will be 
collected , assessed and recorded in the eCRF as an AE.  These events of special 
interest will be collected in addition to the SAEs described in Section 6.1 and 
include the following clinical situations  (see Section 3.3.2) : 
• Frequency of  injection site reactions and  systemic reactions  among the study 
participants  that are  assessed as  severe between Day 0 and 7  will be captured as 
an AE.  
• Clinically significant changes in hematology between screening and Week 4 
that are assessed as  severe will be captured as an AE.   
 
6.7 REPORTING OF  SERIOUS A DVERSE E VENTS  
Any SAE occurring  after the participant  has been vaccinated  with rBV A/B must 
be reported to the medical monitor and sponsor -investigator by phone, fax, or e -
mail within 24 hours of the time the i nvestigator becomes aware of the SAE   
(Table 4) .  Urgent reporting of SAEs is required for the following reasons : 
1. To enable the sponsor -investigator  to fulfill the reporting requirements to the 
appropriate regulatory authority  
2. To facilita te the sponsor -investigator ’s rapid dissemination of information 
about  SAEs to other i nvestigators or sites in a multicenter study  
3. To facilitate reporting unanticipated  and/or serious  problems involving risk to 
participant s to the IRB  within 48 hours .

NOT wait to receive additional information before notifying the DSMB of the SAE  
and completing the form.  The form will be updated when additional information 
is received.  
IND Safety Reports:  The investigator  will report a suspected adverse reaction that 
is both “serious” and “unexpected” to FDA in accordance with the timeframe 
outlined in 21 CFR  312.32.  FDA and all participating investigators will be notified 
of potentially serious risks identified from any source within 15 calendar days after 
the sponsor -investigator  receives the safety information and determines that it is 
reportable [21 CFR312.32 (c) (1)].  The sponsor -investigator  must also notify FDA 
of any unexpected fatal or life- threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as 
possible but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor -investigator ’s 
initial re ceipt of the information

 Page 48 6.8 FOLLOW -UP OF S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
All SAEs (as well as clinically significant changes in hematology that result in a 
severe or serious adverse event ) will be followed until the occurrence of one of the 
following : 
• The event r esolves. 
• The condition stabilizes . 
• The event is otherwise explained . 
• The participant  is lost to follow -up. 
The appropriate SAE report form  will be updated for SAEs only once the SAE  
resolve s, stabilizes, is otherwise explained, or the participant  is lost to fo llow-up.  
The investigator will also ensure that additional  updates include  any supplemental 
data that may explain causality of the event(s).  
New or updated information will be recorded on a copy of the initially  completed 
SAE report, with all the changes signed and dated by the investigator or designee.  
The updated SAE r eport will then be signed by the investigator and resubmitted to 
the DSMB as outlined in Table 4.  
6.9 INJECTION SITE  AND SYSTEMIC REACTIONS  
Commonly seen i njection site reactions for rBV  A/B are consistent with reactions 
in participant s vaccinated with other recombinant protein vaccines  that include 
Alhydrogel™.  The majority of reaction s at the injection site  seen to date with 
rBV A/B have been mild or moderate in severity and included erythema, pain, 
pruritus, and swelling.  Participant s will be actively monitored for localized and 
systemic reactions to the injections and an anaphylaxis (epinephrine) kit will be 
available at the time of injections.  
The definitions to  be used to determine severity of injection site reactions  are 
provided in Table 5.

PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION 
7.1 PARTICIPANT  DISCONT INUATION 
Participant s will be encourag ed to complete the study; however, they may 
voluntarily withdraw at any time.  The investigator will provide a written 
explanation of the reason for discontinuation in a source document, which will be 
transcribed to the appropriate e CRF page.  If a partici pant withdraws before 
completion, every effort should be made to complete the assessments scheduled 
during the final on -site study visit.  In addition, the participant  will be offered safety 
follow -up for the planned duration of the study (through the Week  26 telephone 
contact) regardless of the reason for discontinuation.  
A participant may be removed from the study for t he reasons described in 
Section  7.1.1 through Section 7.1.5. 
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
If a participant  suffers an AE that, in the judgment of the investigator, the 
sponsor -investigator , or the medical monitor, presents an unacceptable 
consequence or risk to the participant , the participant  may be discontinued from the 
study.   
7.1.2 Intercurrent Illness  
A partic ipant  may be discontinued from the study if, in the judgment of the 
investigator, the participant develops an intercurrent illness or complication that is 
not consistent with the protocol requirements or that, in any way, justifies 
withdrawal from the stud y. 
7.1.3 Noncompliance  
After consultation among  the investigator, the medical monitor, and  study /data  
monitor, a participant  may be discontinued from the study for failure to comply 
with protocol requirements.  Upon being discontinued from the study, the

7.2 PREMATURE STUDY OR SITE TERMINATION 
If the sponsor , investigator, medical monitor, study/data  monitor, or appropriate 
regulatory officials discover conditions arising during the study  that indicate that 
the study should be halted or that the site  should be terminated, this action may be 
taken after appropriate consultation among the sponsor -investigator, medical 
monitor , and study/data  monitor.  Conditions that may warrant termination of the 
study include, but  are not limited to , the following:  
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the participant s 
enrolled in the study  
• A decision on the part of the sponsor -investigator  or product manufacturer to 
suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or development of the product  
A study conducted at a single site in a multicenter study may also warrant 
termination under the following conditions:  
• Failure of the i nvestigator to enroll participant s into the study at an acceptable 
rate 
• Failure of the i nvestigator to comply with pertin ent regulations of appropriate 
regulatory authorities

 Page 54 8.0 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING AND STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS  
8.1 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING  
eCRFs will be used  to capture study assessments and data.  The study investigator 
or other delegated study personnel will enter data from source documents into the 
eCRFs.  All eCRFs and their data will be reviewed and source verified by the 
study /data  monitor . The medical monitor may examine the eCRFs for preliminary 
medical review.  Once the eCRFs are completed and source -verified, the study 
investigator will sign and date all required pages, thereby verifying the accuracy of 
all data contained in the eCRF s. 
8.2 STA TISTICAL ANALYSIS  
8.2.1 General Overview  
The data will be summarized in tables listing the mean, standard deviation or 
standard error, median, minimum, maximum and number of participant s for 
continuous data or in tables listing count and percentage for categoric al data, where 
appropriate.  Data will be listed by  “participant ID .”  All statistical analyses will be 
performed and data appendices will be created by using SAS.   
8.2.2 Populations of Interest  
8.2.2.1 Immunogenicity Population  
The immun ogenicity  population defines  participant s who have received the vaccine 
dose, have a baseline NAC,  and have at least one post -vaccination immunogenicity 
assessment up to and including 4 weeks after administration of rBV  A/B. 
8.2.2.2 Per Protocol Population  
The per protocol population defines participant s who have received the vaccine 
dose, have a baseline NAC, and have the relevant immunogenicity assessments 
completed within the protocol -specified timelines (including visit windows)  for the 
time point(s) summarized and who do not have major pr otocol violations  expected 
to affect immunogenicity .  Determination of a major protocol violation expected to 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 CDPH

Clinical Protocol  IND 015155  
 
 
 Page 55 affect immunogenicity will be done by the sponsor -investigator  before reviewing 
the immunogenicity data for the applicable participant .  The preci se reasons for 
excluding participant s from the  per protocol  population will be fully defined and 
documented.  (Note:  It is possible for a participant to be included in the primary 
per protocol analysis for Week 4, even if the subsequent blood draws occur  outside 
of the study window s.) 
8.2.2.3 Safety Population  
The s afety population comprise s all participant s enrolled into the study who 
received  the vaccine dose  and had at least one post -baseline safety assessment (this 
assessment can include a response from a participant  that no adve rse events 
occurred) .  
8.2.2.4 Plasma -Donating Population  
The plasma- donating population will include all participants who receive the 
vaccine and donate at least one plasma unit.  
8.2.3 Baseline  Comparability 
No formal baseline comparability testing is planned for this study.  
8.2.4 Immunogeni city Analysis  
The immunogenicity population will be used for all immunogenicity  endpoints. 
The per protocol population will be used in the case that any sensitivity analyses 
are deemed necessary.    
The immuno genicity parameter s are concentration s of neutralizing antibodies 
against  botulinum  toxin type A and toxin type B.  These parameter s will be 
analyzed by using  NAC data from a validated mouse neutralization a ssay.  
For the primary endpoint, a positive response will be defined as achieving a greater 
than or equal to four times increase (point estimate)  above baseline  in NAC  by 
Week  4 compared with Week 0 in at least 50% of the participant s in the 
immunogenicity  population for botulinum toxin  type A and type B, respectively.   
CONFIDENTIAL

 rBV A/B  
Clinical Protocol  IND 015155  
 
 
 Page 56 A point estimate and two-sided 95% confidence interval for the proportion of 
participant s who achieve this endpoint will be provided. 
For the first secondary  immunogenicity  endpoint, a positive response will be 
defined as achieving a two times increase above baseline  in the estimated area under 
the plasma NAC -time curve in the period from W eek 0 to Week 12 in comparison 
to straight- line extension of the Week 0 antibody concentration from Week 0 to 
Week 12 in least 50% of the participant s.   
For the second secondary immunogenicity endpoint, a positive response will be 
defined as  is achieving a three times or gr eater increase in NAC  above baseline  by 
Week 4 in at least 50% of the participant s for botulinum toxin type A and type B .  
A point esti mate and two-sided 95% confidence interval for the proportion of 
participant s who achieve this endpoint will be provided. 
Further details of the analysis , will be provided as needed in a separate statistical 
analysis plan . 
In the event that the primary endpoint is not met for  neutralizing antibodies against  
botulinum toxin t ype A and type  B, the sponsor -investigator  will determine if the 
plasma collected during the study  contains sufficient antibody titers for meeting 
specifications for BabyBIG production.  If the immune responses meet 
specifications to permit the production of BabyBIG , then the trial will still be 
considered successful.  Also, a second booster dose of rBV  A/B vaccine may be 
considered ; however, this will require operational modifications (e.g., a protocol 
amendment and updated consent form).  
8.2.5 Safety Analysis  
The safety analysis will use the safety population.  
Localized and systemic severe AEs and SAEs collected from the Week 1 telephone 
call will be summarized  by category and severity.  A po int estimate of incidence, 
with 95% confidence limits will be computed and reported (not coded into the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [ MedDRA ] terminology or assessed 
for relatedness) .  The time period summarized will include  throughout the study  as 
a whole  and again within Days 0 through 7.  For tables summarizing severit y, the

 CDPH  
 rBV A/B  
Clinical Protocol  IND 015155  
 
 
 Page 57 highest reported severity grade will be used.  In addition, the average duration, by 
category, will be summarized . 
All other S AE data will be listed individually and summarized by system organ 
class and preferred terms for each treatment group.  When calculating the incidence 
of SAEs, each S AE based on preferred terminology from MedDRA  will be counted 
only once for a given participant .  If the same S AE occurs on multiple occasions  in 
a participant , the occurrence with the highest severity and highest causality 
relationship to the vaccine will be reported .  If two or more S AEs are reported as a 
unit, the individual terms will be reported as separate experiences.  
Treatment -emergent abnormal values that occur prior to the end of the study  will 
be summarized.  Laboratory abnormalities will be assessed for relatedness.  
Treatment -emergent changes from normal to abnormal values in key laboratory 
parameters will be identified . 
Presentation of relatedness in tables will be based o n the investigator’s assessment.  
8.2.6 Sample Size  
No formal power calculations will be performed for this study.  The sample size 
will consist of up to 50 participant s.  On the basis of prior sponsor -investigator  
experience, this sample size is considered adequate for fulfilling the study 
objectives.

§ 640.63 Suitability of donor.   
(a) Method of determining. The suitability of a donor for Source Plasma will be determined 
by a qualified licensed physician or by persons under his  or her  supervision and trained 
in determining donor suitability. Such determination will be made on the day of 
collection from the donor by means of a medical history, tests, and such physical 
examination as appears necessary to the qualified licensed physician.  
(b) Initial medical examinations.  
(1) Each donor will be examined by a qualified  licensed physician on the day of the 
first donation or no more than 1 week before the first donation and at subsequent 
intervals of no longer than 1 year.  
(2)  
(i) A donor who is to be immunized for the production of high -titer plasma 
will be examined by a qualified licensed physician. The medical 
examination will be performed within no more than 1 week before the first 
immunization injection. The medical examination for plasmapheresis need 
not be repeated, if the first donation occurs within 3 weeks after  the first 
injection.  
(ii) A donor who is an active participant in a plasmapheresis program, and has 
been examined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, need 
not be reexamined before immunization for the production of high- titer 
plasma.  
(3) Each donor will be certified to be in good health by the examining physician. The 
certification of good health will be on a form supplied by the licensed 
establishment and will indicate that the certification applies to the suitability of 
the individual to  be a plasmapheresis donor and, when applicable, an immunized 
donor.

 Schema  
This Phase II placebo- controlled study will enroll 468 subjects to evaluate the effect of l isinopril or Coreg 
CR® , compared to placebo, on trastuzumab- induced cardiotoxicity in patients with breast cancer who are 
receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy.   The study will enroll to 2 separate cohorts; patients who 
received an anthracycline- containing regimen and pati ents whose treatment regimen did not contain an 
anthracycline. Should accrual to a cohort reach 281, that cohort will be closed to new accrual and the study will be completed with accrual to the remaining cohort.  Study agent will be administered daily for  
52 weeks OR until the end of trastuzumab therapy, if it is discontinued prior to week 52.  Primary 
response, change in LVEF, will be evaluated at baseline, every 3 months X 4  while on trastuzumab 
therapy,  then at study months 18 and 24 (or 6 and 12 months after last dose of trastuzumab).  Study 
failure is defined as an absolute decrease ≥ 10% in LVEF at study follow -up OR an absolute decrease ≥  
5% in LVEF if it is < 50% at study follow -up.

 1.0  Introduction   
1.1 Chemotherapy -induced cardiotoxicity is a well -established treatment side effect, most 
notably of anthracyclin e-based treatment regimens.  It is also a side effect of trastuzumab 
(Herceptin ®), which is now standard in adjuvant treatment regimens for women with 
human epidermal growth factor - 2 (HER2 ) positive breast  cancers .  The projected number 
of women who will have HER2- positive disease and who can benefit from trastuzumab 
therapy, well exceeds 50,000 per year 
1.2 A decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) has been reported in as many as 28-
34% of women when trastuzumab is combined with standard chemotherapy.1-3  As new 
agents are introduced into clinical practice and treatment outcomes improve, there will be 
more long- term survivors  of breast cancer.  As the number of survivors increases, it is 
likely that treatment -induced cardiotoxicity will be more prevalent.  
1.3 One of the new challenges in oncology and cardiology is safe and effective short and long-
term use of trastuzumab.  In addition to improving progression- free survival in women with                                                                                                                                                                 
metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2, trastuzumab also has been shown to 
reduce the risk of recurrence in the adjuvant setting for early stage breast cancers that are 
HER2 -positive.4    
1.4 Trastuzumab is the prototype of novel targeted molecular chemotherapeutic agents. HER2 
is amplified or overexpressed in up to 30% of breast cancers5 and is also expressed in 
myocardial cells.6  Inhibition of signaling through the myocardial receptor may cause 
cardiotoxicity secondary to disrupted cardiac contractile function and structure6, especially 
in the previously stressed heart; however, the exact mechanism of cardiotoxicity is under 
intense investigation.  
1.5 While studies have demonstrated improved disease- specific and overall survival in                                                                                                                                                    
patients with HER2 overexpressing disease, treated with trastuzumab,5, 7 oncologists 
commonly interrupt or discontinue trastuzumab therapy when there is  evidence of 
cardiotoxic changes.  Cardiotoxicity is commonly manifested by an asymptomatic 
decrease in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and less commonly by clinical 
heart failure.3  Unlike anthracycline- induced cardiotoxicity, trastuzumab- induced changes 
are not dose- dependent,3 and may be substantially reversible,3,8 despite continuation of 
trastuzumab in the face of cardiotoxic changes or a subsequent drug rechallenge.9  
Endomyocardial biopsies from patients with trastuzumab- induced cardiac dysfunction also 
do not have the typical anthracycline- related ultrastructural changes.10, 11  Evidence has 
suggested that LVEF recovery is evident within six months of discontinuing trastuzumab 
therapy for the majority of patients who demonstrate a decrease in LVEF.12  However, the 
data on long- term sequelae of these changes are still being gathered.   
1.6 Cardiac side effects of trastuzumab have, like anthracycline therapy, prompted mandatory 
screening practices before and during treatment with trastuzumab.  Evaluation of LVEF is 
the most common screening procedure conducted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
1.7 Due to the recognition of increased cardiac toxicity observed with anthracyclines and 
trastuzumab combinations, there has been much emphasis on finding alternative 
treatment s that will reduce the incidence of cardiotox icity.  Even with changes in breast 
cancer treatment regimens that may reduce its prevalence, cardiotoxicity will remain a 
concern for oncologists.      
1.8 Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of  angiotensin- converting enzyme 
(ACE)  inhibitors and  beta blockers  (β-blockers ) in preventing anthracycline- induced 
cardiotoxicity.13, 14  The majority of patients who develop trastuzumab- induced 
cardiotoxicity respond to standard treatment for chronic heart failure, which usually 
consists of diuretics, ACE inhibitors, β -blockers, cardiac glycosides and other inotropic 
agents.2, 3  Optimal treatment of these patients includes identification of individuals at risk 
for and the prevention of cardiotoxicity, as well as early diagnosis and effective treatment of cardiotoxic changes.

 1.9 This is  a randomized, phase II placebo- control led trial evaluating the effects of an ACE 
inhibitor (lisinopril) and a β -blocker Coreg CR®  on cardiotoxicity in patients with breast 
cancer who are receiving adjuvant trastuzumab. If we can demonstrate that the use of an 
ACE inhibitor or a β -blocker  can r educe the degree of trastuzumab- induced cardiotoxicity,  
it is hoped that patients will receive complete and uninterrupted therapy for breast cancer.   
 
2.0 Background and Significance    
2.1 The clinical significance of cardiotoxicity associated with trastuzumab is acknowledged as 
a serious concern within the oncology community.  While a recent review reported the 
incidence of trastuzumab- induced cardiotoxicity to range from 6.5% to 34%,2 large 
adjuvant trastuzumab trials (NSABP B -31, BCIRG 006, HERA, NCCTG N9831. FinHER) 
report the incidence to range from 0- 17%.15  The variation in incidence within studies is a 
result of inconsistent definitions and measurements of cardiotoxicity.  It also  depends on 
whether trastuzumab was used in a treatment or adjuvant setting; with higher incidence in 
patients receiving concurrent anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC).  Based on these 
past studies and anecdotal clinical experience, a conservative inci dence estimate of 
cardiotoxicity in our study population is approximately 15%.    
2.2 To further assess trastuzumab- induced cardiotoxicities, the study co -chair (Dr. Guglin, 
Cardiologist) conducted a retrospective study at the H. Lee SunCoast  Cancer Center in 
Tampa, Florida in patients receiving trastuzumab therapy for breast cancer in two settings 
(adjuvant n = 118; metastatic n = 38) .2  Patients in the adjuvant group receiving 
concomitant cardiac medications, including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, 
statins , and β-blockers, were more likely to receive uninterrupted trastuzumab therapy (p = 
0.0335), had less change in ejection fraction (p = .0083), and had fewer symptoms of 
heart fai lure (p = 0.0083).  Adjuvant patients who were receiving these medications for 
hypertension alone had significantly less cardiotoxicity (p = .0063), less change in ejection 
fraction (p = 0 .0466) , and fewer symptoms of heart failure (p= .0466).  This was le ss 
evident in patients with one or more co- morbidities  aside from hypertension alone (p = 
0.0915).   In the adjuvant group, cardiotoxicity was observed in one- third of patients (n=39) 
evaluated.    Seventeen patients (14.4%) demonstrated a decrease in ejecti on fraction to <  
50%.  Of these, only seven patients exhibited signs and symptoms of heart 
failure.  Nineteen patients (16.1%) exhibited a decline in ejection fraction by ≥  10% during 
trastuzumab therapy; however, none of these patients were symptomatic. Three patients 
had signs and symptoms heart failure in the presence of normal systolic function.  Data 
from the metastatic group were less consistent.   Of the 38 patients, 34.2% developed 
cardiotoxicities.   Two of the patients initiated trastuzumab with a baseline EF of 48% and 
30%.   
2.3 The exact mechanism of trastuzumab- induced cardiotoxicity has yet to be elucidated.  
Several hypotheses have been proposed, including; inhibition of HER2 signaling in cardiac 
tissues, drug- drug interactions, an induction of immune mediated destruction of 
cardiomyocytes , and indirect consequences of trastuzumab- induced affects outside of the 
heart.16-18  In a recent study by Grazette et. al ., cultures of neonatal rat ventricular 
myocytes were exposed to anti -erbB2 (HER2) antibody.19  There was a time- dependent 
increase in mitochondrial translocation and oligomerization of Bcl -associated protein, as 
indica ted by 1,6- bismaleimidohexane cross linking.  This process was associated with 
cytochrome C release and caspase activation.  These alterations induced mitochondrial dysfunction, a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, a 35% decline in adenosine 
triphos phate levels , and a loss of redox capacity.  Anti -erbB2 activates the mitochondrial 
apoptosis pathway through a modulation of Bcl -xL and -xS, which  was previously not 
described , causing impairment of mitochondrial function and integrity , and disruption of 
cellular energetics.  Evidence also supports a direct cardiotoxic effect of HER2 blockade.  
Mice were generated with ventricular -restricted knockout of the HER2 gene.
17  These mice 
developed signs of a dilated cardiomyopathy, and their cardiomyocytes showed enhanced 
susceptibility to anthracycline- induced cell death.  Thereby concluding that the signaling 
  SCUSF  0806

(Amendment #5)  
Page 3 of 32 
 cascade associated with HER2 in cardiomyocytes is essential for the prevention of dilated 
cardiomyopathy.  This data provides evidence that the cardiotoxicity induced from 
exposure to trastuzumab is presumably due to its direct effects on the HER2 receptor.  
2.4 There are strong indicators from existing literature and in related topics that  suggests how 
ACE inhibitors and β -blockers might effectively reduce trastuzumab- induced cardiotoxicity.  
2.5 Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)  Inhibitors : 
2.5.1  Angiot ensin converting enzyme  (ACE) inhibitors are a standard therapy for heart 
failure (HF) and asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, regardless of etiology.
20  Multiple, large, prospective, randomized trials have 
consistently demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality and morbidity aft er 
therapy with ACE inhibitors.21, 22   Further, t he use of ACE inhibitors in the 
treatment of trastuzumab- induced cardiotoxicity was obs erved in the 
retrospective data collected by the s tudy co-chair with promising result s.2  The 
exact mechanism of action in this treatment setting is not clearly understood, but several explanations have been suggested.  The primary effect includes  the 
limiting of oxidative stress, largely mediated through angiotensin II suppression.
23  In addition to interrupting the renin- angiotensin system, ACE 
inhibitors also  enhance the action of kinins and augments kinin- mediated 
prostaglandin production.24    
2.5.2  ACE inhibitors are an important class of agents that have multiple benefits in the 
treatment, as well as prevention,  of heart failure in susceptible populations.  The 
benefits are a class effect, as the same benefits have been demonstrated in 
many agents of this class.  We chose lisinopril for this study because it has been 
shown to be superior to alternative ACE inhib itors in this regard.25, 26   
2.5.3  The efficacy of ACE inhibitors in patients with asymptomatic LV dysfunction was 
demonstrated in the SOLVD27 prevention and the SAVE22 trials .  The Studies of 
Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) prevention trial included 4,228 patients 
with asymptomatic LV dysfunction with an LVEF ≤ 35%.  The combined 
incidence of symptomatic HF or cardiovascular death was reduced by enalapril  
(30% versus 39% for placebo) and the risk reduction of 29% (95% CI 21% to 36 
%, p < 0.001) was demonstrated with a mean follow -up of just over three years.  
In the XSOLVD, extension of the SOLVD prevention trial, there were significant reductions in all -cause mortality (51% versus 56% for placebo, p = 0.001) and 
cardiovascular mortality (37% versus 42% for placebo, p = 0.0008) at 11 years.
21 
2.5.4  The Survival and Ventricula r Enlargement (SAVE) trial demonstrated that when 
administered 3 to 16 days after acute myocardial infarction in select patients, captopril (an ACE  inhibitor) led to a reduction in risk of 21% for death from 
cardiovascular causes (95% confidence interval, 5% to 35%; p = 0.014).  It also 
led to a 37% risk reduction for the development of severe HF (95% confidence interval, 20% to 50%; p < 0.001).
22  
2.5.5  The analysis of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial 
suggests that 10 mg daily ramipril therapy may reduce the risk of developing HF 
in high -risk patients without LV dysfunction.28  Two prospectively defined 
endpoints (HF death and HF hospitalization) were combined with two post hoc endpoints (HF leading to open label ACE inhibitor use or development of signs 
and symptoms of HF).  Ramipril significantly reduced the event rate from 11.5% 
to 9.0% (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.87, p < 0.0001).  
2.5.6  Studies have evaluated the effect of ACE inhibitors in anthracycline induced-
cardiotoxicity.  The value of treatment with ACE inhibitors was demonstrated in a 
prospective series of patients who were being monitored for evidence of LV dysfunction while on epirubicin for metastatic breast cancer.
29  In contrast, there 
was only one such response among 33 cases treated with a digitalis preparation 
  SCUSF  0806

(Amendment #5)

 plus a diuretic.  Seven of eight (88%) patients treated with an ACE inhibitor had 
a sustained increase in LVEF of ≥ 15% as compared to one of 33 (8%) in those 
who were not treated with an ACE inhibitor (p < 0.001).  The patients with 
decreased cardiac function did not spontaneously recover d uring the observation 
period.  Cardiac  function could only be reversed by treatment with ACE inhibitors  
for several months.  Three patients in this study stopped ACE inhibition therapy 
after years of stabilized cardiac function, after which all three experienced a 
deterioration of cardiac function.  Sixty additional patients with severe HF from 
anthracyclines have since been successfully treated with ACE inhibition, with a 
remarkably long- lasting rec overy evaluated clinically and by LVEF 
determination.29   
2.5.7  The potential protective effect of ACE inhibitors for preventing the development 
of left ventricular dysfunction in response to chemotherapy has since been 
evaluated.  Cardinale, et. al ., report a randomized trial of patients after high- dose 
chemotherapy.13  One hundred fourteen adult patients who had elevated 
troponin- I soon after  high-dose chemotherapy  were randomized to enalapril 
(target of 20 mg/day) or o pen-label  control, with treatment initiation delayed until 
one month after  chemotherapy and continued for one year.  The results were 
impressive;  43% of the control and 0% in the enalapril  group had a more than 
10% drop in LVEF (p < 0.001), and clinical cardiac events were likewise nearly 
eliminated with enalapril, from 30 events in the control population to  one event in 
the enalapril group (p < 0.001).  This was primar ily attributable to reductions  in 
heart failure and arrhythmias.  There were some weaknesses in the trial  such as 
the trial was a single- center,  open- label trial, the diversity of cancer diagnoses 
and chemotherapy regimens included in the study, and possible bias because of 
the lack of pre- specified and clearly defined clinical endpoints.  
2.5.8  A study conducted by Silber et. al ., evaluated the use of enalapril in 135 pediatric 
cases who already had one anthracycline- induced cardiac abnormality.30  
Treatment with enalapril demonstrated that during the first year of treatment, the 
rate of reduction in LV end- systolic wall stress was greater in the enalapril group 
than in the placebo group ( -8.59 versus 1.85 g/cm2; p = 0.033).  This difference 
was maintained over the study period, resulting in a 9% reduction in estimated 
LV en d-systolic wall stress by year five  in the enalapril group.  There was no 
change in the functional capacity.  
2.5.9  An animal study conducted by Boucek et. al ., demonstrated that treatment with 
an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril, reduces the time- dependent effects of an 
anthracycline on cardiac gene expression and myocellular apoptosis.31  Rabbits 
were randomized to one of four treatment groups; saline (control) +/ - lisinopril or 
anthracycline +/ - lisinopril.  After a 10- week intervention, histopathology 
demonstrated a reduced number of cardiomyocytes relative to interstitial cells in 
the LV of the anthracycline treated group compared to the control and the 
anthracycline + lisinopril groups.  Gene expression of the pro- atrial n aturetic 
peptide (ANP) increased approximately 12- fold (n = 10; p < 0.05) in the LV of the 
anthracycline treated group compared to the control and anthracycline + lisinopril 
groups.  
2.6 Beta Blockers ( β-Blockers ): 
2.6.1  The increase of sympathetic activity in HF may  have deleterious effects.  A 
number of trials have shown that blockade of β -adrenergic receptors leads to 
symptomatic improvement and enhanced survival in many patients with HF.32  
The use of β -blockers has consistently been associated with a 30% reduction in 
mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalization in patients with HF.33-37  As a 
result of this compelling evidence, β -blockers are now considered an important 
component of standard therapy in HF.  β -blockers primar ily act to inhibit the 
  SCUSF  0806  
Protocol Act V6.0 August  31, 2012  
(Amendment #5)  
Page 5 of 32 
 adverse effects of the sympathetic nervous systems in patients with HF.24  β-
Blockers also reduce cardiotoxicities by preventing free radical mediated lipid 
oxidation and intracellular calcium  overload.      
2.6.2  The MERIT -HF trial38 and t he RESOLVD pilot study39 demonstrated that the use 
of sustai ned release metoprolol has a mortality benefit.  In the Metoprolol CR/XL 
Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT -HF), 3,991 
patients with class II to IV HF and an LVEF ≤ 40% who were receiving any combination of diuretic and ACE in hibitor, were randomly assigned to therapy 
with extended- release metoprolol, beginning with 12.5 or 25 mg daily and titrated 
up to 200 mg/day, or placebo.  The study was terminated early when it showed a 34% relative risk reduction in all -cause mortality at 12 months (7.2% versus 11% 
for placebo, p = 0.0062).  There was also a reduction in cardiovascular deaths in the metoprolol group, (6.4% versus 10.1%; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50- 0.78, p = 
0.00003) and deaths from aggravated HF (1.5% versus 2.9%; RR 0.51, 95% C I 
0.33- 0.79, p = 0.0023).  The total risk reduction of deaths related to 
cardiovascular and aggravated HF was 38% and 49%, respectively.  While the 
proportion of sudden cardiac deaths decreased, when grouped by the New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) functio nal class, a greater proportion of deaths were 
observed in subjects who exhibited increasing severity of HF.  The study agent was well tolerated.  
2.6.3  In the Randomized Evaluation of Strategies for Left Ventricular Dysfunction pilot 
trial (RESOLVD ) study metoprolol CR showed a significant improvement in 
measures of  LV function with an attenuation in the increase in LV end- diastolic  
volume (+6±61 mL versus +23±65 mL, p = 0.01)  and LV end- systolic volume ( -
2±51 mL versus +19±55 mL, p < 0.001) after 24 weeks of therapy.
39  LVEF was 
unchanged ( -0.05%) in the placebo gr oup but increased by 2.4% in the 
metoprolol CR –treated patients ( p = 0.001).  There were fewer deaths  in the 
group receiving β -blockers (3.4% versus 8.1%, not significant).  
2.6.4  Animal studies have suggested that the β -blocker, Coreg CR®, may protect 
against th e cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines.40  Further support for this possibility 
comes from a small randomized trial of 50 patients undergoing anthracycline 
chemotherapy for a variety of malignancies.14  Patients were randomly assigned 
to carvedilol, 12.5 mg daily, or placebo.  All patients underwent 
echocardiography prior to and six months after chemotherapy.  Among the patients assigned to carvedilol, there was no change in the mean LVEF after chemotherapy (70% before and after therapy) .  In contrast, patients assigned to 
placebo had a statistically significant absolute reduction in LVEF by 17 % (69 to 
52%, p < 0.001).  The incidence of cardiotoxicity observed was unusually large 
(20%) in the control group as compared to 4% in the treatment group, which may 
be from the high doses of anthracycline used in the study for both groups.  
However the standard deviation of the doses was not reported and it could 
greatly affect the significance of the study.   
2.6.5  Several studies have been completed comparing the efficacy of various β -
blockers.
41-47  Use of carvedilol is associated with a greater improvement of 
LVEF, long er estimated median survival, a reduction in the total number of 
hospitalizations , and hospitalizations for cardiovascular reasons and those for 
HF.   
2.6.6  Coreg CR® is a nonselective beta- adrenergic blocking agent approved to treat 
essential hypertension, impaired left ventricular function related to acute 
myocardial infarction,  and heart failure.   Coreg CR® is indicated for the 
treatment of mild- to-severe congestive heart failure of ischemic or 
cardiomyopathic origin.   It has been shown to reduce symptoms and clinical 
progression of heart failure45, 48 and to improve left ventricular function.49 The 
  SCUSF  0806  
Protocol Act V6.0 August  31, 2012  
(Amendment #5)  
Page 6 of 32 
 mechanism by which Coreg CR®  produces a beneficial effect in patients with 
congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction following an acute 
myocardial infarction is not known ( Prod Info Coreg CR® (carvedilol phosphate, 
extended- release) oral capsules, 2006).   
2.6.7  In a retrospective study, M. Guglin et al. demonstrated that being on cardiac 
medications thought to prevent cardiac remodeling (ACE -inhibitors, angiotensin 
receptor block ers, statins, beta -blockers) was possibly associated with less 
cardiomyopathy (RR=0.69; p 0.092) and less HF symptoms (RR=0.38; p 0.086) in adjuvant patients with one or more cardiovascular comorbidities. The use of 
these medications was significantly associated with less cardiomyopathy 
(RR=0.35; p = 0.0063), less EF drop <  50% (RR=0.13; p 0.0083), less heart 
failure symptoms (RR=0.13; p =  0.0083), and less trastuzumab discontinuation 
(RR=0.25; p = 0.034) in adjuvant patients with hypertension alone.
2 
2.7 Using the same strategies  that have  demonstrated promising results in anthracycline-
induced cardiotoxicity, this study will evaluate and compare the effect of an ACE inhibitor, 
lisinopril, and a β -blocker, Coreg CR® , on trastuzumab- induced cardiotoxicity in women 
with breast cancer.  Participants will start study agent at the same time as they start 
trastuzumab treatment and continue on study agent for 52 weeks (or end of trastuzumab if 
it is discontinued prior t o week 52) . The efficacy of ACE inhibitors and β -blockers in the 
treatment of chemotherapy -induced cardiotoxicity, specifically LVEF, are equivalent.  
Therefore, a study to compare the efficacy of these agents is warranted.  Should either 
intervention prove effective,  fewer patients will experience the deleterious effects of 
cardiotoxicity; and, more patients will be able to complete optimal therapy for breast cancer 
treatment.   
2.8 Measurement of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF):  
2.8.1  Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scans and echocardiograms (ECHO) are 
routinely used to monitor and assess cardiac function and LVEF of patients with 
cancer who are treated with cardiotoxic -inducing chemotherapeutic agents.  
LVEF provides an overall  assessment of  cardiac function, and is a measure of 
the proportion of blood that is expelled from the ventricle with each heartbeat . 
2.8.2  A MUGA is a noninvasive assessment that produces a moving image of the heart, which can accurately assess the activity of the le ft ventricle and provides a 
reproducible measure of LVEF.  The MUGA scan involves the introduction of a 
radioactive marker into the bloodstream, which can be scanned to determine the 
circulation dynamics of the marker and blood flow.  
2.8.3  An ECHO  is a noninvasive ultrasound assessment of sound waves to examine 
the structure and motion of the heart.  It provides a real -time image of the heart 
and can produce accurate assessments of the velocity of the blood and cardiac 
tissues, as well as calculate  cardiac output and EF.   
2.8.4  Ejection fraction will be assessed at baseline, every  3 months (+/- 2 weeks ) 
through study week 52, (or until the end of trastuzumab, if discontinued prior to 
week 52) and at study month 18 and 24 (or 6 and 12 months after the last dose 
of trastuzumab, if it was discontinued prior to study week 52).    
 
2.9 Biomarkers of cardiotoxi city will be evaluated in an effort to identify patients at risk for 
cardiomyopathy prior to development of cardiac symptoms and before the drop of ejection 
fraction (EF) can be appreciated by echocardiography or MUGA.   
 Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)  
2.9.1  Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)  concentration is a measurement of the amount of 
BNP hormone in the blood and is an indicator of heart function.  Normal levels of BNP are low (0- 99 pg/mL) and the concentration increases as a consequence of 10/08/2010  
 
6/3/2011  
  SCUSF  0806  
Protocol Act V6.0 August  31, 2012  
(Amendment #5)  
Page 7 of 32 
 HF severity (≥ 100 pg/mL).  The concentration of BNP is also used to measure 
the response to treatment for HF.  Monitoring BNP has been demonstrated to 
measure changes of heart function during and after trastuzumab treatment.50, 51  
The concentration of BNP will b e assessed at baseline and compared every 3 
months (+/ - 2 weeks) through study week 52 throughout the dur ation of the 
study.   An additional BNP assessment will be completed at the six and 12 month 
post treatment visit and compared to previous concentrations.   
2.9.2  Biomarkers like natriuretic pepti des have been widely used for monitoring of 
heart failure of any etiology. Natriuretic peptides levels are more sensitive than 
symptoms and become elevated even in asymptomatic left ventricular 
dysfunction.  Specifically, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is  produced primarily in 
cardiac atria and ventricles. Its levels rise in response to stretch of ventricular 
myocytes or increases in wall tension and reflect the severity of heart failure . 52, 53 
2.9.3  In the setting of chemotherapy -induced cardiomyopathy, early detection of these 
markers may identify “high- risk” group which can benefit from close 
observation.54 During the evolution of doxorubicin- induced left ventricular 
dysfunction the secretion of natriuretic peptides is more closely associated with 
the impairment of left ventricular diastolic filling than with the deterioration of left ventricular systolic function.
55 
2.9.4  Brain natriuretic peptide and not NT -proBNP  was chosen to be measured for this 
study because the difference between the two is subtle, and the use of BNP is 
more common.56  The objective for measuring BNP is to allow for early detection 
of LVEF in subjects receiving trastuzumab therapy.   
Troponin I (TnI) 
 
2.9.5  Cardiac t roponin I is a well established early marker of myocardial injury, 
includi ng injury related to high- dose chemotherapy.57 Even minimal elevations of 
TnI  is predictive of late changes in ejection fraction;58 and, increases soon after 
high-dose chemotherapy is considered a strong predictor of poor cardiac 
outcome.13  Most recently the utility of Tn I as a predictor of unforeseeable and 
refractory cardiotoxicity in patients treated with trastuzumab for breast cancer 
has been reported.59   
2.9.6  In a single center study by Cardinale et al.59  evaluated TnI before and after  each 
course of trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy or treatment of metastatic breast 
cancer.  O nly 5% of patients without TnI  elevation in the course of treatment 
developed cardiomyopathy.  On the other hand, 62% of those with elevated TnI  
later demonstrated reduced left ventricular ejection fractions.  Moreover, there 
was less recovery of cardiac function in those patients who had elevated TnI , the 
strongest predictor of cardiotoxicity repor ted in this study.  
2.9.7  We believe this prospective randomized controlled clinical trial presents an ideal 
opportunity to compare the specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive 
value of both BNP and Tn I in patients with breast cancer who are rec eiving 
trastuzumab.  If Tn I is a more sensitive marker of trastuzumab- induced 
cardiomyopathy, the practice of screening with cumbersome and costly cardiac 
imaging every three months could change to selectively  imaging only those 
patients in whom  a screening  TnI was abnormal .   
2.9.8  Given the large difference  in cardiac toxicity between anthracycline-  and non-
anthracycline- containing regimens,60 the protocol seeks to approximate the 
sample size of each regim en to ensure that the power of the study wlll be 
sufficient .

 2.10 Non- fasting c omprehensive metabolic panel  (CMP)   
2.10.1  For safety monitoring purposes, a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) will be 
collected at each follow -up visit during active therapy monitor renal and liver 
function for potential adverse reactions  
2.11 Quality of Life:  
2.11.1  Cardiotoxicity is often associated with adverse symptoms, including fatigue, coughing spells, and shortness of breath.    Therefore, an assessment of health 
relate d quality of life (HRQL) will be measured as a secondary objective to 
determine whether the hypothesized reduction of cardiotoxicity in patients 
randomized to lisinopril or Coreg CR® correlates with HRQ L. An improvement in 
HRQL or at least stable HRQL shou ld accompany prevention of 
cardiotoxicity.   Measurement of HRQL can also be correlated to the possible 
onset of LVEF changes measured by ECHO or MUGA  and/or the change in 
troponin I and/or BNP.  
 
2.11.2  The European Organization for Research and T reatment of Cancer C ore Quality 
of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ -30) will be used to assess quality of life at 
baseline, at study week 52 (or at the end of trastuzumab therap y, if it is given for 
less than one year), and at study months 18 and 24 (or 6 and 12 months after the 
last dose of trastuzumab, if given for less than one year ). The EORTC QLQ -C30 
is a validated, multidimensional, self -administered questionnaire developed to 
assess the quality of life in cancer patients across a range of cultural setti ngs.
60-62  
It will be used to assess quality of life as a secondary endpoint.  The 
questionnaire consists of 30 questions that pertain to the patient and their health.  Questions are answered using a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 being “not at all” and 4 
being “very much”, except for questions 29 and 30, which are answered using a 
7 point scale ranging from 1 “very poor” to 7 “excellent”.  Approximately 10 to 15 
minutes are required to complete the questionnair e.  
2.12 Gender and Ethnicity:  
2.12.1  Entry into this study is open to males and females  of all ethnic backgrounds.  
SunCoast  CCOP Research Base members estimate that approximately 20% of 
accrual to CCOP Research Base studies in general will be patients with minority 
backgrounds.  A similar distribution is anticipated for this protocol.  
 
3.0 Objectives:  
3.1 The primary objective of this study is to determine if administration of lisinopril or Coreg 
CR® , compared to placebo, will reduce the incidence of trastuzumab- induced

therapy  for HER2 positive breast cancer.  
3.2 The secondary objectives  of this study are to determine:

6.7 To prevent biasing the outcome of the study, this is a double- blind study design, where 
both the clinical staff  and the participants are blinded to the specific nature of the product 
(study agent and placebo).  
6.8 After consenting t o participate in the study, the following steps will occur:  
6.8.1  Subjects will be registered and randomized by calling the automated Interactive 
Voice Response (IVR) telephone System  at 1-866-835-6793, which is  available 
24 hours/day and 7 days/week.  (Note:  CTSU sites should contact the CTSU 
registration to perform the enrollment, per Appendix VIII).  
6.8.2  For the first patient enrolled at each site:  
6.8.2.1  Research staff will complete the Medication Order Form for treating 
physician’s signature, and then fax the form to the investigational 
pharmacy at 1 -866-992-9966.   
6.8.2.2  If the form is received for processing by 12:00pm noon, study agent 
will be released to the site the same day for courier two -day  delivery.

 6.8.2.4  With the first patient registration , “site stock” study agent will be 
released to the site for future patients and for patient refills.  Patient -
Specific Medication Order Forms need to be faxed to the 
investigational pharmacy at 1- 866-992-9966 for the first patient only.  
6.8.3  Research staff will  complete the On- Study Form (See Appendix III) at baseline, 
collecting demographic information, personal and medical history .  
6.8.4  Laboratory assessments CMP (non-fasting c omprehensive metabolic panel ) 
(CMP T code 80053) ,Troponin I  (CMP T code 84484) and BNP [B-Type Natriuretic 
Peptide]  (CMP T code 83880)  will be submitted to LabCorp using pre- printed 
forms supplied by the SCUSF  CCOP Research Base Operations Center  at no 
charge. CMP ,  Troponin I and BNP will be collected at baseline, every 3 months 
X 4 (+/ - 2 weeks) , study week  52 (or end of trastuzumab therapy if discontinued 
before week 52 or if study agent is stopped before week #52), study month 18 (or 
6 months after the last dose of trastuzumab or stopped study agent ) and Study 
month 24 (or 12 months after the last dose of trastuzumab or stopped study 
agent ).  
6.8.4.1  BNP and Troponin I  should be drawn AFTER registration and 
BEFORE patient receives study agent and trastuzumab 
6.8.4.2  Laboratory specimens should be drawn BEFORE contrast material is 
administered for a MUGA Scan, as test results may be altered.  
6.8.4.3  Laboratory specimens will be submitted to the local LabCorps.  
Preliminary and final results will be sent directly to the site as 
indicated on the Intent to Participate Form  (or, for CTSU sites, the 
Site Contact Form) .  LabCorp will submit Final results directly to the 
SunCoast  CCOP Research Base Operations Center.  LabCorp will 
invoice the SunCoast  CCOP Research Base Operations Center for 
the tests.  
6.8.5  MUGA scan [ CMP T code 78472]  or ECHO [ CMP T code 93306 without contras t] 
LVEF  will be used to measure cardiac function at baseline, every 3 months X 4 (+/ - 
2 weeks) , Study week 52 (or end of trastuzumab therapy  if discontinued before 
week 52 or study agent is stopped before week #52), study month 18 (or 6 
months after the last dose of trastuzumab or stopped study agent)  and Study 
month 24 (or 12 months after the last dose of trastuzumab or stopped study 
agent ).  
6.8.5.1  Baseline LVEF with in 6 weeks of study entry  is acceptable.  The 
same measurement test (MUGA or ECHO) must  be used throughout 
the study.   
6.8.6  For sites  using ECHO ,de-identified copies of the ECHO report will be submitted 
with the Patient Assessment form for a central review by the study’s Principle 
Investigator  of the mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation and velocity, mitral 
inflow E’ & A’ velocities, tissue Doppler E’ and A’ velocities, mitral annulus E’ & A’ 
velocities, and septal side E’ & A’ velocities . 
6.8.7  Participants will complete the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer’s Quality of L ife Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ -C30), 
supplied by the Research Base (see Appendix III).  The EORTC QLQ -C30 will be 
completed at pre-treatment visit , study week 52 (or end of  trastuzumab therapy if 
discontinued before week 52 or study agent is stopped before week #52) and 
study months 18 and 24 (or 6 and 12 months after the last dose of  trastuzumab 
or stopped study agent .  EORTC QLQ -C30 should be completed AFTER 
registration and BEFORE patient receives study agent and trastuzumab

 6.8.8  Physical examination, including height and weight will be performed at baseline, 
every  3 months X 4 (+/ - 2 weeks), study week 52 (or end of  trastuzumab therapy if 
discontinued before week 52) and study months 18 and 24 (or 6 and 12 months 
after the last dose of trastuzumab.  Report s of disease status will be requested 
every 3 months until the study ends ( 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after discontinuation 
of study  agent).  
6.8.9  Research Staff will complete a baseline Concomitant Medication Form (see 
Appendix III)  at baseline and every 3 months X 4 (+/ - 2 weeks), study week 52 (or 
end of trastuzumab therapy if discontinued before week 52), and every 3 months 
following discontinuation of study agent at  each subsequent study visit .  Reports 
of disease status will be requested and concomitant medications will be 
submitted every 3 months until the study ends ( 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after 
discontinu ation of study agent).  Concomitant Medications should include 
chemotherapy agents and any medications listed in Appendix V.  
6.8.10  Research staff will instruct participants to begin taking their study medicine on 
the morning of the day they are scheduled to begin  trastuzumab treatment.  
Participants will be instructed to take study agent once daily with food at about 
the same time each day.    
6.8.11  For monitoring of compliance, patients will complete Study Medicine Daily Logs .  
Instructions for completing the forms will be given each time study agent is 
dispensed.  Research staff will collect and review Study Medicine Daily Logs at 
all follow -up visits and the off -treatment visit (see Appendix III) for compliance , 
documentatio n of blood pressure monitoring and adverse event reporting.     
6.8.12  Discrepancies noted on the Study Medicine Daily Logs will be addressed and documented.  If a discrepancy is evident, research staff will clarify with the 
patient, and instruct on how to prevent future discrepancies.   
6.8.13  Study Medicine Daily Logs are to be submitted to the Research Base Operations Center at least every 3 months.  If the logs are being collected more frequently, 
they may be submitted at any time.  
6.8.14  Adverse events will be documented, using the Adverse Event (AE) Form  
(Appendix III), graded using the  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE ) version 4.0, and reported per guidelines in section 8.11.  
6.8.15  Patients will be instructed to take their blood pressure every day during the first 
week of study medicine, three times a week the second week of the study, and 
then weekly while taking the study medicine.   Blood pressure results will be 
documented on the Study Medicine Daily Log.    
6.8.15.1  Blood pressure cuffs will be provided to the patient by the SunCoast  
CCOP Research Base at no charge.  
6.8.16  Follow -up visits will be scheduled 
every 3 months X 4 (+/ - 2 weeks) through Study 
week 52 ( or when trastuzumab therapy ends, if it is discontinued before week 
52).  Follow -up visits should occur within +/ - 10 working days of the expected visit 
schedule.  
6.8.17  Patients who fail treatment or discontinue study agent prematurely, will continue 
in study follow -up for 12 months, having LVEF measurements 6 and 12 months 
after study agent was discontinued .  An additional report of concomitant 
medications and disease status will be requested every 3 months X 4 after 
discontinuing study agent . 
6.8.17.1  Patients may be re- challe nged with trastuzumab per ASCO

7.0 Treatment Response Assessment:  
 
Study  failure is defined as:  
7.1 An absolute decrease in LVEF from baseline of  ≥ 10%  at follow -up (for example–  if MUGA 
is 80% at baseline, then 70% is a 10% decrease in LVEF and study failure; if ECHO is 60 – 
65%, then 50 – 55% is a 10% decrease in LVEF and study failure) . 
7.2 An absolute decrease of ≥ 5% in LVEF from baseline for individuals with < 50% LVEF  at 
follow -up  (for example–  if MUGA is 52% at baseline, then 47% is a 5% decrease in LVEF 
and study failure).  
 
Criteria for discontinuing study agent:  
7.3 Treatment failure  
7.4 Treatment with trastuzumab discontinued  
7.5 Symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension

8.3 Definitions : 
8.4 An adverse event  is defined as:  “…an unfavorable and unintended sign, sym ptom or 
disease associated with a participant’s participation in this research study .”   
8.5 Serious adverse events  include those events that:  “result in death; are life- threatening; 
require inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; create 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defects.”   
8.6 An unexpec ted adverse event is defined as “ any adverse experience…the specificity or 
severity of which is not consistent with the risks of information described in the literature 
(protocol and package insert s).”  
8.7 Expected adverse events  are those that are “ identifie d in the research protocol as having 
been previously associated with or having the potential to arise as a consequence of 
participation in the study .”

symptom or disease associated with a participant’s participation in this research 
study .”  As such:  
8.11.1.1  Adverse events, such as hospitalization with febrile neutropenia, are 
not reportable events on this study.  In this example, the event is 
associated with administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy, which 
would be administered regardless of participation in this study.   
8.11.1.2  In this same ex ample, if the severity of neutropenia is higher than 
expected,  and if a clinician determines that it is possibly, probably or 
definitely related to administration of a study agent, the event would 
be reportable.  
8.11.2  Review the patient’s Study Medicine Log reg ularly for patient reported AEs  that 
may be related to administration of study agent .  In particular, document the 
incidence of:

10.0 Statistical considerations  
 
Primary Outcome Variables : 
10.1 The primary aim of this study is to determine if treatment with lisinopril or Coreg CR® can 
reduce the incidence of trastuzumab- induced cardiotoxicity in patients with HER2 -positive 
breast  cancer after 52 weeks of treatment as measured by the preservation of left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).  Patients who demonstrate an LVEF < 50% at follow -
up and a ≥ 5% absolute decrease in EF from baseline, or a  ≥ 10% absolute decrease in 
LVEF  after initiating trastuzumab therapy will be considered failures.  
 
10.2 We will compare the LVEF of each treatment group with the placebo arm. In addition, a comparison of the two study agents will be completed, recognizing that we do not have 
sufficient power for this secondary analysis.  Linear regression with treatment and 
anthracycline regimen (yes/no) as independent factors will be used to compare the 
changes of LVEF , a continuous measure between the two arms (treatment arms with 
placebo).  Logistic regression with treatment and anthracycline regimen (yes/no) will be 10/08/2010

 used to compare the proportions of cardiac failures in each arm. For comparisons of each 
treatment with placebo, we will consider one- sided 0.025 significant levels to adjust for the 
multiple testing.  A mixed linear model will be utilized to analyze the patter n of LVEF 
change during the course of this study using the data from all follow -up visits. 
Furthermore, a multiple regression model will be used to control for potential confounders 
such as use of other agents (i.e.  pertuzumab).  
Sample Size:   
10.3 The sample s ize calculation is based on the comparisons of each treatment with placebo.  
Using a conservative incidence estimate, we hypothesize that 15% of women treated for 
breast cancer with adjuvant or neoadjuvant trastuzumab will have decreased  LVEF in the 
placebo arm as compared to 5% of the women on the treatment arms.  To detect a 10% 
difference in women who exhibit a decrease in LVEF in response to study agent, lisinopril 
or Coreg CR®, a sample size of 141 participants for each of the three arms is required to 
achieve 80% power for a one- sided Pearson’s chi -square test at the 0.025 significance 
level.  Assuming a 10% drop- out rate, 468 subjects will be randomized to one of the three 
arms.   
 
10.4 Given the large difference in cardiac toxicity between the regimens,60 the protocol seeks to 
approximately balance the regimens by enrollment to 2 separate cohorts; patients who 
received an anthracycline- containing regimen and patient s whose treatment regimen did 
not contain an anthracycline. A minimum  of 187 subjects will be enrolled to each cohort.  
As such, should accrual to a cohort reach 281, that cohort will be closed to new  accrual 
and the study will be completed with accrual to the remaining cohort.   
 
Intent -to-Treat Principle:  
 
10.5 As possible, all statistical analyses will be based on the intent -to-treat principle. Subjects 
will be analyzed according to their randomized ass ignment . 
 
Secon dary Outcome Variables  
10.6 Interruptions of trastuzumab therapy  caused by a decrease of LVEF will be evaluated by 
comparing the number of trastuzumab cycles completed without interruption by patients within each treatment group.  Poisson regression will be utilized to compare the number of 
trastuzum ab cycles completed.  Furthermore, the proportion of patients completing 
uninterrupted trastuzumab therapy will be compared.  Logistic regression  will be utilized to 
compare the proportion of patient s completing trastuzumab therapy between treatment 
arms.  The frequency of all trastuzumab interruptions categorized by the criteria for study 
agent discontinuation (Section 7.0) and 95% confidence interval will  be reported and 
compared by treatment group.  A Fisher’s exact test or chi -square test, depending on cell 
size, will be utilized to compare the frequency  of categorized trastuzumab interruptions  
between the treatment arms.   
 
10.7 Quality of life changes will be evaluated using the EORTC QLQ -C30 V 3.0 at baseline and 
at the end of  treatment  (end of trastuzumab therapy or week 52).  The analysis plan will 
follow a linear regression model to consider the treatment effects on these measurements 
(dependent variables) adjusted for baseline age and potentially other covariates to 
compare the treatment arms.  The obser ved data will be evaluated for normality and 
appropriate transformation introduced prior to conducting the analysis.   
 
10.8 To assess the long term effect of the study agents, follow -up measurements will be 
collected at study months 18 and 24 (or 6 and 12 months after the last dose of 
trastuzumab, if it was discontinued before week 52) . This exploratory analysis will be 
complet ed to determine the long term effects on the prevention of cardiomyopathy and

 impact on QOL for either or both study agents. The treatment groups will be compared to 
using appropriate two sample tests.  
 
10.9 Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be used to determine the predictive value of two most common biomarkers in predicting trastuzumab- induced cardiotoxicity: 
Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) vs. Cardiac troponin I . The null hypothesis is that areas 
under ROC (AUCROC) for the two b iomarkers regarding identification of trastuzumab-
induced cardiotoxicity (primary endpoint) are equal. Areas under the ROC curves will be tested using Delong’s nonparametric approach, applying generalized U -statistics to 
generate an estimated covariance matrix for correlated ROC curves 
63. Due to the 
uncertainty about the treatment effect of the active drugs, this analysis will be limited to the 
placebo group only. With approximate 15% incidence rate in the placebo group, the 
proposed sample size will achie ve a power greater than 80% to reject the null if the true 
difference between two ROCAUCs is 20% or more, assuming the correlation between 
BNP and Troponin I is 0.60.   
 
Adverse Events  
10.10  Adverse Events and side effects will be tabulated and compared for all patients.  Adverse Events experienced will be compared with respect to frequency using the Fisher’s exact 
test or chi square test if the cell size is sufficient between arms.  Estimates of the AE rates as well as exact 95% confidence intervals for AEs will also be reported by treatment arm.  
All available AE data will be summarized and reviewed by the SCUSF  CCOP Research 
Base Data Monitoring Committee at least every six months.   
 
11.0 Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
11.1 This protocol will be monitored in accordance with the SunCoast  CCOP Research Base 
Data Safety Monitoring plan on file with the NCI last updated June 09 , 2009.

12.0 Study Feasib ility: Role of participating CCOPs  
12.1 Member CCOPs and SunCoast affiliates will be responsible for enrolling 468 subjects 
during this study, which is expected to accrue for 3  years.  
 
12.2 This study will be conducted in the community setting where this patient population is 
seen.  
 
12.3 Study forms are available via the SunCoast CCOP Research Base website (http://www. SunCoast ccop.org
) 
 
12.4 An automated registration/randomization system is available 24/7.  
 
12.5 Study agent will be provided at no cost to the patient or clinical center by the SunCoast 
CCOP Research Base.  
 
12.6 Laboratory testing will be provided at no cost to the patient or clinical center by the SunCoast CCOP Research Base.  Specimens will be submitted to the local LabCor p for 
processing.  Preliminary and final reports will be submitted directly to the site by LabCorp 
and final results will be submitted directly to the SunCoast CCOP Research Base 
Operations Center by LabCorp.  
 
12.7 Blood pressure cuffs will be provided at no cost to the patient or clinical center.

 12.9 Funds are available to reimburse clinical centers in the event payment  of follow -up LVEF 
testing is not covered as standard of care.  Using Medicare reimbursable rates, a clinical 
center may invoice the Research Base, using the Reimbursement Request From in 
Appendix III, for $300 if other payment is denied.   
12.10  Evidence of training in Responsible Conduct of Research shall be on file at the SunCoast 
Research Base Operations Center prior to study start -up. 
12.11  Informed consent will be obtained and documented prior to initiation of any study related 
procedures.  
12.12  Basic guidelines for confidentiality and medical ethics will be closely adhered to during the 
study.  
12.13  Data submission guidelines addressed in Section  9.0 will be followed.  Queries will be 
generated by the SunCoast Research Base Operations Center for missing or unclear data 
elements.  
12.14  CCOPs and enrolling SunCoast affiliates will be audited within 18 months of the first 
accrual and at least once every three years thereafter.  
12.15  Subjects may be enrolled on other research studies if the studies do not impact eligibility 
criteria or protocol treatment for this study  and is permitted by the local site Institutional 
Review Board.   
12.16  This trial is feasible to  conduct in the community setting.  To determine the feasibility of 
completing this trial under the CCOP mechanism, we surveyed our adult  CCOP members 
for interest and estimated annual accrual.  We received an enthusiastic response to this 
study.  Of the 17 members surveyed, 11 members plan to participate in this study.  Based 
on the feedback we received from our adult CCOP members, and all owing for a 
reasonable start up period, we estimate that the protocol will accrue at a rate of 12  
patients per month.  We anticipate that recruiting for this study will take approximately 39 months to reach the accrual goal of 468.   
12.17  We are aware of 6 treat ment trials in patients with HER -2 positive breast cancer that 
employ trastuzumab in the treatment regimen.  While the cardiotoxic effects of study 
therapy will be evaluated, only 2 studies will include this in their primary objectives.  Furthermore, these trials do not include the use of supportive care agents such as those 
listed in this study.  SCUSF 0806 differs from the BETH trial (NSABP B- 44-1) in that 
SCUSF 0806 allows neoadjuvant chemotherapy (including anthracycline- containing 
regimens) the pathology requirements are not as stringent, no tissue samples are required 
and the LVEF entry criterion is lower for SCUSF 0806 (≥ 50% vs. ≥ 55%).  As such, we do 
not anticipate any effect on our accrual potential .

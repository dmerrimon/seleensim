BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION FOR CONDUCTING THE 
TRIAL
Successful human reproduction is dependent upon the influence of progesterone on endometr ial 
structure and receptivity . Once the corpus luteum is formed after ovulation, it begins to secrete 
progesterone, which is necessary  and sufficient to decidualize the endometrium to facilitate 
implantation. If conception and implantation occur, increasing concentrations of human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG) drive continued secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum, which is 
critical for the maintenance of the endometrium. Progesterone continues to be produced b y the 
corpus luteum until the seventh or eighth week of gestation, at which time the placenta becomes 
the primary  site of production for the remainder of pregnancy .
Administration of exogenous progesterone to support luteal function has been utilized in the 
treatment of infertility , particularl y with ART. A number of studies have demonstrated that the 
use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogs during controlled ovarian stimulation is 
associated with defects in corpus luteal function. Progesterone supplementation after the transfer 
of a fresh, autologous embry o has been shown to improve pregnancy  rates.
Vaginal routes of progesterone administration have been shown to allow effective targeted 
delivery  for various indications, including supplementation of corpus luteal function. The vaginal 
route offers several important advantages over other methods: it is convenient and acceptable for

Vaginal Ring
Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALmany  subject s, is not painful, does not require any  special equipment, s ystemic levels are low, 
and it rarel y produces allergic or other adverse reactions.
A flexible, non -degradable progesterone vaginal ring (PVR) has been developed, releasing an 
average of 11 mg  progesterone/day  consistently  over 7 day s.The progesterone (20% w/w) is in a 
micronized formulation and dispersed evenly  throughout the ring. 
In a pivotal p hase 3 trial (Teva Women’s Health, Inc. Study  DR-PGN -302) evaluating the 
efficacy  and safet y of PVR used for luteal phase support in women undergoing in vitro 
fertilization (I VF), the primary  endpoint was clinical pregnancy  rate at 8 and 12 weeks of 
pregna ncy.Once -
weekl y PVR was statistically  non-inferior to the active comparator, dail y 8% 
progesterone vaginal gel, in women 18- 34 years of age. Secondary  efficacy anal yses included 
evaluations of live birth rate, cy cle cancellation rate, rate of spontaneous abortion, rate of 
biochemical pregnancy , and rate of ectopic pregnancy  for each treatment group. These rates were 
similar between the 2 active treatment groups and consistent with reported background rates.
Weekly  PVR insertion appeared to be safe and well tolerated. Adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (S AEs) were similar for both active treatment groups, and no significant safet y 
trends were noted for PVR. Treatment -related AEs were generally  similar between the 2 active 
treatment groups and co nsistent with the known safety  profile of progesterone. Rates of subject
discontinuation due to an AE were similar between the treatment groups. AEs related to vaginal 
bleeding were similar between the 2 active treatment groups. No subject discontinued bec ause of 
vaginal bleeding, and no subject was switched to an alternative progesterone product because of a 
bleeding issue. There were no increased rates of cervical/vaginal abrasions or irritation associated 
with use of a vaginal ring compared with vaginal gel.
Manufacturing enhancements for the PVR were impleme nted subsequent to the pivotal phase 3 
trial. Therefore, a bioequivalence trialwas conducted to compare the PVR manufactured using 
the new process to the ring manufactu red by  the legacy  process (the phase 3 clinical trial 
material). The results from the pharmacokinetic trial(DR201- BE-10021) demonstrated that the 
PVR manufactured with the new process was bioequivalent to the PVR produced from the legacy  
process. The safet y data indicated that both rin gs were similarl y safe and well tolerated b y 
healthy , postmenopausal female subjects who were pretreated with estrogen.
The present trial assesses the safet y and tolerability of the PVR manufactured with the new 
process when used for luteal phase support i n women undergoing ART. While the design of the 
proposed trialis similar to that of the pivotal p hase 3 trial for the PVR, changes to the way  in 
which AEs are collected and scored have been implemented as requested by  the Agency .

METHODOLOGY
This is an open -label, single -arm, safety trialof PVR for luteal phase support in women 
undergoing IVF with fresh oocy tes.Women between the ages of 18 and 34 years with tubal, 
idiopathic, male factor, ovulatory  dysfunction, or endometriosis -linked infertility , who agree to 
be considered for inclusion in the trial, will be invited to be seen at the trialsite.
Once informed consent is obtained, eligible subjects will be started on an ovarian down -
regulation / suppression protocol utilizing combined oral contraceptives supplied by the site for 
≥14 day s to ≤21 days (based upon the site standard of care), with leuprolide a cetate at a dose of 
0.1mL (500 µg)/day  beginning 4days prior to the last birth control pill and for ≥10 day s to 
≤20days; ovarian suppression is to begin in the cycle immediately  prior to the ovarian 
stimulation cy cle.After suppression, an ovarian stimulation protocol will begin on the second or 
third day after the start of menses 
with a reduction in leuproli de acetate dose to 0.05 mL  
(250 µg/day ) followed by  an individuall y determined ovarian stimulation protocol with highl y 
purified, human menopausal gonadotropin (HP -hMG; MENOPUR) at an initial dose o f 
225IU/day  for 5 day s according to label. Based on clinical monitoring, subsequent dosing should 
be adjusted according to individual subject response. Dose adjustments should not be made more 
frequentl y than once every two days and should not exceed 150 IU per adjustment. The 
maximum daily  dose of MENOPUR should not exceed 450 IUand the minimum daily  dose 
should not be lower than 75 IU .MENOPUR dosing should not continue for >20 day sand 
coasting is not allowed .

determined .A subject must have at least 2 follicles ≥17mm (mean of 2dimensions) to receive 
the hCG trigger. Subjects who do not reach this threshold after 20 day s of stimulation are to be 
discontinued from the trial. If the estradiol level is ≥5000 pg/mL, hCG should not be 
administered and the subject should be discontinued from the trial.
Oocy te retrieval will occur approximately  35-37 hours after hCG administration. On the day  after 
oocy te retrieval, the subject will begin treatment with the I nvestigation al Medicinal Product 
(IMP), PVR. Following instruction o n PVR insertion and removal, the subject will insert the first 
PVR (PVR1) at the trial site
.The PVR will remain in place a minimum of 23 hours/day .The 
subject will remove PVR1 before fresh embry o transfer and reinsert it after the transfer .Fresh 
embry o transfer will occur 5 day s after oocy te retrieval per the trialsite’s protocol. The number 
of embry os to transfer must be guided b y the 2017 American Societ y for Reproductive Medicine 
(ASRM) and the Societ y for Assisted Reproductive Technology  (SART) guidelines 
(SART/ASRM 2017): women with the expectation of one or more high -quality  embry o(s)
available for cry opreservation, and women with previous live birth after an IVF cy cle, will have
transfer of a single blastocy st. All other women will have transfer of no more than two 
blastocy sts.Additional PVRs will be distributed for weekl y insertion, with the second PVR 
(PVR2) to be inserted at home 7 day s following the initial insertion of the first PVR (PVR1) , and 
the third PVR (PVR3) to be inserted either at home or at the site 7 day s follo wing the insertion of 
PVR2 .
Two weeks after oocy te retrieval, a blood draw will be performed to measure serum levels of 
progesterone and β -hCG. Subjects with a β- hCG level <5 mIU/mL will be discontinued from the 
trial.Those with a β -hCG level ≥5mIU/mL will insert their next PVR and continue in the trial
for up to a total of 10 weeks 
(up to a total of 10 PVRs). Additional serum pregnancy  tests will be 
performed at 2 weeks + 3 -4 day s and at 3 weeks. Subjects who are no longer pregnant will be 
discontinued from the trial. Subjects with positive β -hCG results at 3 weeks will insert PVR4 and 
receive PVR5 and PVR6 to be inserted weekl y.
A TVUS will be performed to document the pre sence of an intrauterine gestational sac 4 weeks + 
3-4 day s after oocy te retrieval. If it is determined that the subject has an ectopic pregnancy , the 
subject will be treated according to the site’s standard protocol and will be withdrawn from the 
trial. Six weeks after oocy te ret rieval, a TVUS will be performed to determine the presence and 
number of gestational sacs with/without fetal heart beat.Pregnant subjects will insert PVR7 and 
receive additional PVRs to be inserted weekl y (PVR8, PVR9, and PVR10). Ten w eeks after 
oocy te retrieval (if the subject is pregnant), an ultrasound (either transvaginal or abdominal) will 
be performed to determine the number of gestational sacs present with and without fetal heart 
beat and the estimated gestational age.
Safety  will be monitored throu

DURATION OF TREATMENT
Eligible subjects will receive up to 10 weeks of progesterone treatment if the subject becomes 
and remains pregnant. Treatment will be stopped if it is determined the subject has a failed 
attempt at becoming pregnant or is found to no longer be pregnant.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Primary Analysis
At the final anal ysis, the cumulative rate of any  spontaneous abortion, including spontaneous 
clinically  recognized pregnancy  loss and blighted ovum during the trial(up to Week 12 following 
oocy te retrieval), in subjects treated with PVR following fresh e mbryo transfer will be estimated
(i.e.,modified intention -to-treat [mI TT] population). 
The number and rate of any  spontaneous abortions (occurring on or before 12 weeks following 
oocy te retrieval) for subjects in the mITT cohort will be summarized and th e associated two -
sided exact 95% confidence interval will be generated. Upon generating the two -sided exact 
95% confidence interval, the upper bound of the interval will be assessed for whether it excludes 
or fails to exclude a spontaneous abortion rate of 15%.
Determination of Sample Size
Statistical simulations have been performed to understand the operating characteristics under 
varying assumptions for both the sample size of the mITTanalysis population and the “true” 
proportion of spontaneous abortions. For each simulation rep etition , a sample of subjects was 
simulated using the binomial distribution and a given pair of sample size and “true” proportion of 
spontaneous abortions assum ptions. A two -sided 95% exact confidence interval wasthen created 
based on the simulated data and the upper bound of this confidence interval wascompared to the 
threshold of 0.15 ( corresponding to a spontaneous abortion rate of 15%). If the upper bound o f 
the two- sided 95% exact confidence interval wasless than 0.15, the simulation rep etition was

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALdeclared a “success”. If, however, the upper bound of the two-sided 95% exact confidence 
interval wasgreater than or equal to 0.15, the simulation rep etition was declared a “failure”. This 
process wasrepeated 10,000 times for each combination of assumed sample size and “true” 
proportion of spontaneous abortions. The proportion of simulation rep etition successes to the 
total number of simulation rep etitions then describe d the power of the proposed trialgiven the 
pair of assumptions.
If the “true” spontaneous abortion rate is 8%, 9%, or 10%, the sample size required to achieve 
80% power to exclude the possibility  of a 15% spontaneous abortion rate after the use o f PVR is 
180, 240, or 365, respectively .Taking the middle of this range, a trialwith 240 subjects in the 
mITT anal ysis population is considered as being adequatel y powered under a relevant 
assumption in the target population.
Assessment of Primary and Secondary Endpoints
There are 3 anal ysis cohorts for this trial . The mITT cohort consists of all subjects who had 
successful oocy teretrieval, received at least 1 dose of IMP, and had completed fresh embry o 
transfer. The safet y cohort comprises all subjects treated with IMP. The eligible subjects (ES) 
cohort consists of all subjects who were deemed eligible for trialparticipation based on inclusion 
and exclusion criteria at screening and treated with oral contraceptives, leuprolide acetate ,or 
MENOPUR.
Theprimary  objective is to estimate the cumulative rate of an y spontaneous abortion, including 
spontaneous clinicall y recognized pregnancy loss and blighted ovum during the trial(up to 
Week 12 following oocy te retrieval) for subjects in the mI TT cohort. Thenumber and rates of 
any spontaneous abortions will be summarized and associated exact 95% confidence intervals 
will be generated. Furthermore, 
as part of a Bayesian sensitivity  analysis, a95% credible interval
will be generated . The spontaneous abortion rate, biochemical abortion rate, clinical pregnancy  
rate, and positive β -hCG rate will be similarly  analy zed for the mITT and safety  cohort, for 
subject s that had oocy te(s
)retrieved. However, for these endpoints, credible intervals will not be 
derived. Furthermore, safety  will be assessed by  summarizing treatment-emergent AEs for the 
safet y and ES cohort s. Treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized overall, by  grade ( intensit y), 
seriousness, and drug relatedness b y system organ class and preferred term us ing the Medical 
Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities. A treatment -emergent AE is an y AE that occurs after the 
start of PVR andthrough the end of the trial, or a pretreatment AE/medical condition that 
worsens in intensity  after the start of PVR .Furthermor e, a separate treatment -emergent AE 
summary  table will be generated for AEs of special interest, such as vaginal pain and irritation ,
vaginal infection, vaginal bleeding/spotting, vaginal hemorrhage, vaginal adhesions and vaginal 
or cervical abrasions and lesions .These events will also be further anal yzed by  grade ( intensit y).
Tolerability  for the safety cohort will be assessed by  summarizing the total number of subjects 
who prematurely  discontinued PVR and the associated reasons for discontinuation. This 
summary  will be based on the safet y cohort.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Successful human reproduction is dependent upon the influence of progesterone on endometrial 
structure and receptivity .Once the corpus luteum is formed after ovulation, it begins to secrete 
progesterone, which is necessary  and sufficient to decidualize the endometrium to facilitate 
implantation. If conception and implantation occur, increasing concentrations of human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG) drive continued secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum, which is 
critical for the maintenance of earl y pregnancy and the endometrium (Penzias, 2002). Progesterone 
continues to be produced by  the corpus luteum until the seventh or eighth week of gestation, at 
which time the placenta becomes the primary  site of production for the remainder of pregnancy .
Unfortunatel y, not all women of reproductive a ge are able to become pregnant or maintain a 
pregnancy ; indeed, 12 percent of women of reproductive age in the United States have received an 
infertility  service at some time in their lives. The administration of exogenous progesterone to 
support luteal fu nction has been utilized in the treatment of infertility , particularl y with assisted 
reproductive technology  (ART). Assisted reproductive technology  generally  involves the surgical 
removal of eggs from a woman’s ovaries, fertilizing them with sperm in the laboratory , and then 
returning them to either the donor woman’s or another woman’s uterus 
(Centers forDisease Control, 2005
).For man y women, in conjunction with ART, steps must be 
taken to prime the uterus for implantation and to sustain the pregnancy  after implantation. Many  
tools have been developed to aid in this process.
In the middle of the 1980s, gonadotrophin -releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists were incorporated 
into ovarian stimulation regimens and are associated with improved outcomes after in vitr o 
fertilization (I VF) and other ARTs. These GnRH agonists work b y suppressing the pituitary  and 
preventing premature surges of endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) during IVF cy cles and 
allowing time for a larger number of oocy tes to reach maturity  prior to harvesting. However, GnRH 
agonists inhibit the corpora lutea in these cy cles and may  create an iatrogenic luteal phase defect.
Use of a GnRH agonist causes suppression of pituitary  LH secretion for as long as 10 day s after the 
last dose, and pituitary  function may  not return completely  until 2 -3 weeks after the end of therapy .
Without this LH signal, the corpus luteum may  be dy sfunctional, and subsequent progesterone and 
estrogen secretion may  be abnormal, compromising endometrial receptivity  and potential ly leading 
to decreased implantation and pregnancy  rates ( Pritts, 2002 ).
Various hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and hCG have been used during the luteal 
phase and bey ond in IVF cy cles for luteal phase support. A 1994 meta -analy sis showed that the use 
of hCG or progesterone led to significantly  higher pregnancy  rates than placebo ( Soliman, 1994 ).
Most treatment protocols advocate the use of progesterone throughout the first trimester of 
pregnancy , since corpus luteum activity  has been demonstrated up to Week 10 of pregnancy , 
although progesterone supplementation continuing bey ond a positive serum pregnancy  test may  not 
be needed. The goal of progesterone supplementation is to assist a corpus luteum that may  have 
become compromised durin g ovulation induction or oocy te retrieval ( Penzias, 2002 ).

Vaginal Ring
Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALMoreover, the vaginal route of progesterone administration has been shown to allow effective 
targeted delivery  for various indications, including supplementation of corpus luteal function. The 
vaginal route offers several important advantages over other methods: it is convenient and 
acceptable for man y patients, is not painful, does not require an y special equipment, sy stemic levels 
are low, and it rarel y produces allergic or other adverse reactions .Therefore, a flexible, 
non-degradable progesterone vaginal ring (PVR) has been developed, releasing an average of 
11mg progesterone/day  consistently  over 7 day s.The progesterone (20% w/w) is in a micronized 
formulation and dispersed evenl y throughout t he ring.
1.2 Scientific Justification for Conducting the Trial
In a pivotal p hase 3 trial (Teva Women’s Health, Inc. Study  DR-PGN -302) evaluating the efficacy  
and safet y of a progesterone vaginal ring ( PVR )used for luteal phase support in women undergoing 
IVF, the primary  endpoint was clinical pregnancy
 rate at 8 and 12 weeks of pregnancy .Once 
weekl y PVR was statistically non -inferior to the active comparator, daily  8% progesterone vaginal 
gel, in women 18 -34 years of age. Secondary  efficacy  anal yses included evaluations of live birth 
rate, cy cle cancellation rate, rate of spontaneous abortion, rate of biochemical pregnancy , and rate 
of ectopic pregnancy  for each treatment group. These rates were similar between the 2 active 
treatment groups and consistent wit h reported background rates. Weekl y PVR insertion appeared to 
be safe and well tolerated. Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse event s (SAEs) were similar 
for both active treatment groups, and no significant safet y trends were noted for PVR. Treatment -
related AEs were generally  similar between the 2 active treatment groups and consistent with the 
known safet y profile of progesterone. Rates of subject discontinuation due to an AE were similar 
between the treatment groups. AE s related to vaginal bleeding w ere similar between the 2 active 
treatment groups. No subject discontinued because of vaginal bleeding, and no subject was 
switched to an alternative progesterone product because of a bleeding issue. There were no 
increased rates of cervical/vaginal abrasi ons or irritation associated with use of a vaginal ring 
compared with vaginal gel.
Manufacturing enhancements for the PVR were impleme nted subsequent to the pivotal phase 3 
trial. Therefore, a bioequivalence trialwas conducted to compare the PVR manufactured using the 
new process to the ring manufactu red by  the legacy  process (the phase 3 clinical trial material). The 
results from the pharmacokinetic trial(DR201- BE-10021) demonstrated that the PVR 
manufactured wi th the new process was bioequivalent to the PVR produced from the legacy  
process. The safet y data indicated that both rings were similarl y safe and well tolerated b y healthy, 
postmenopausal female subjects who were pretreated with estrogen.
The present tri alassesses the safet y and tolerability of the PVR manufactured with the new process 
when used for luteal phase support in women undergoing ART. While the design of the proposed 
trialis similar to that of the pivotal p hase 3 trial for the PVR, changes to the way  in which AEs are 
collected and scored have been implemented as requested b y the Agency.

The benefit/risk aspects are expected to be similar to what is outlined in the Investigator ’s Brochure 
for the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), PVR ,and in the appropriate package inserts for 
the non- investigational medicinal products: oral contraceptives, leuprolide acetate , hCG, and 
MENOPUR ( menotropins for injection [package insert], 2016 ).The PVR offers patients a 
convenient, once -weekl y option for luteal phase support as an alternative to twice -daily dosing or 3 -
times daily  dosing of the progesterone vaginal insert, once -daily  dosing of the progesterone vaginal 
gel, or once -daily intramuscular injection of progesterone in oil that are in current clinical use in the 
United States.

In this safet y trialthe assessment of the trial will be on the totality  of safet y information collected. 
Henc e, the purpose of categorizing the endpoints as primary  and secondary  is for prioritising the 
endpoints of interest rather than t ying the trial’s success to the outcome of the primary  objective.
2.1 Objectives
Primary Objective
To estimate the cumulative rate of an y spontaneous abortion, in cluding spontaneous 
clinically  recognized pregnancy  loss and blighted ovum during the trial(up to Week 12 
following oocy te retrieval), in subjects treated with PVR f ollowing fresh embry o transfer.
Secondary Objectives
To describe the cumulative rate of s pontaneous a bortions determined at 6 and 10 weeks 
post-oocy te retrieval, including spontaneous clinically  recognized pregnancy  loss and

3.1.2 Overall Design and Control Methods
This is an open -label, single -arm, safety trialof PVR for luteal phase support in women undergoing 
IVF with fresh oocy tes.Women between the ages of 18 and 34 years with tubal, idiopathic, male 
factor, ovulatory  dysfunction, or endometriosis -linked infertility , who agree to be considered for 
inclusion in the trial , will be invited to be seen at the trialsite.
Once informed consent is obtained, eligible subjects will 
be started on an ovarian down -regulation /
suppression protocol utilizing combined oral contraceptives supplied by  the site for ≥14 day s to 
≤21days (based upon the site standard of care), with leuprolide acetate at a dose of 0.1 mL 
(500 µg)/day  beginning 4 days prior to the last birth control pill and for ≥10 day s to ≤20 days; 
ovarian suppression is to begin in the cy cle immediately  prior to the ovarian stimulation cy cle.
After suppression, an ovarian stimulation protocol will begin on the second or third day after the 
start of menses 
with a reduction in leuprolide acetate dose to 0.05 mL (250 µg/day ) followed by  an 
individually  determined ovarian stimulation protocol with highl y purified, human menopausal 
gonadotropin (HP -hMG; MENOPUR) at an initial dose of 225 IU/day  for 5 day s according to label.
Based on clinical monitoring, subsequent dosing should be adjusted according to individual subject
response. Dose adjustments should not be made more frequently  than once every  two day s and 
should not exceed 150 IU per adjustment. The maximum daily  dose of MENOPUR should not 
exceed 450 IUand the minimum daily  dose should not be lower than 75 IU .MENOPUR dosing 
should not continue for >20 daysand coasting is not allowed. Subjects will be monitored to 
determine when to trigger ovulation with hCG. A TVUS will be performed to assess follicle size 
and serum estradiol levels will be determined. A subject must have at least 2 follicles ≥17 mm 
(mean of 2 dimensions) to receive the hCG trigger. Subjects who do not reach this threshold after 
20 day s of stimulation are to be discontinued from the trial.If the estradiol level is ≥5000 pg/mL, 
hCG should not be administered and the subject should be discontinued from the trial.

Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALOocy te retrieval will occur approximately  35-37 hours after hCG administration. On the day  after 
oocy te retrieval, the subject will begin treatment with the I MP, PV R. Following instruction on PVR
insertion and removal (see Appendix 1 ), the subject will insert the first PVR (PVR1) 
at the trial site
The PVR will remain in place a minimum of 23 hours/day . The s ubject will remove PVR1 before 
embry o transfer and reinsert it af ter the transfer. Fresh embry o transfer will occur 5 day s after 
oocy te retrieval per the trialsite’s protocol. The number of embryos to transfer must be guided b y 
the 2017 American Society  for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the Society  for Assisted 
Repr oductive Technology (SART) guidelines (SART/ASRM 2017): women with the expectation of 
oneor more high- quality  embry o(s)available for cry opreservation, and women with previous live 
birth after an IVF cycle, will have transfer of a single blastocy st. All other women will have transfer 
of no more than two blastocy sts.Additional PVRs will be distributed for weekl y insertion, with the 
second PVR (PVR2) to be inserted at home 7 day s following the initial insertion of the first PVR
(PVR1) , and the third PVR (P VR3) to be inserted either at home or at the site 7 day s following the 
insertion of PVR2 .
Two weeks after oocy te retrieval, a blood draw will be performed to measure serum levels of 
progesterone and β -hCG. Subjects with a β- hCG level <5 mIU/mL will be disc ontinued from the 
trial.Those with a β -hCG level ≥5mIU/mL will insert their next PVR and continue in the trial for 
up to a total of 10 weeks (up to a total of 10 PVRs). Additional serum pregnancy  tests will be 
performed at 2 weeks + 3
-4 day s and at 3 wee ks.Subjects who are no longer pregnant will be 
discontinued from the trial. Subjects with positive β -hCG results at 3 weeks will insert PVR4 and 
receive PVR5 and PVR6 to be inserted weekl y.
A TVUS will be performed to document the presence of an intrauter ine gestational sac 4 weeks 
+ 3-4 day safter oocy te retrieval. If it is determined that the subject has an ectopic pregnancy , the 
subject will be treated according to the site’s standard protocol and will be withdrawn from the 
trial. Six weeks after oocy teretrieval, a TVUS will be performed to determine the presence and 
number of gestational sacs with/without fetal heart beat.Pregnant subjects will insert PVR7 and 
receive additional PVRs to be inserted weekl y (PVR8, PVR9, and PVR10). Ten weeks after oocy te 
retrieval (if the subject is pregnant), an ultrasound (either transvaginal or abdominal) will be 
performed to determine the number of gestational sacs present with and without fetal heart beat and 
the estimated gestational age.
Safety
 will be monitored t hroughout the trial .Standardized criteria will be applied to AEs of special 
interest (vaginal bleeding, vaginal pain, and vaginal irritation etc., see section 8.3) to establish grade

Discussion of Overall Trial Design and Choice of Control Groups
3.5.1 Trial Design
This is an open -label, single -arm trialof progesterone supplementation (luteal phase support) in 
women undergoing IVF with fresh oocy tes.Each trialcenter will follow the trialcenter’s standard 
practice for ART unless otherwise noted in this protocol. On the day  after oocy te retrieval, the 
subject will begin treatment with the I MP, PVR. Embry o transfer will occur 5days after oocy te 
retrieval. A serum pregnancy  test will be conducted 2 weeks after the oocy te retrieval. Subjects 
with a β -hCG level <5 mIU/mL will b e discontinued from the trial.Those with a β- hCG level 
≥5mIU/mL will continue dosing with PVR for up to a total of 10 weeks.
The primary  objective is to estimate the cumulative rate of an y spontaneous abortion, including 
spontaneous clinicall y recognized pregnancy loss and blighted o vum during the trial (up to 
Week 12 following oocy te retrieval), in subjects treated with PVR following fresh embry o transfer. 
Approximately  240 subjects will be enrolled in the trialin order to ensure that 215subjects undergo 
fresh embryo transfer.
3.5.2 Selection of Endpoints
The endpoints in this trial(rate of an y spontaneous abortion, biochemical abortion, ectopic and 
heterotopic pregnancies as well as rate of clinical pregnancy  
and positive β- hCG ) are t ypical 
endpoints to demonstrate the safet y of product s used for progesterone supplementation in women 
undergoing ART. AEs of special interest due to the vaginal administration are also included as

This is an open -label trial .
3.5.4 Selection of Doses in the Trial
Subjects will be instructed to insert the first PVR on the day  after oocy te retrieval, which contains 
11mg progesterone/day  and remains in place a minimum of 23 hours/day  for 7 day s.
3.5.5
Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
A new PVR will b e inserted every  7 day s, with up to 10 PVRs used through Week 12 of pregnancy  
(10 weeks post -oocy te retrieval).
3.5.6 Discontinuation and Trial Stopping Criteria
Discontinuation Criteria
Two day s prior to oocy te retrieval, a TVUS will be performed to assess follicle size. A subject must 
have at least 2 follicles ≥17 mm (mean of 2 dimensions) to receive the hCG trigger. Subjects who 
do not reach this threshold after 20 day s of stimulation are to be discontinued from the trial.If the 
estradiol level is ≥5000 pg/mL, hCG should not be administered and the subject should be 
discontinued from the trial.
A serum pregnancy  test will be conducted 2, 2.5, and 3 weeks after the oocy te retrieval. Subjects 
with a β -hCG level <5 mIU/mL will be discontinued from the trial .A TVUS will be performed to 
document the presence of an intrauterine gestational sac 4.5 weeks after oocy te retrieval. If it is 
determined that the subject has an ectopic pregnancy , the subject will be treated according to the 
site’s standard protocol and will be withdrawn from the trial.
Subjects who discontinue the trialare to complete an Earl y Withdrawal Visit (section 6.3.8) no later 
than 1 week after the last dose of the IMP. An End of Trial Visit (section 6.4
) is required 2 weeks 
after the last dose of IMP.

4.4 Withdrawal Criteria
Withdrawal from Trial
Every  subject has the right to withdraw from the trial at an y time for any  reason, without the need 
to justify  their decision .A subject's participation is to terminate immediately  upon her request.
However, t he Investigator should 
record the reason for the subject’s withdrawal, if possible.
If, at the time of discontination , a dose of the IMP has already been administered, the subject must 
be advised to consider follow -up safet y investigations , which will include all procedures outlined 
for the Early  Withdrawal Visit (section 6.3.8).
The subject can also be withdrawn from the trialat an y time at the discretion of the Investigator; the 
reason should be discussed with the Sponsor prior to discontinuation . For any  discontinuation, the 
Investigator will obtain all the required details and document the date of the premature termination 
and the main reason in the source documents and eCRF.
A subject who withdraws from the trialafter embry o transfer will not be replaced.
Withdrawal of Consent
If the subject withdraws her consent, data collected up to withdrawal will remain in the database , 
but no further data will be collected. Samples and recordings obtained before withdrawal may  be 
analyzed. This will be described in the Informed Consent Documents. The subject can request 
destruction of samples which would otherwise have been kept in sto rage.

has an ectopic pregnancy, the subject will be treated according to the site’s standard protocol and will 
be withdrawn from the trial. 
If it is determined that the subject has a heterotopic pregnancy , the subject will be treated according to 
the site’s standard prot ocol and may  remain in the trial at the discretion of the I nvestigator.
7.1.2 Spontaneous Abortion
Spontaneous abortion is defined as twopositive β -hCG test s occurrin g at least two day s apart on or 
after 2 weeks post -oocy te retrieval, but followed by  observation of an y empty  intrauterine gestational 
sac (blighted ovum), intrauterine gestation without a fetal heart beat, or absence of viable fetuses, as 
documented b y ultrasound.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL8 ADVERSE EVENTS
8.1 Adverse Event Definition
An adverse event (AE) is any  untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial.
It includes:
Any unfavourable and unintended sign, s ymptom or disease temporally  associated with the use 
of the IMP, whether or not considered to be caused by  the IMP.
AEs commonly  observed and AEs anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of the IMP.
Any laboratory  abnormality , vital sign, or finding from phy sical or gy necological examination 
assessed as clinically  significant by  the Investigator (Note: pre-existing conditions diagnosed 
through assessments and examinations at the sc reening visit or during the screening period are 
not AEs, but are recorded as medical history ).
Accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug and/or dose), reasons for an y 
medical, nursing or pharmacy  consultation, or reasons for admissio n to hospital or surgical 
procedures.
Overdoses and medication errors with and without clinical consequences.
All AEs will be coded b y Ferring Global Pharmacovigilance using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) (the version effective at trial start).
8.2 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events
8.2.1 Collection of Adverse Events
The Investigator must monitor the condition of the subject throughout the trial from the time of 
obtaining informed consent until the last visit ( End-of- trial).
The sources of AEs cover:
The subject’s response to questions about her health (a standard non -
leading question such as 
“How have you been feeling since your last visit?” is asked at each visit).
Symptoms spontaneously  reported by  the subject.
Investigations and examinations where the findings are assessed b y the Investigator to be 
clinically  significant changes or abnormalities.
Other information relating to the subject’s health becoming known to the Investigator 
(e.g., hospitaliz ation).

The Investigator must record all AEs in the AE Log provided in each subject’s eCRF with information 
about:
AE description
Date and time of onset (time can be omitted, if not applicable)
Intensit y
Causal relationship to I MP
Action taken to IMP
Other action taken
Date and time of outcome (time can be omitted, if not applicable)
Outcome
Seriousness.
Each of the items in the AE L og is described in detail in the following sections.
Adverse Event
AEs should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, s eparate signs and sy mptoms should be 
recorded. One diagnosis/sy mptom should be entered per record.
If a subject suffers from the same AE more than once and the subject recovers in between the events, 
the AEs should be recorded separatel y.If an AE changes in intensity , a worst -case approach should be 
used when recording the event, i.e., the highest intensity  and the longest duration of the event.1
Note the following: a procedure is not an AE; the reason for conducting the procedure is.
Hospitalization is not an AE; the reason for hospitalization is. Death is not an AE, but the cause of 
death is (an exception is sudden death of unknown cause, which is an AE).
                                                
1Exception: if an AE with onset before the first IMP administration (i.e., a pretreatment AE) w orsens in intensity, 
this must be recorded as 2 separate events. The initial AE should be recorded w ith outcome “not recovered” and 
the date and time of outco me are w hen the intensity changed. The second AE should be recorded w ith date and 
time of onset when the intensity changed.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALDate and Time of Onset
The date of onset is the date when the first sign(s) or sy mptom(s) were first noted. If the AE is an 
abnormal clinicall y significant laboratory test or outcome of an examination, the onset date is the date 
the sample was taken or the examination was performed. 
Intensity
The intensity  of an AE must be classified using the following 3- point scale:
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity.
Moderate: Event sufficient to affect usual activity  (disturbing).
Severe: Inability  to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable).
The grading of AEs of special interest will be based on predefined criteria as discussed i n section 8.3.
Causal Relationship to IMP
The possibility  of whether the IMP caused the A E must be classified as one of the following:
Reasonable possibility : There is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between 
the IMP and the AE. The AE may  occur as part of the pharmacological 
action of the IMP or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.
Examples: 
AEs that are uncommon but are known to be strongl y associated with IMP exposure.
AEs that are not commonly  associated with IMP exposure, but the event occurs in association 
with other factors strongly suggesting causation, such a s a strong temporal association or the 
event recurs on rechallenge with the IMP .
No reasonable possibility: There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IMP and the AE.
Examples:
Known consequences of the underl ying disease or condition under investigation.
AEs common in the trial population, which are also anticipated to occur with some frequency 
during the course of the trial, regardless of IMP exposure.

If medication is administered to treat the AE, this medication shoul d be entered in the Concomitant 
Medication Log .
Date and Time of Outcome
The date and time (time can be deleted/omitted, if not applicable) the subject recovered or died.
Outcome
The outcome of an AE must be classified as oneof the following:
Recovered (f ully recovered or the condition has returned to the level observed at initiation of 
trial treatment)
Recovered with sequelae (resulted in persistent or significant disability /incapacity )
Recovering (the event is improving)

of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that may have caused 
death if it were more severe.
requires inpatient hospitalization 
or prolongation of existing 
hospitalizationThe term hospitalization means that the subject w as admitted to hospital or that 
existing hospitalization was extended as a result of an event. Hospitalization 
describes a period of at least 24 hours. An overnight stay for observation, a stay at 
an emergency room, or treatment on an outpatient basis does not constitute a 
hospitalization. How ever, m edical judgement must alw ays be exercised, and when 
in doubt, the case should be considered serious (i.e., if case fulfills the criterion for 
a medically important event). Hospitalizations for administrative or social purposes 
do not constitute a SAE .Hospital admissions and/or su rgical operations planned 
before trial inclusion are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the subject w as enrolled in the trial, provided that the condition did not deteriorate 
during the trial.

norm al life functions. If in doubt, the decision should be left to medical judgement 
by the Investigator.

is an important m edical event Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other 
situations should be considered serio us such as important m gedical events that 
might not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but 
might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the definition above. Ex amples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.

8.5.1 Follow -up of Adverse Events with Onset during the Trial
During the trial, from the time of obtaining informed consent until the end-of- trial visit (for each 
subject individually ), the Investi gator must follow -up on each AE until it is resolved or until the 
medical condition of the subject is stable.
After the subject’s last trialvisit, the I nvestigator must follow -up on any  AE classified as serious or 
considered to have a reasonable possible causalit y to the I MP until it is resolved or until the medical 
condition of the subject is stable. All such relevant follow -up information must be reported to Ferring.
If the event is a chronic condition, the I nvestigator and Ferring may  agree that further follow -up is not 
required.
8.5.2 Follow -up of Adverse E vents on N on-Investigational M edicinal Products During the 
Trial
In case an AE is recognised as an adverse drug reaction caused by  a concomitant NI MP, investigators 
should report to each Marketing Authorisa tion Holder. For adverse drug reactions caused b y an NIMP 
where Ferring is the Marketing Authorisation Holder, the case will have to be reported to Ferring.
8.5.3 Collection of Serious Adverse Events with Onset after Last Visit in the Trial
If an Investigator be comes aware of an SAE after the subject’s last visit, and he/she assesses the SAE 
to have a reasonable possible causality to the IMP, the case will have to be reported to Ferring, 
regardless of how long after the end of the trial this takes place.

The statistical anal yses will be detailed in a separate Statistical Analy sis Plan.
9.1 Primary Analysis
At the final anal ysis, the cumulative rate of any  spontaneous abortion, including spontaneous clinically  
recognized pregnancy  loss and blighted ovum during the trial (up to Week 12 following oocy te 
retrieval), in subjects treated with PVR following fresh e mbryo transfer will be estimated (i.e.,
modified intention -to-treat [ mITT]population) . 
The number and rate of any  spontaneous abortions (occurring on or before 12 weeks following oocyte 
retrieval) for subjects in the mITT cohort will be summarized and th e associated two -sided exact 95% 
confidence interval will be generated. Upon generating the two -sided exact 95% confidence interval, 
the upper bound of the interval will be assessed for whether it excludes or fails to exclude a 
spontaneous abortion rate of 15%.
9.2 Determination of Sample Size
In this safet y trial, the primary assessment of interest is on the number of subjects that experience a 
spontaneous abortion. Because this is a single- arm trial, all subjects that enter the mITT anal ysis 
population will h ave been treated with the investigational product, PVR. The primary  anal ysis involves 
the construction of a two -sided 95% exact confidence interval surrounding the proportion of subjects in 
the m ITT anal ysis population that experience a spontaneous abortio n. The upper bound of said 
confidence interval is then compared with the threshold of a 15% spontaneous abortion rate.
Statistical simulations have been performed to understand the operating characteristics under vary ing 
assumptions for both the sample siz e of the m ITT anal ysis population and the “true” proportion of 
spontaneous abortions. For each simulation rep etition , a sample of subjects was simulated using the 
binomial distribution and a given pair of sample size and “true” proportion of spontaneous ab ortions 
assumptions. A two -sided 95% exact confidence interval wasthen created based on the simulated data 
and the upper bound of this confidence interval wascompared to the threshold of 0.15 ( corresponding 
toa spontaneous abortion rate of 15%). If the upper bound of the two-sided 95% exact confidence 
interval wasless than 0.15, the simulation repetition was declared a “success”. If, however, the upper 
bound of the two -sided 95% exact confidence interval wasgreater than or equal to 0.15, the simulation
repetition was declared a “failure”. This process wasrepeated 10,000 times for each combination of 
assumed sample size and “true” proportion of spontaneous abortions. The proportion of simulation 
repetition successes to the total number of simulation rep etitions then describe dthe power of the 
proposed trialgiven the pair of assumptions.

9.7.1 General Considerations
Continuous variables will be described with the number of non -missing values, mean, standard 
deviation, median, and minimum/maximum values. Categorical variables will be described with the 
number and percentage of subjects within each level. All confidence intervals will be 95% confidence 
intervals.
9.7.2 Primary Endpoint
The primary  endpoint is the cumulative rate of any spontaneous abortion occurring on or before 
12weeks following oocyte retrieval in all subjects treated with PVR and undergoing fresh embry o 
transfer. Spontaneous a bortion is defined as 
twopositive β-hCG test s occurring at least two day s apart
on or after 2 weeks post -oocy te retrieval, but followed by  observation of any  empt y intrauterine 
gestational sac (blighted ovum), intrauterine gestation without a fetal heart beat, or absence of viable 
fetuses, as documented by  ultrasound.
In addition to the anal ysis specified in section 9.1, t he number and rates of any spontaneous abortions 
(occurring on or before 12 weeks following oocy te retrieval) in all subjects in the mI TT cohort will be 
analyzed as a sensitivity  anal ysis using a Bay esian hierarchical model to dy namically  borrow 
information from the D R-PGN -302 study . 
The cumulative rate of any  spontaneous abortion from Study  
DR-PGN -302 was 55/549 (10.2%). Dy namic borrowing between this prior data and the current trial’s 
data allow borrowing to occur to the extent indicated by  these two observed rates. More b orrowing 
occurs when the rates are similar while less when they
 differ. Full modeling details are provided 
in Appendix 6 .
9.7.3 Secondary Endpoints
9.7.3.1 Sponta neous Abortion within 6 and 10 Weeks of Oocyte Retrieval
The frequency and proportion of subject s that have any  spontaneous abortion during the trialwithin 6 
and 10 weeks post -oocy te retrieval will be derived for subjects in the mITT and safet y cohorts for 
subject s that had ooct yte retrieved. Associated 95 % confidence intervals will also be presented.
9.7.3.2 Biochemical Abortions within 6 and 10 Weeks of Oocyte Retrieval
Biochemical abortion is defined as a positive β -hCG test at 2 weeks and 2 weeks + 3 -4 day s post-
oocy te retrieval, but followed by  no observed gestational sac on a later TVUS , or followed b y a 
negative β-hCG test.The frequency  and proportion of subject s that have biochemical abortion within 
6and 10 weeks post -oocy te retrieval will be derived fo r subjects in the mITT and safety  cohorts for 
subject s that had oocy te(s)retrieved. Associated 95% confidence intervals will also be presented.

Ectopic and heterotopic pregnancies will be reported as AEs. The frequency  and proportion of subjects 
with ectopic and heterotopic pregnancies will be summarized .
9.7.3.4 Positive β -hCG
Positive β -hCG 
is defined as a positive serum β- hCG test at 2 weeks and 2 weeks + 3 -4 day spost-
oocy te retrieval. The positive β- hCG rate will be derived for subjects in the mI TT and safety  cohorts 
for subjects that had oocy te(s) retrieved . Associated 95% confidence intervals for these event rate 
estimates will also be presented.
Subjects who do not have both β -hCG tests due to missing data, earl y withdraw al, or any  other reason 
will be counted as not having positive β -hCG unless a positive result is observed at a later pregnancy  
assessment. For example, if the outcome of these β- hCG tests is missing and a TVUS confirms clinical 
pregnancy  at a later date then β-hCG will be imputed as ‘positive’.
9.7.3.5 Clinical Pregnancy
Clinical pregnancy  is defined as a TVUS showing at least 1 intrauterine gestational sac with fetal heart 
beat at 6 and 10 weeks post- oocy te retrieval. The frequency  and proportion of subject s that are 
clinically  pregnant at 6 and 10 weeks post -oocy te retrieval will be derived for subjects in the mITT and 
safet y cohorts for subject s that had oocy te(s)retrieved .Associated 95 % confidence intervals for these 
event rate estimates will also be presented .
For the clinical pregnancy  rate derivation at 6 weeks post -oocy te retrieval, if a subject has missing 
TVUS assessment and no other TVUS assessment at a later date, the subject will be counted as not 
having a clinical pregnancy . In contrast, if there is a later assessment with at least 1 intrauterine 
gestational sac with fetal heart beat , the subject will be imputed as having a clinical pregnancy  at 6 
weeks post-oocy te retrieval.

category  of pronuc lei will be presented (i.e., >2 pn, 2 pn, 1 pn, 0 pn and damaged). The percentage 
derivation will be over the total number of oocy
tes classified. 
These summaries will be obtained for mITT and ES cohorts.
9.7.4.5 Quality of Blastocysts 5 Days (Day 5) after Oocyte Retrieval
The quality  of blastocy sts 5 day s after oocy te retrieval will be assessed at both the blastocy st level and 
at the subject level. The evaluation of fertilized oocy tes at Day  5 will consist of assessment of embry o
stage and classification of blastocy sts according to blastocy st expansion and hatching status, blastocy st 
inner cell mass grading and trophectoderm grading. Furthermore, the destiny  of the embry o will be

4.An expanded blastocy st with a blastocoel volume larger than that of the early  
embry o, with a thinning zona
5.A hatching blastocy st with the trophectoderm starting to herniate th rough the zona
6.A hatched blastocy st, in which the blastocy st has completely  escaped from the zona
For blastocy sts with e xpansion and hatching status on Day  5
, blastocy st inner cell mass grading and 
trophectoderm grading will be evaluated.
Blastocy st inner cell mass grading will be assessed as one of the following:
A.Tightly  packed, many  cells

11.1 Periodic Monitoring
The monitor will contact and visit the Investigator periodicall y to ensure adherence to the protocol, 
ICH-Good Clinical Practice ( GCP), standard operating procedures and applicable regulatory  
requirements, maintena nce of trial -related source records, completeness, accuracy ,and verifiability  of 
eCRF entries compared to source data, verification of drug accountability ,and compliance with safety  
reporting instructions .
The Investigator will permit the monitor direct access to all source data, including electronic medical 
records, and/or documents in order to facilitate data verification .The Investigator will cooperate with 
the monitor to ensure that any  discrepancies that may  be identified are resolved .The Investiga toris 
expected to be able to meet the monitor during these visits. When the first subject is enrolled at the trial 
site, a monitoring visit will take place shortl y afterwards. For this trial, the frequency of the monitoring 
visits per site will be determined by  the enrolment rate.
The source data verification process and definition of key  variables to be monitored and the monitoring 
strategy  will be described in detail in the Monitoring Plan for the trial.
11.2 Audit and Inspection
The Investigator will make all the trial- related source data and records available at any time to quality -
assurance auditor(s) mandated b y Ferring, or to domestic/foreign regulatory inspectors or 
representatives from IRBs who may audit/inspect the trial.
The main purposes of an audit or inspection are to assess compliance with the trial protocol and the 
principles of ICH -GCP ,including the Declaration of Helsinki and all other relevant regulations.
The subjects must be informed by  the Investigator and in the i nformed consent documents that 
authori zed Ferring representatives and representatives from regulatory  authorities and I RBs may  wish 
to inspect their medical records. During audits/inspections ,the auditors/inspectors may  copy relevant 
parts of the medical records. No persona l identification , apart from the screening number , will appear 
on these copies.
The Investigator should notify  Ferring without any  delay  of an y inspection b y a regulatory authority or 
IRB.

Hierarchical Modeling Details
Define n1as the number of subjects in the current trialand Y1ias the indicator of spontaneous 
abortion for the ithsubject in the current trial where Y 1~ Bin(n 1, π1). Let π1be the true rate of 
spontaneous abortions in the current trial.
The previous trial (Study DR -PGN -302) reported a spontaneous rate of abortion of 55/549. This 
prior information about abortion rate is incorporated into the modeling framework through a 
hierarchical model. Dynamic borrowing between this trial’s resu lts and the current trial’s data 
allows borrowing to occur to the extent indicated by these two data sources. More borrowing occurs 
when the two rates are similar while less borrowing occurs when they  differ. This “d ynamic” 
borrowing property  is distinct f rom other approaches which use a fixed informative prior or apriori 
assume an amount of borrowing between these two data sources. Let Y 0~ Bin(n0=549 , π0)where 
π0
is the true rate of spontaneous abortions from the previous trial.
We transform to the logit scale for modeling purposes. Let 1=log(π1/(1- π 1)) and 0=log(π0/(1-
π0)). The hierarchical model assumes that 0and1 have an across studies distribution:
1,0  ~ N( , 2)
The across trial mean and variance 2are unknown and hence have a prior distribution which is 
combined with the data to produce estimates of and 2:
~N(–
2.2, 2.25)
2~ IG(0.125,0.005)
The mean parameter assumes a relativel y vague prior on the original scale and centered at 10%. 
The var iance component 2controls the degr ee of borrowing among studies. 
Small values of 2
result in a greater degree of borrowing while large values of 2correspond to less borrowing. The 
parameter 2is estimated using the data, so the observed between studi es variation is a key  
component of the model behavior. The prior specification on 2corresponds to an inverse -gamma 
distribution with mean 0.2 and weight 0.25.

Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALOperating Characteristics
The planned sample size is based only  on subjects that undergo fresh embryo transfer. No further 
drop-outs are assumed. The anal ysis is evaluated across a range of true effects for the current trial’s 
spontaneous abortion rate. For the null scenario where in truth the PVR spontaneous abortion rate is 
15%, 100,000 sets of tr ials were simulated. For all other assumed scenarios, 5,000 sets of trials 
were simulated.
Overall Success
We evaluated the overall probability that the 95% credible interval is entirely  below 15% for each 
scenario of the true PVR rate. If PVR trul y mainta ins an abortion rate below 15%, then this 
represents the power for achieving a credibl e interval entirel y below 15%. If the true rate of 
abortions for PVR is 15%, then obtaining a credible interval entirel y below 15% is the type I error. 
Results are provid ed in the table below.
True PVR Rate 8% 9% 10% 11% 12% 13% 14% 15%
Trial Success 0.979 0.933 0.830 0.670 0.485 0.297 0.167 0.084
When in truth the PV R spontaneous abortion rate is 9%, the trial has 93.3% power of achieving a 
95% credible interval entirely  below 15%. Alternatively , when in truth the spontaneous abortion 
rate is 15%, the trial has a 8.4% rate of success.
Inference Associated with Various Observed Rates
For various observed rates of spontaneous abortions, the corresponding primary analysis based on 
the hierarch ical model is described below. The posterior mean, 95% credible interval, effective 
number of borrowed subjects, and the borrowing percentage (out of the n= 549subjects from the 
previous trial ) is provided. The effective numbe r of borrowed subjects calculation [E( π1)*(1-
E(π1))/Var( π1)–1–240] is somewhat approximate as it is bas ed on the binomial likelihood. Results 
are provided in the below table.
Observed Data Estimated Rate (%) 
(95% CI)Effective Number of 
Borrowed SubjectsBorrowing 
Percentage
19/240 (7.92 %) 8.6% ( 5.7, 11.7 ) 103 18.9%
24/240 (10.00 %) 10.0 % (7.2, 13.3 ) 130 23.7%
36/240 (15.00 %) 13.8 % (10.1, 18.5 ) 9 1.7%
Borrowing based on the hierarchical modeling is dy namic, with higher borrowing achieved when 
the current trial’s results are similar to the previous data and minimal borrowing when the current 
trial’s results are at 15%. This is evidenced b y both the decre asing number of borrowed subjects 
and the increasing width of the credible intervals. Also, based on 240subjects being included in the 
analysis, the maximal number of observed responses which maintains a 95% credible interval 
entirely  below 15% is 28.

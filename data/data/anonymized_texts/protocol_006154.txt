all-cause mortality from randomization to Month 3 
Visit . 
 To assess  the saf ety of edoxaban with regard to the 
combination of major and CRNM  bleedings  
occurring during the Extension Period  (from Month 3 
Visit to last dose plus 30 days).  
 To assess  the efficacy of edoxaban  with regard to the 
development of symptomatic TE or asymptomatic 
intracardiac thrombus identified by cardiac imaging 
occurring  during the Extension Period .

Page 12  To compare the intra-patient  safety (Investigator 
reported bleeding) and efficacy (Investigator reported 
TE) during the Main Treatment Period  compared 
with the prior treatment occurring within 3 months of 
randomization . 
 To compare edoxaban regimen with available 
existing historical data  based on literature review and 
search for registered clinical trials with similar 
endpoints . 
 To analyze the  primary prevention and secondary 
prevention of  TE. 
Study Design:  This is a Phase 3, open -label, randomized,  parallel -group , 
multi center, obse rvational trial to evaluate safety and efficacy of 
edoxaban against SOC.  The adjudication of the efficacy and 
safety endpoints will be conducted by a blinded adjudication 
committee.  
The study includes two periods:  
 The Main Treatment Period is defined as t he time 
from randomization, until the end of Month  3 of 
treatment.  
 Subjects who discontinue  treatment  from  the 
Main  Treatment Period  prior to Month 3 will 
continue to  be followed monthly  according to the 
Schedule of Events  (Table  17.1) through the 
Month 3 visit (Visit  5) and have a 30 -day Follow -
Up Visit . If treatment discontinuation occurs 
prior to Month 2 visit, t he 30 -day Follow -Up 
Visit  will occur on the same day as the Month 3 
visit.  
 Subjects who complete the Main Treatment  
Period  (Month 3)  but do not continue into the  
Extension Period  will have a  Month 3 Visit and 
with a Follow -Up Visit  30 days after last dose  of 
study drug , and discontinued from the study . 
 Subjects who withdraw from the study (meaning 
the subject can no longer participate in the study 
due to withdrawal of consent ) will have an 
attempted Follow -Up Visit  phone call 3 months 
from date of randomization to  ascertain if any 
events (TE and/or bleeding events) have occurred 
since withdrawal.

Page 13  The Extension Period  is discretionary for the  subject 
based on the Investigator ’s judgment of risk burden 
and will include treatment from the  end of the Ma in 
Treatment Period (Month  3, Visit  5) up through the 
end of Month 12 (Visit  8). All subjects  entering the 
Extension Period  will be given ed oxaban for the 
duration of the E xtension  Period . 
 All subjects after Month 3 will be provided with 
edoxaban at the dosage appropriate for the subject’s 
age and weight.  
 Subjects who discontinue the treatment  and study  
at any time after Month 3 will have a 
Discontinuation Visit  performed  with a 
subsequent 30 -day Follow -Up. 
 Subjects who complete Extension Period  
treatment at Month 12 (Visit 8) will have a 
Follow -Up Visit,  30 days after last dose of study 
drug (Visit 9).  
Subjects who require anticoagulant treatment after 
discontinuation of the study treatment at any time will be 
transitioned to a therapy as determ ined by the Investigator . After 
subjects are assessed for eligibility to participate in the study per 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria , they will be:  
 Stratified by:  
 Type of u nderlying heart disease  
 Kawasaki disease  
 Fontan surgery  
 Heart failure   
 Others (which can include post -surgical 
procedures for congenital heart disease s other  
than Fontan surgery)  
 Subjects with underlying disease other than 
Kawasaki will be further stratified by 
concomitant use of low dose aspirin (1 to 
5 mg/kg/day)  
 About 150 subject s will be recruited globally and be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio (edoxaban:SOC, 
respectively) into 1 of 2 treatment arms:

combination):  
 Heparin, including unfractionated heparin 
(UFH) or low molecular weight heparin 
(LMWH )  
 Vitamin K antagonist (V KA) with potential 
bridging with heparin based therapy until 
VKA international normalized ratio ( INR) is

Locally sourced SOC is the preferred option for th e study.  
However, centrally sourced SOC can be provided when country 
or clinical site requirements deem it necessary.  
Subjects from 1 to <18 years of age will be enrolled in the study 
as soon as the dosing regimen is established for each age cohort 
in the Phase 1 single -dose U157 study. U157 has 5 dosing age 
cohorts  which are  similar to  this study : 
 Ages 12 to <18 years  
 Ages 6 to <12 years  
 Ages 2 to <6 years  
 Ages 6 months to <2 years  
(In Cohort 4 [6 months to <2 years ], enrollment 
may open after the protocol data requirement for 
Indepen dent Data Monitoring Committee 
[IDMC ] review for subject s less than 1 year old 
[from study U157 ] is met and the IDMC reviews 
and approves the data . Sites will be notified that 
enrollment of subjects 6 month  old to <1  year old 
may also open.)  
 Ages birth to <6 months.  
A review of safety data of 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75% of subjects 
completing the Main Treatment P eriod of 3  months will be 
performed on a routine basis by the IDMC . In addition, the 
IDMC will review the edoxaban exposure analysis and safety

Additionally, in U313,  subjects less than 1 year of age will be 
admitted to the study after review by the IDMC of safety data of 
50% of subjects in the 1 to < 18 years age group  who have 
completed the Main Treatment P eriod of 3  months (50 subjects 
in edoxaban arm and 25 subjects in SOC arm).   
The older cohort (12 to <18 years of age) will receive tablets  (15 
and/or 30 mg strength, see Table  5.1) or be offered granules for 
oral suspension  if swallowing is an issue . Subjects 6 to <12 
years of age may take edoxaban tablets or edoxaban granules for 
oral suspension , which will provide more flexibility to adjust 
mg/kg dose . All subjects < 6 years old will receive edoxaban 
granules oral suspension  (see Table  5.1). Subjects will  be 
instructed to take the edo xaban  dose orally once a day, at the 
same time every day, preferably in the morning, with or without 
food.  One bottle of edoxaban granules will be used for each 
dosing day . Tablets should be swallowed with a glass of water .  
Study Duration:  The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 3 
years.  
The total duration of study participation for any individual 
subject will be a minimum of 4 months (3 -month Main 
Treatment Period and 30 -day Follow -Up) and maximum of 13 
months (3 -month Main Treatment Period, 9 -month Extension 
Period  and 30 -day Follow -Up). 
Clinical  Sites  and Location:  This study wil l be conducted in North America, European 
Union , and Rest of the World (ROW) .

Dosage Form, Dose and Route 
of Administration:  Randomization to Edoxaban -Treatment Arm  
Edoxab an treatment will be  packaged and dispensed to the 
subject on a monthly schedule , even though after Month 3 the 
clinic visitation schedule is every 3 months . For subjects who 
cannot pick up their study therapy on a monthly basis , 
accommodations will be made to allow t he Investigator to 
distribute  up to  a 3-month supply of study drug to match the 
scheduled study visit interval.  
The following dosage forms will b e provided for this study:  
 Edoxaban 15  mg and 30 mg tablets  
 Edoxaban granules for oral suspension 60 mg are 
provided in individual bottles . Granules will be 
reconstituted in 8 mL water to provide a 6  mg/mL 
liquid suspension) . One bottle will be used for each 
daily dose.  
For subjects 12 to <18 years old;  
 60 mg dose will be dispensed as two 30 mg tablets  or 
as 10 mL from an individual bottle of oral suspension 
60 mg  
 45 mg dose will be dispensed as one 30 mg tablet 
plus one 15 mg tablet  or as 7.5 mL from an 
individual bottle of oral suspension 60 mg  
 30 mg dose will be dispensed as one 30 mg tablet  or 
as 5 mL from an individual bottle of oral suspension 
60 mg   
 Doses provide d by the granulation formulation will 
be dispensed with a dosing syringe according to the 
recommended dose shown in Table  5.1. One bottle 
will be used for each daily dose.  
 If a subject does not have the capacity to swallow 
tablets in the 12  to <18 year old or 6 to <12 year old 
group , the tablets may be crushed and served with 
applesauce or mixed with 2 to 3 ounces of water and

Page 20 immediately administered by mouth or through a n 
existing  gastric  tube, if needed . 
For subjects 6 to <12 years old;  
 60 mg dose will be dispensed as two 30 mg tablets or 
as 10 mL from an individual bottle of oral suspension 
60 mg.  
 45 mg dose will be dispensed as one 30 mg tablet 
plus one 15 mg tablet or as 7.5 mL from an 
individual bottle of oral suspension 60 mg.  
 Dose other than 45mg and 60mg provided by the 
granulation formulation will be dispensed with a 
dosing syringe according to the recommended dose 
shown in Table  5.1. One bottle will be used for each 
daily dose.  
Subjects younger than 6 years of age will only receive edoxaban 
granules for oral suspension , which will give more flexibility to 
adjust mg/kg do se. Doses for all age groups will be selected to 
elicit target exposures comparable to those achieved from  the 
adult Phase 3 study  of 60 mg.  Table  5.1 indicates the edoxaban 
doses to be given for subjects of the ages 2 to <18 years of age.  
Doses for all subsequent age cohorts will be by separate 
notification to the investigative sites outside the content of this 
protocol  after the IDM C has approved the pr oposed edoxaban 
doses and safety data from the U157 study . 
Pediatric d osing regimen will be determined from Phase 1 
single -dose U157 study. 
Additionally, there is ongoing review  of safety data of 10%, 
25%, 50% , and 75% of  subjects completing Month 3 of the 
study by the IDMC in the U313 study.  
Subjects will be instructed to take edoxaban (tablets or granules) 
orally once a day, at the same time every day, preferably in the 
morning , with or without food.  Tablets should be swallowed 
with a glass of water.  Doses provided from the granulation 
formulation will be provided by a dosing syringe . One bottle 
will be used for each daily dose.  
Edoxaban dosage regimen will be reduced (see Section  5.3.1 ) 
for the following reasons . Refer to Table  5.1 for dosing 
instruction for subjects of age 2 to <18 years of age : 
 Body Weight :

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 21  For subjects 12 to <18 year s old  with body 
weight <5th percentile of subject’s age (see 
Appendix  17.11  ), edox aban doses will be 
permanently changed  
 For subjects 12 to <18 years old  with body 
weight ≥60 kg, will receive edoxaban 60 mg.  
However, if the body weight is ≥30 - <60 kg, 
edoxaban dose would be 45 mg daily. If the 
patient body weight ≥60 kg, then edoxaba n dose 
would be escalated to 60 mg daily . 
 For subjects <12 year olds: Doses will be 
provided by mg/kg or a dose may be suggested, 
subsequent to exposure modeling, based on an 
age range (see Table  5.1). 
 Moderate renal impairment (eGFR) ≥30% to ≤50% 
of normal for the subject’s age and size at 
randomization as determined by the age appropriate 
formula : Cockcroft -Gault equation for pediatric 
subjects ≥12 years of age and modified Schwartz 
equation for pediatric subjec ts <12 years of age) 
(Appendix  17.9). If a subject experiences a change in 
renal func tion from normal to eGFR ≥30% to ≤50% 
after randomization, the measurement will be 
repeated within 1 week.  If the repeat measurement 
confirms the decrease, the edoxaban dose will be 
reduced permanently.  
 Additionally, if a subject requires concomitant 
admin istration of a certain P -glycoprotein (P -gp) 
inhibitor ( Appendix  17.6.1  ), the edoxaban dose will 
be reduced during P -gp administration and re -
establ ished to the original dose once P -gp inhibitor 
administration had concluded.  
Randomization to Standard of Care Treatment Arm  
SOC randomized subjects will be trea ted with SOC though 
Month 3 (Visit 5) then offered edoxaban through Month 12  
(Visit 8) . SOC  treatment will be packaged and  dispensed to the 
subject on a monthly visit schedule . After Month 3 , all subjects 
will be transitioned to edoxaban at the appropriate dose for their 
age and weight.   
Local Sourcing of SOC :

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 22 Local SOC sourcing  is the primary m ethod for providing 
heparin and/or VKA : 
The SOC will be provided by the Investigator . Alternatively, 
local supply depots within each country will provide SOC 
directly to the clinical sites.  Subject will be treated with heparin 
(UFH or LMWH ), and/or VKA according to the clinical site’s 
SOC treatment regimen (see Section  5.2). 
Note: If standard practice for bridging VKA to therapeutic levels 
is achieved with a heparin based treatment, the clinical  site will 
be responsible for pr oviding the bridging therapy to  subjects 
randomized to VKA.  
Central/Sponsor Sourcing:  
If there are reg ulatory or site hurdles providing the SOC  locally , 
the Sponsor will provide SOC only as LMWH  (enoxaparin ) or 
VKA ( warfarin ) as follows:  
 Enoxaparin  Subjects will be treated with 
enoxaparin alone or can be switched to warfarin 
anytime during the study tre atment period.  
 Enoxaparin (LMWH) will be provided a s 
solution for subcutaneous  injection in pre -filled 
syringes with only  60 mg/0.6 mL, 80  mg/0.8 mL , 
or 100 mg/1 mL concentration for injection , or as 
multiple dose vials (for subjects <20  kg) for 
injection . 
 Warfarin (VKA) will be supplied as tablets (0.5  mg, 
1 mg, and 3  mg). 
Note:  Clinical  sites or treating physicians will provide aspirin 
(as per local SOC  practice) . 
Study Endpoints:  All safety and efficacy endpoints described will be  adjudicated 
in a blinded manner by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC).  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee  (IDMC ) will 
monitor safety th roughout the duration of the study.

1.1. Background  
Children with cardiac diseases, including cardiomyopathy and congenital heart disease (CHD) 
constitute a major proportion of children seen in tertiary hospitals with thromboembolic disease.  
In addition, more than 80% of the children receiving primary anticoagulant prophylaxis are being 
treated for  complex CHD or severe acquired cardiac illnesses.  
In children with cardiac disease, thromboembolic disease develops as a result of altered 
hemodynamics, prosthetic materials, surgically damaged blood vessels, intravenous (IV) 
catheters, and cardiopulmonar y bypass.  To prevent this potential life -threatening complication, 
some categories of pediatric cardiac patients, including patients with Fontan circulation, severe 
cardiomyopathy, and mechanic heart valve prostheses, are treated with vitamin K antagonists  
(VKAs) or heparin.  
Many children with CHD require long -term thromboprophylaxis to decrease the morbidity and 
mortality secondary to the thromboembolic phenomenon.  The advances in medical and cardio -
surgical techniques have led to improved survival in chil dren with CHD; thus, the overall use of 
anticoagulation has increased.  The overall incidence of thrombotic complications in patients 
undergoing cardiac surgery for CHD remain s difficult to evaluate due t o a lack of data.  Giglia et 
al2 showed an incidence of clinically evident TE of 3.6% of 1930 total cardiac operations  
performed . More recently, Manlhiot et al3 revealed that 11% of cardiac operations over a 39 -
month period were complicated by TEs.  
1.2. Study Rationale  
Currently available anticoagulants have significant limitations  especially in the pediatric 
population.  At the moment, the commonly used agents for long -term anticoagulation in children 
are low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) and VKAs.  The important disadvantages of LMWH  
(such as enoxaparin)  are subcutaneous (SC) administration , thrombocytopenia , and therapeutic 
level management . Vitamin K antagonists (such as the coumarins: warfarin, acenocoumarol, or 
phenprocoumon) are indirect coagulation inhibitors, which act by blocking the vitamin K 
dependent liver synthesis of the plasma coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X.  These agents have 
been the only oral anticoagulants available for the last 50  years.  The use of VKAs is complicated 
by several inherent problems including a delayed onset of antit hrombotic action , a narrow 
therapeutic index that requires close labo ratory monitoring using the international normalized 
ratio ( INR), an unpredictable and va riable pharmacological response,  and food and drug 
interactions requiring frequent dosage adjustme nt. Monagle et al showed that 41% of all warfarin 
measurements were below the target range, which is not uncomm on in children taking warfarin4. 
Ther efore, there exists a need for a safe, effective, and more easily managed oral antithrombotic 
agent for the treatment of pediatric subjects with thromboembolic disease.  
Edoxaban is a n oral direct inhibitor of activated Factor X with predictable pharmacokin etics and 
pharmacodynamics.  As a result, anticoagulant effects are more likely to remain within the 
therapeutic range, thereby decreasing the likelihood of bleeding, and potentially removing the 
need for dose adjustment or frequent monitoring.  These advant ages may result in increased 
patient satisfaction and adherence compared with existing anticoagulants.

Page 40 In 2015, e doxaban was approved for the following indications in the U nited States:  
 To reduce the risk o f stroke and systemic embolism  in subjects with nonvalvular 
atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with limitation of use in patients with creatinine clearance 
(CrCl ) >95 mL/min.  
 Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following 5 
to 10 days of initial therapy with a p arenteral anticoagulant.  
In the European Economic Area and Japan, edoxaban was approved  in 2015  for the following 
indications:  
 Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult subjects with NVAF with one or 
more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, 
diabetes mellitus, prior strok e or transient ischemic attack with no limitation of use.  
 Treatment of DVT and PE, and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults . 
As of 21 Oct 2018 , edoxaban is authorised in 45 countri es and is marketed in 30 countries 
worldwide . 
This study will compare the safety of edoxaban with the standard of care (SOC) treatment in 
pediatric subjects with cardiac disease who need anticoagulation to prevent primary and 
secondary thromboembolic disea se. Further data on edoxaban  development are  provided in the 
most recent Investigator ’s Brochure5.  
1.3. Risk/Benefit  
Although pediatric  subjects are at less risk than adults for the development of thromboembolic 
event  (TE), embolic disease remains an uncommon condition, but it does occur and is well 
described in children and adolescents with or without risk factors.  Thrombosis is an increasingly 
recognized complication occurring primarily in children with serious underlying conditions and 
most often associated with IV catheters ,6 and is also recognized in neonatal and pediatric  practice 
due to more sophisticated diagnostic tools being available.  In children with cardiac disease, 
thromboembolic disease develops as a result of altered hemodynamics, prosthetic materials, 
surgically damaged blood vessels, intravenous catheters, and cardiopulmonary bypass.  To 
prevent this potential life -threatening complication, some categories of pedi atric cardiac patients, 
including patients with  heart failure,  Fontan circulation, severe cardiomyopathy  (Kawasaki 
disease) , and mechanic heart valve prostheses, are treated with less advanced therapy such as 
VKAs or heparin  which requires intensive therap eutic monitoring . 
Many children with CHD require long -term thromboprophylaxis to decrease the morbidity and 
mortality secondary to the thromboembolic phenomenon.  The advances in medical and cardio -
surgical techniques have led to improved survival in childr en with CHD; thus, the overall use of 
anticoagulation has increased.  The overall incidence of thrombotic complications in patients 
undergoing cardiac surgery for CHD remains difficult to evaluate due to a lack of data.  Giglia et 
al2 showed an incidence of clinically evident TE of 3.6% of 1930 total cardiac operations 
performed.  More recently, Manlhiot et al3 revealed that 11% of cardiac operations over a 39 -
month period were complicated by TEs.

Page 41 Symptomatic thrombotic manifestation is recorded in 0.07/10,000 children, 
5.3/10,000  admissions of children and 24/10,000 admissions of newborns to intensive care 
units .1,7,8 According to the U.K. registry (British Pediatric  Surveillance Unit), the estimated 
incidence of thromboembolic e vents was 0.07/10,000 children (excluding stroke), wit h 89% 
having venous involvement7. Besides the greater awareness, an objective increase in childhood 
thrombosis is attributed to medical advances in the treatment of critically ill patients.  This 
seemingly contradictory observation is readily explained by the increasing use of central 
catheterization and innovative interventional procedures in t he treatment of premature infants, 
neonates and older children who are critically ill, suffering from complex cardiac defects, and 
from malignant disease, respectively.   
Safety and effectiveness of edoxaban development is an ongoing program with 2 Phase 3 studies  
in the pediatric  population  (venous thromboembolism  [VTE -U312 study ] and arterial 
thromboembolism  [ATE -U313 study ]). In principle, based on current adult data obtained on 
edoxaban, edoxaban is also cons idered to be suitable for the pediatric  popula tion and supported 
by the FDA and EMA request for pediatric studies in select populations .  
The DU176b -A-U157  study  (currently ongoing in the US, Canada , and Rest of the W orld 
[ROW] ) will evaluate and establish the pharmacokinetics (PK), the pharmacodynami cs (PD), the 
safety and tolerability of edoxaban in pediatric patients following single -dose oral 
administration.  It will also evaluate the palatability of the liquid oral suspension of edoxaban.  
Pediatric patients who are at risk of thromboembolic events and may need anticoagulation are 
eligible for inclusion in the study.  The goal of this study is to identify pediatric doses that are age 
appropriate and provides comparable exposure to adult efficacious doses to guide dose selection 
for the Phase 3 studies  in a pediatric population who have confirmed VTE (U312 study) or 
patients with cardiac disease at risk of thromboembolic events (U313 Study) which require 
anticoagulant therapy.  
The dose for 3 of the 5 age cohorts 12 to <18 , 6 to <12 , and 2 to <6 years has been defined from 
the U157 study, and age cohort enrollment in the U312 VTE study and U313 will be sequential 
based on the availability of data derived from U157.  Note: doses for age cohorts 6 months to  <2, 
and 38 weeks gestation to <6  months) ne ed to be defined.  No safety concerns related to study 
drug have been observed in these subjects . In addition, approximately 1 35 subjects (12  to <18 
years) and 35 subjects (6 to <12 years) as of April 2019 in the  Phase 3 U312 VTE study have 
been enrolled wi thout clinical s equelae as reviewed by the Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC).  
There  are potential benefits for trial participation as well as receipt of the study drugs in this 
open label design, as patient compliance and lifestyle will be impr oved by taking an oral 
medication compared to an injectable (enoxaparin) or and VKA which has therapeutic 
monitoring requirements and potential food interactions.  Indirect benefits to the patients enrolled 
in this trial are the free medical tests received at screening and during the study.  The data derived 
from this study could potentially benefit pediatric patients when the study data is disclosed and 
becomes publically available or lead to a possible update of the edoxaban drug label for pediatric 
use. 
The safety monitoring practices employed by this protocol, DU176b -C-U313 , (ie, physical 
examinations, vital signs, AEs, clinical laboratory and coagulation assessments, and urinalysis) 
Protocol  DU176b -C-U313

Page 42 are considered adequate to protect the patients’ safety.  The IDMC can recommend termination of 
the study based on concern about significantly higher bleeding risk relative to one of the study 
arms,  concern about drug -induced liver injury  or any other safety concern based on benefit/risk 
evaluation . Therefore, an y risk associated with participation in this trial is fully evaluated during 
the course of the trial by an IDMC to ensure patient risk is minimized.  
In conclusion, for the individual pediatric patient, any benefit associated with participation in this 
trial is based on the confirmed efficacy and safety profile of edoxaban compared to SOC in t he 
adult population from large Phase 3 studies, and the predicted benefit for the overall pediatric 
population.  Any risk is minimized, as the trial is an open label de sign, is highly monitored by an

to the patients enrolled in this study are the free medical tests received at screening and during 
the study.  However, the data  derived from this study could potentially benefit pediatric patients if 
it leads to an extension of the edoxaban label . This research may give rise to new or better  drug

2.1. Study Objectives  
2.1.1.  Primary Objectives  
The primary objective is to compare the safety of edoxaban with the SOC in pediatric subjects 
with cardiac diseases at risk of thromboembolic complications who need primary or secondary 
anticoagulant prophylaxis with regard to the combination of major and clinically relevant non -
major (CRNM) bleedings  per International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [ISTH] 
definition1 occurring in the Main Treatment Period: from the date of first dose of study drug to 
Month 3 Visit, or to the date of last dose of study drug plus 3 days if study treatment is 
discontinued , whichever is earlier .  
2.1.2.  Secondary Objectives  
2.1.2.1.  Key Secondary Objectives  
The key secondary objectives are:

activated Factor X ( FXa), will be assessed  as secondary endpoints  in edoxaban -treated subjects . 
Other biomarkers may be tested related to coagulation and/or edoxaban’s mechanism of action.  
2.3.5.  Quality of Life  Assessment  
A pediatric QOL  questionnaire will be issued at randomization and at the end of th e Main 
Treatment Period to assess such categories as: health and activities, feelings about themselves, 
relationships with others, and school behavior.  Note the QOL can be filled out by either a parent 
or the study participant.  The same person should compl ete the QOL at Month 3.

Page 48 The study includes 2 periods.  
 The Main Treatment Period is defined as the time from randomization, until the end 
of Month 3 of treatment.  
 Subjects who discontinue  treatment  from the Main Treatment Period prior to 
Month 3  will continue to be followed mont hly according to the Schedule of 
Events ( Appendix  17.1) through the Month 3 visit (Visit 5), and have a  30-day 
Follow -Up Visit . If treatment discontinuation occurs prior to Month 2 visit,  the 
30-day Follow -Up Visit  will occur on the same day as the Month 3 visit.   
 Subjects who complete the Main Treatment Period  (Month 3)  but do not continue 
into the Extension Period  will have a  Month 3 Visit an d a Follow -Up Visit , 30 
days after l ast dose of study drug  and be discontinued from the study . 
 Subjects who withdraw from the study  prior to Month 3  (meaning the subject can 
no longer participate in the study due to withdrawal consent ), will have  a Follow -
Up phone call 3 months from the date of randomization  to ascertain any events 
(TE and/or bleeding events) that may have occurred since withdrawal.  
 The Extension Period is discretionary for the subject based on the Investigator 
judgment of risk burden and will include treatment from the end of the Main 
Treatment Period (Month 3, Visit 5) up through the end of Month 12 (Visit 8). All 
subjects entering the Extension Period  will be given edoxaban for the duration of the 
Extension Period . 
 After Month 3, all subjects will be transitioned to edoxaban at the appropriate 
dose for their age and weight at informed consent . 
 Subjects who discontinue the treatment and study at any time after Month  3 will 
have a Discontinuation Visit  performed with a  subsequent 30 -day Follow -Up. 
 Subjects who complete Extension Period treatment at Month 12 (Visit 8) will 
have a Follow -Up Visit, 30 days after last dose of study drug (Visit 9).  
Subjects who require anticoagulant treatment after discontinuation of the stu dy treatment at any 
time will be transitioned to a therapy as determined by the Investigator  (Appendix  17.7). 
About 150 subjects from sites selected globally will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio 
(edoxaban :SOC , respectively ) ratio into this  study .  
Subjects from 1 to <18 years of age will be enrolled in the study as soon as the dosing regimen is 
established for each age cohort in the Ph ase 1 single -dose U157 study.  U157 has 5 dosing age 
cohorts  that are similar to the U313 study : 
 Ages 12 to <18 years  
 Ages 6 to <12 years  
 Ages 2 to <6 years

(In Cohort 4 [6 months to <2 years], enrollment may open after the prot ocol data 
requirement for IDMC review for subject s less than 1 year old is met and the IDMC 
reviews and approves the data . Sites will be notified that enrollment of 6 month olds 
to <1 year olds may also open.)   
 Ages birth to <6 months.  
A review of safety data of 10%, 25%, 50% , and 75% of subjects completing the Main T reatment 
Period of 3 months will be performed on a routine basis by the Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee ( IDMC ). In addition, the IDMC will review the edoxaban exposure analysis from the 
U157 study in addition to the safety data from each age cohort to approve the proposed dose for 
the same age cohort in the U313 study . 
Additionally, subjects less than 1 year of age will be admitted to the study after review by the 
IDMC of safety data of 5 0% of subjects in the 1 to <18 years of age group who have completed 
the Main Treatment P eriod of 3 months (50 subjects in edoxaban arm and 25  subjects in SOC 
arm).  
3.3. End of Study  
This study will continue to randomize subjects until approximately 150 subjec ts (100  edoxaban - 
and 50 SOC -treated subjects) complete at least 3 months of treatment.  All subjects in the 
Extension Period  will complete treatment as judged by the Investigator after the last subject is 
randomized and completes 3 months of treatment.  
Primary safety endpoints are achieved during the first  3-month treatment period, ie, safety 
(bleeding) events occur across both treatment groups for the safety analysis set during the first 3 -
month treatment period anytime from the date of first dose of st udy drug through the final Month 
3 Visit in all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of randomized study drug.  Based 
on the End of Randomization date a global End of Treatment (EOT) date will be established that 
ensures a minimum of 3 months o f treatment for the last subject(s) randomized to study.  All 
subjects must permanently discontinue study treatment on or before the EOT date.  A final 
Follow -Up Visit  date will be set 1 month following the EOT date.  All subjects must complete 
their Follow -Up Safety Visit and permanently discontinue study on or before the Follow -Up 
Visit  date.  All subjects that discontinue treatment at Month 3 based on EOT will be placed on 
SOC at Investigator discretion.  All safety and efficacy events will be evaluated by th e CEC.  
Adjudicated results will be the basis for the final analyses.

5.1. Assigning Subjects to Treatments and Blinding  
5.1.1.  Treatment Group s 
All subjects will be assessed for eligibility in the study in accordance with the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Eligible s ubjects will be stratified and randomized as follows:  
 All eligible subjects will be s tratified by:  
Type of u nderlying heart disease : 
 Kawasaki disease  
 Fontan surgery  
 Heart failure (HF)  
 Others (which can include post -surgical procedures for congenital heart disease 
other than Fontan surgery)  
Subjects with underlying disease other than Kawasaki will be further stratified by 
concomitant use of low dose aspirin (1 to 5 mg/kg/ day). 
 Randomized  in a 2:1 ratio (edoxaban:SOC, respectively) into 1 of 2 treatment arms:  
 Edoxaban -treatment arm: subjects will receive a selected dose of edoxaban  
OR 
 SOC -treatment arm: subjects will receive SOC anticoagulant according to clinical 
site’s SOC treatment, as  follows (alone or in combination):  
 Heparin, including UFH or LMWH   
 Vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) with potential bridging with heparin based therapy 
until VKA INR is in therapeutic range  
After Month  3, all subjects who continue in the Extension Period  and are on SOC will be offered 
edoxaban treatment and dosed according to their cohort age at the time of subject consent . 
During the extension period of the study, check the body weight prior to dosing and adjust 
dosage accordingly.  Frequency of dosage ch anging is up to the Investigator’s discretion.  
Subjects from 1 to <18 years of age will be enrolled in the study as soon as the dosing regimen is 
established  for each age cohort in the Phase 1 single -dose U157 study.  
Additionally, subjects less than 1 year  of age will be admitted to the study after review by the 
IDMC of safety data of 50% of subjects in the 1 to <18 years of age group who have completed 
the Main Treatment Period of 3 months (50 subjects in edoxaban ar m and 25  subjects in SOC 
arm).  
Subjects  younger than 6 years of age will only receive edoxaban granules for oral suspension, 
which will give more flexibility to adjust mg/kg dose.  Doses for all age groups will be selected to 
elicit target exposures comparable to those achieved from the adult Ph ase 3 study of 60 mg.

Study treatment should be administered on the same day as randomization (Day 1)  if INR is ≤2.5 
for subjects receiving VKA prior  to randomization . 
5.1.1.1.  Edoxaban -Treatment Arm  (Randomization  through  Month 12 , and All SOC 
Subjects Converted to Edoxaban after Month 3)  
Edoxaban treatment will be packaged and  dispensed to the subject on a monthly visit schedule . 
For subjects who cannot pick up their study therapy on a monthly basis, accommodations will be 
made to allow the Investigator to distribute up to a 3 -month supply of study drug to match the 
scheduled study visit interval.  Edoxaban will be given orally at the appropriate dose depending 
on the results of the ongoin g U157 study .  
Cohort 1 (12 to <18 years old)  and Cohort 2 (6 to <12 years old) will receive tablets (15 and/or 
30 mg strength, see  Table  5.1) or offered granules for oral suspension if swallo wing is an issue.  
Subjects < 2 years of age will take edoxaban granules for oral suspension which will provide 
more flexibility to a djust mg/kg dose . Subjects will be instructed to take  the edoxaban  dose 
orally once a day, at the same time every day, preferably in the morning, with or without food.  
Tablets should be swallowed with a glass of water.  One bottle of edoxaban granules should be 
used for each dosing day.  The recommended dosing for the  12 to <18 , 6 to <12 , and 2 to <6 year 
olds is shown in  Table  5.1. 
Dosing recommendations for the lower age cohorts will be provided as the U157 single -dose 
edoxaban study completes the PK exposure analysis for similar age cohorts.  Doses for all 
subsequent age cohorts will be by separate notification to the investigative sites outside the 
content of this protocol .

Abbreviations: eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; NA = not applicable; QD = once a day  
a Conditions for dose reduction:   
If a subject requires concomitant administration of P -glycoprotein (P -gp) inhibitor (Appendix  17.6.1 ), the 
edoxaban dose will be reduced during P -gp administr ation and re -established to the original dose once P -gp 
inhibitor administration had concluded.  
Edoxaban dosage regimen will be reduced permanently for subjects with moderate renal impairment for the 
subject’s age and size at randomization as determined b y the age appropriate formula: Cockcroft -Gault 
equation for pediatric subjects ≥12 years of age and modified Schwartz eq uation for pediatric subjects <12 
years of age).  Refer to Appendix  17.9 for eGFR values below which dose reduction should be implemented.   
If a subject experiences a change in renal function from normal to eGFR ≥30% to ≤50% after 
randomization, the measurement will be repeated within 1 week.  If the repeat measurement confirms the 
decrease, the edoxaban dose reduction will be permanent  even if the subject experiences an improvement 
in the eGFR during the course of the study.  
b Dose reduction due to body weight applies only for fixed doses in subjects 12 to <18 years of age :  
If body weight increases or decreases from the categories of weight defined at consent, the subject will be dose 
adjusted.  Subjects  who are  ≥60 kg of body we ight at consent and drop  below that body weight will receive 45 
mg dose at any subsequent visit.  Subjects ≥30 and <60 kg at consent increasing their weight to ≥60 kg will 
increase their dose to 60 mg.  
c Edoxaban dosage regimen will be reduced permanently f or subject with body weight <5th percentile for age.  Refer 
to Appendix  17.11 . 
d Per Principal Investigator’s discretion, for subjects in Cohort 2 that require either 45  mg or 60  mg dose, the 
Principal Investigator may use edoxaban tablets instead of granules, if they wish.   
e Edoxaban granu lation will be diluted with 8 m L water to provide a concentration of 6 mg/ mL dosing suspension.   
If body weight  increases or decreases from the categories of weight defined at consent, the subject will be dose 
adjusted.  Subjects  who are  ≥60 kg of body weight at consent and drop  below that body weight will receive 45 
mg dose at any subsequent visit . Subjects ≥30 and  <60 kg at consent increasing their weight to ≥60 kg will 
increase their dose to 60 mg.  
Note: Dose is based upon weight at corresponding visit . 
For subjects without prior anticoagulant therapy, edoxaban may be started the day of 
randomization (Day 1).

edoxaban , VKA treatment  will be discontinued  the day before  randomization and edoxaban dose 
will be initiated when an INR ≤2.5 is reached.  
5.1.1.2.  Standard of Care Treatment Arm  (Ran domization to Month 3) . 
SOC randomized subjects will be treated with SOC though Month 3 (Visit 5) and then offered 
edoxaban through Month 12 . SOC treatment will be packaged and dispensed to the subject on a 
monthly visit schedule . After Month 3, all subjec ts will be transitioned to edoxaban at the 
appropriate dose for their age and weight.  Locally sourced SOC is the preferred option for this  
study , either by the Investigator  or, alternatively local supply depots within each country that 
provide SOC directly to the clinical sites . However, centrally sourced SOC can be provided 
when the country or clinical site requirements deem it necessary.  In the case of centrally sourced 
treatment, the Sponsor will only provide enoxaparin as LMWH and w arfarin as VKA.   
For subjects who did  not receive VKA treatment prior to randomization and are randomized to 
SOC with VKA, VKA treatment may be started on the day of randomization  (Day 1) .  
It is the Investigator ’s discretion based on his/her local practic e and on the subject’s underlying 
cardiac disease to consider if heparin bridging is necessary  when initiating VKA post 
randomization until an INR between 2.0 and 3.0 is reached.  Heparin br idging will be provided by 
the Investigator.  
5.1.2.  Method of Treatment Al location  
Eligible subjects will be stratified as mentioned in Section  5.1.1 . An independent biostatistician 
will generate the randomization schedule in accordance with the operating procedure for 
allocating study drug.   
At randomization, the Investigator  provides the Interactive Web/Voice Response System  (IXRS ) 
with the clinical site  number and  the subject’s presenting diagnosis and date of birth.  
Dose will be reduced for subjects based on the following criteria:  
 eGFR is 30 -50% of norm al for age and size ( Appendix  17.9 ). If a subject experiences  
a change in renal function from normal to eGFR ≥30% to ≤50% after randomization, 
the measurement will be repeated within 1 week . If the repeat measurement confirms 
the eGFR ≥30% to ≤50% , the edoxaban dose will be reduced permanently.  
 Subject is receiving concomitant treatment w ith P-gp inhibitors . The dose will be 
reduced while on P -gp inhibitor and re -established to original dose once the 
concomitant medication is stopped  (Appendix  17.6.1 ). 
 Body Weight:  
 For subjects 12 to <18 year s old   with b ody weight <5th percentile of subject’s 
age (see Appendix  17.11 ), edoxaban doses will be permanently changed . 
 For subjects 12 to <18 year s old  with b ody weight  ≥60 kg,  will receive 
edoxaban 60  mg. However, if the body weight is ≥30 - <60 kg, edoxaban dose 
would be 45  mg daily. If the patient body weight ≥60 kg, then edoxaban dose 
would be escalated to 60  mg daily.

5.2. Study Drug (s) 
5.2.1.  Description  
The study drug  for this study is edoxaban (DU -176b) and SOC anticoagulants ( UFH/LMWH  and 
VKA).  The active ingredient is edoxaban tosylate and the international non -proprietary n ame is 
N-(5-Chloropyridin -2-yl)-N’-[(1S,2R,4S) -4-(N,N -dimethylcarbamoyl) -2-(5-methyl -4,5,6,7 -
tetrahydro[1,3]thiazolo[5,4 -c]pyridine -2-carboxamido)cyclohexyl] oxamide mono (4 -
methylbenzenesulfonate) monohydrate . 
5.2.1.1.  Edoxaban  (Randomization t hrough Month 12)  
Edoxaban will be packaged and supplied to the su bject on a monthly visit schedule as tablets (15 
and/or 30 mg strength) or granules for oral suspension (60 mg  strength)  even though after Month 
3 the clinic visitation schedule is every 3 months.  For subjects who cannot pick up their study 
therapy o n a monthly basis, accommodations will be made to allow the Investigator to distribute 
up to a 3 -month supply of study drug to match the scheduled study visit interval.  
Subjects will be instructed to take edoxaban (tablets or granules) orally once a day, a t the same 
time every day,  preferably in the morning,  with or without food.  One bottle of edoxaban granules 
will be used for each dosing day.  Tablets should be swallowed with a glass of water.   
The doses will be dispensed as follows:  
For subjects 12 to <18  years old:  
 A 60 mg dose will be dispensed as two 30 mg tablets  or 10 mL from an individual 
bottle of oral suspension 60 mg  
 A 45 mg dose will be dispensed as one 30 mg tablet plus one 15 mg tablet  or 7.5 mL 
from an individual bottle of oral suspension 60 m g

Page 58  A 30 mg dose will be dispensed as one 30 mg tablet  or 5 mL  from an individual bottle 
of oral suspension 60 mg   
 Dose s provide d by the granulation formulation will be dispensed with a dosing 
syringe according to the recommended dose shown in Table  5.1. 
 If a subject does not have the capacity to swallow tablets in the 12 to <18 year and 6 
to <12 year old group s, the tablets may be crushed an d served with applesauce or 
mixed with 2 to 3 ounces of water and immediately administered by mouth or through 
an existing  gastric tube , if needed . 
For subjects 6 to <12 years old : 
 60 mg dose will be dispensed as two 30 mg tablets or as 10 mL from an indiv idual 
bottle of oral suspension 60 mg.  
 45 mg dose will be dispensed as one 30 mg tablet plus one 15 mg tablet or as 7.5 mL 
from an individual bottle of oral suspension 60 mg.  
 Dose other than 45mg and 60mg provided by the granulation formulation will be 
dispensed with a dosing syringe according to the recommended dose shown in 
Table  5.1. One bottle will be used for each daily dose . 
5.2.1.2.  Standard of Care  (Randomization through Month 3)  
Treatment with SOC will only occur through Month 3.  After th at time all subjects will be offered  
edoxaban at a dose appropriate for age and weight.  Local sourcing will be the preferred  option 
for SOC drugs, either by the Investigator  or local depot providing locally utilized therapy to treat 
TE. The S ponsor will supply central sourcing as an alternative option to local SOC sourcing .  
Clinical supply will be  packaged and dispensed to the subject on a monthly visit schedule .  
If local sourcing is used, the Investigator  is allowed to utilize any UFH  or LMWH, and/or VKA  
according to the  SOC treatment  specific to that clinical site (no strength restrictions).  
If central sourcing i s used , only enoxaparin and wa rfarin will be suppl ied by the S ponsor at fixed 
doses as the LMWH and the VKA, respectively.  If a subject is prescribed a dose of the LMWH 
or VKA different from the doses supplied, a combination of the various doses should be used to 
obtain the desired dose.  Guidance on dosing and dispensing is provided in Appendix  17.2. 
Note: If standard practice for bridging VKA to therapeutic levels is achieved with a  heparin 
(UFH or LMWH ) based treatment, the clinical  site will be responsible for providing the bridging 
therapy for subjects randomized to VKA.  
If required, t he Spons or will provide centrally sourced SOC treatment at the following fixed 
doses:  
 Enoxaparin (LMWH) will be provided as solution for SC injection in pre -filled 
syringes with only 60 mg/0.6  mL, 80 mg/0.8 mL , and 100 mg/1.0 mL  concentration  
for injection , or as multiple dose vials (for subjects <20 kg) .  
 Warfarin (VKA) will be supplied as tablets (0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 3  mg). Various doses 
will be available for INR maintenanc e in the therapeutic range of 2 to 3.

Clinical s ites or treating p hysicians will provide aspirin  (as per local SOC  practice ). 
5.2.2.  Labeling and Packaging  
5.2.2.1.  Edoxaban  
Study drug will be provided in adequate quantity for study conduct and labeled in an open -label 
format.  Study drug labels will include all information required by federal and local regulations.  
Edoxaban 15  and 30 mg tablets wi ll be supplied by the Sponsor in an open -label format.  The 
edoxaban  60 mg  granules for oral suspension will be provided in glass bottles, as per visit 
schedule, for single dose administration . 
5.2.2.2.  Standard of Care  
Standard of care  sourced locally either by th e Investigator  or by a local depot providing SOC to 
the clinical site will have no modification in labeling or packaging . Hence,  local ly sourced SOC 
treatment  will have a label identical to  the procured drug.  
If required, centrally sourced SOC treatment will be presented in its commercial presentation 
with the clinical study over -label.  SOC labels will include all information required by federal and 
local regulations.  
Note: If standard practice for bridging VKA to therapeutic levels is achieved with a hep arin 
based treatment, the clinical  site will be responsible for providing the bridging therapy if the 
subject is randomized to VKA.  
5.2.3.  Preparation  
5.2.3.1.  Edoxaban  
No special preparation will be required for the tablet formulation.  However, i f a subject does not 
have the capacity to swallow tablets in the 12  to <18 year old group, the tablets may be crushed 
and served with applesauce or mixed with 2 to 3 ounces of water and immediately administered 
by mouth or through a n existing  gastric  tube, if needed . 
The edoxaban  granules for oral suspension 60 mg will be provided in amber glass bottles (wide 
neck) with child -resistant  caps.  The edoxaban granules for oral suspension 60 mg formulation 
will be reconstituted with 8 mL of water  to provide a 6 mg/mL liquid suspension . One bottle will 
be used for each daily dose.  Instructions for reconstitution will be provided to the 
Investigator /designee  and the caregiver .

Page 60 5.2.4.  Administration  
Study drug will be packaged and  dispensed  to the subject on a monthly visit schedule.  For 
subjects who cannot pick up their study therapy on a monthly basis, accommoda tions will be 
made to allow the Investigator to distribute up to a 3 -month edoxaban supply of study drug (for 
those continuing after Month 3  through Month 12) to match the scheduled study visit interval.  
Note that each monthly dispensing visit is not indic ated in Table  17.1 because no additional 
procedures are expected at the monthly dispens ing visits . 
Locally  sourced study drug will be provided by the In vestigator or through a depot within the 
country of the clinical  site. If required, c entrally sourced  study drug will be shipped to the 
clinical sites, and the Investigator /designee will be responsible for dispensing the study drugs.  
The Investigator /desig nee will provide the subjects with product in sufficient quantity, plus 
overage, via IXRS dispensing until the next scheduled visit.   
The Investigator /designee will also instruct the subject on reporting study drug or SOC 
administration and accountability.  Subjects who miss 1 dose of study drug or SOC will be 
instructed to skip that dose and take the next dose at their drug administration schedule.  
5.2.4.1.  To Initiate Edoxaban Treatment  at Randomization  
For subjects without prior anticoagulant therapy, edoxaban may be started the day of 
randomization (Day 1).   
For subjects who received VKA treatment prior to randomization and are randomized to 
edoxaban, VKA treatment will be discontinued the day before  randomization and edoxaban dose 
will be initiated when an INR ≤2.5 is reached.  It is per Investigator ’s discretion based on his/her 
local practice and on the subject’s underlying cardiac disease to consider if heparin bridging is 
necessary during this period.  Heparin br idging will be provided by the I nvestigator.  
If heparin bridging is used, edoxaban will be started as below:   
1. In case of bridging with a LMWH twice a day  regimen , edoxaban dosing  will start  
12 ± 3 hours after the last LMWH dose  
2. In case of bridging with a  LMWH once a day regimen , edoxaban dosing  will star t 
24 ± 3 hours after the last LMWH  
3. In case of bridging with a UFH regimen , edoxaban dosing  will start 4 ± 1 hour after the 
last UFH dose  
5.2.4.2   Transition SOC -Treat ed Subjects during the Main Treatment Period  to 
Edoxab an in the Extension Period   
For subjects who received VKA treatment edoxaban dosing will be initiated when an INR ≤2.5 is 
reached.  This may occur  as early as n ext day of the Extension Period .  
If the subject was originally randomized to UFH or LMWH, edoxaban will be started as below:   
1. In case of LMWH twice a day  regimen , edoxaban dosing  will start  12 ± 3 hours after the 
last LMWH dose

last LMWH  
3. In case of UFH regimen , edoxaban dosing  will start 4 ± 1  hour after the last UFH dose  
5.2.4.3   To Initiate SOC Treatment  
If the s ubject  is randomized to  the SOC treatment and they use locally sourced SOC, they  will 
receive the following SOC anticoagulant  treatment  according to the clinical  site’s usual treatment 
practice  (alone or in combination):  
 LMWH (alone or with  VKA)  
 UFH (alone or with VKA)  
 VKA  (alone or with LMWH or UFH ) 
For subjects who do not receive VKA treatment prior to randomization and are randomized to 
SOC with VKA, VKA treatment may be started on the day of randomization  (Day 1) .  
It is per Investigator ’s discretion based on his/her local practice and on the subject’s underlying 
cardiac disease to consider if heparin bridging is necessary post-randomization  until an INR 
between 2.0 a nd 3.0 is reached.  Heparin br idging will be provided by the I nvestigator.  
If centrally sourced SOC treatment is required from the Sponsor,  the subject will be treated as 
follows:  
 For subjects randomized to enoxaparin: Neonates or children receiving either once - or 
twice -daily therapeutic enoxaparin should be monitored as per local practice.   
 For su bjects randomized to warfarin , it is recommended that  the dose should be 
titrated to achieve a target INR of  2.0 to 3.0. It is per Investigator ’s discretion based 
on his/her local practice and on the subject’s underlying cardiac disease to consider if 
heparin bridging is n ecessary during this period.  Visits will be at the discretion of the 
Investigator  and captured as unschedule d visits for data collection.  Adjustment of the 
maintenance dose of VKA will be dependent on INR monitoring as follows:  
 INR  2.0 to 3.0, no change in dose  
 INR  1.1 to 1.4, increase dose by 20%  
 INR  1.5 to 1.9, increase dose by 10%  
 INR  3.1 to 3.5, dec rease dose by 10%  
 INR >3.5, hold VKA until INR is <3.5, then decrease dose by 20% when 
restarted.  
To initiate SOC post screening, it is recommended to test infants and children every 4 weeks 
once a stable dose of VKA has been achieved.  However, depending on the site’s clinical practice 
and PI’s discretion, the subjects can be tested at the physician’s discretion and/or according to 
local practice . More frequent INR testing is recommended in infants and children receiving VKA 
with any change in diet or medi cation or when an illness occurs.  An unscheduled visit will need

Version 4 .0, 03 JUN  2019  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 62 to be performed to document the discretionary INR measurement and potential VKA dosage 
change as an unscheduled visit day.  
For subjects on LMWH or UFH, periodic assessment of therapeutic level is recommended . The 
most w idely used laboratory assay for monitoring  UFH  or LMWH therapy is the aPTT  and anti-
FXa activity.  All testing for therapeutic monitoring after randomization will be conducted 
locally . 
Guidance on dosing and dispensing is pro vided in Appendix  17.2. 
5.2.5.  Storage  
Edoxaban tablets and granules for oral suspension must  be stored at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) 
with excursions permit ted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F).  
SOC treatments must be stored as per labeled storage conditions.  
All drug supplies must be stored in a secure, limited access storage area under the recommended 
storage conditions.  If storage conditions go outside of allowable excursions, Sponsor/ Contract 
Research Organization ( CRO ) must be contacted.  The excursions will be discussed with the 
Sponsor and CRO to determine what action is necessary.  
Storage temperatures must be recorded using devices such as a maximum/mi nimum 
thermometer.  Temperature measurements will be recorded on a temperature log excluding 
weekends and holidays.  
5.2.6.  Drug Accountability  
5.2.6.1.  Edoxaban  
Edoxaban will be provided by the S ponsor . When a drug shipment is received, the Investigator  
or designee will confirm  the amount and condition of the drug and confirm the  appropriate local 
language in the label, drug expiration date, and temperature monitor readings.  The Investigator  
or designee will also sign the Receipt of Shipment Form provide d and the form should be 
returned as instructed on the form.  The original form will be retained at the clinical site . In 
addition, the Investigator  or designee shall contact the Sponsor as soon as possible if there is a 
problem with the shipment and quaran tine the shipment until the resolution is obtained from the 
Sponsor.  
At the end of the study, or as directed, all drug products, including unused, partially used, or 
empty containers, will be destroyed, after full accountability.  If drug destruction occurs  at the 
clinical site , this must be approved in writing by the Sponsor and the Sponsor has received 
copies of the clinical site ’s drug handling and disposition standard operating procedures (SOPs).  
For Sponsor provided drug, dosage form (ie, tablet s and  granule bottles) clinical site level 
accountability documentation is required as part of the disposition records of study drug . The 
dosage form site level accountability documentation should be appended to the Certificate of 
Destruction , if available . 
The study drug will only be returned to a designee as instructed by the Sponsor if the clinical site  
is unable to perform the products destruction.  Study drug will be returned only after the study 
monitor has completed a final inventory to verify the quant ity to be returned.  The

reconciliation statement must be completed by the Investigator /designee and provided to the 
Sponsor.  
Dosage form (ie, tablet s and  granule b ottles) clinical site level accountability documentation is to 
be included with each drug supply return shipment (or other returning facility, such as another 
depot).  This is required as part of the receiving records for return shipments.  
All inventory for ms must be made available for inspection by a Sponsor -authorized 
representative or designee and regulatory agency inspectors.  The Investigator  is responsible for 
the accountability of all used and unused study supplies at the clinical site . 
5.2.6.2.  Standard of Car e 
For both locally sourced SOC and Sponsor -provided SOC,  a Drug Accountability Record will be 
used for the products.  It may either be provided by the Sponsor or Sponsor representative,  or the 
site may use a Sponsor a pproved  form. The record must be kept cu rrent and must contain the 
dates and quantities of drug received from the central  or local  supply (for Sponsor provided 
therapy), subjects for whom the products was dispensed (identification number and/or initials or 
supply number as applicable), the date and quantity of study drug  dispensed and remaining, if 
from individual subject drug units, as well as the initials of the dispenser.  All unused drug and 
containers whether provided by the S ponsor or provided locally , must be brought back to the 
clinical site for accountability to support appropriate dosing instructions to the subject.  
At the end of the study, or as directed, all drug products, including unused, partially used, or 
empty containers, will be destroyed, after full accountability.  If drug destru ction occurs at the 
clinical site , this must be approved in writing by the Sponsor and the Sponsor has received 
copies of the clinical site ’s drug handling and disposition SOPs).  Locally sourced SOC should be 
destroyed at the clinical site . 
For Sponsor -provided and locally supplied drug, dosage form (ie, tablet s and syringes) site level 
accountability documentation is required as part of the disposition records of study drug . The 
dosage form site level accountability documentation should be appended to t he Certificate of 
Destruction , if available . 
The study drug will only be returned to a designee as instructed by the Sponsor if the clinical site  
is unable to perform the products destruction.  Study drug  will be returned only after the study 
monitor has co mpleted a final inventory to verify the quantity to be returned.  The 
return/destruction of products must be documented.  At the end of the study, a final product 
reconciliation statement must be completed by the Investigator /designee and provided to the 
Sponsor.  
Dosage form (ie, tablet, granule bottles, and syringes) site level accountability documentation is 
to be included with each drug supply return shipment (or other returning facility, such as another 
depot).  This is required as part of the receiving r ecords for return shipments.  
All inventory forms must be made available for inspection by a Sponsor -authorized 
representative or designee and regulatory agency inspectors.  The Investigator  is responsible for 
the accountability of all used and unused study supplies at the clinical site .

Page 64 5.3. Dose Interr uptions and Reductions  
If a subject’s treatment with study drug must be interrupted for medical or surgical reasons (eg, 
hospital admission for an invasive procedure, a major medical condition, surgery, 
thrombocyto penia due to cytoto xic medication, or dental work);  use of a prohibited concomitant 
medication; or other reasons (eg, temporary situation that prevents subject adherence with the 
study drug administration schedule, etc), the subject’s study drug should be resumed as early as 
the situation allows.  Edoxaban should be discontinued for 24 hours prior to the initiation of the 
procedures.  
Subjects should be encouraged to restart study drug after an interruption except when absolutely 
contraindicated.  The duratio n of study drug interruption can vary depending upon the individual 
circumstances, and study drug may be resumed regardless of the duration of time that it had been 
interrupted.  Any subject who temporarily interrupts study drug more than 3 days will have t he 
reason recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
Any study drug interruption due to an adverse event should be reported on the Adverse Event  
eCRF, even if it is less than 3 days. A patient may have multiple interruptions of treatment 
throughout their study participation . 
5.3.1.  Edoxaban Dose Reduction  
During the treatment period, a subject may reduce the dose of edoxaban f or any of the following 
reasons:  
 eGFR is 30 -50% of normal for age and size  (permanent dose reduction ) 
(Appendix  17.9) 
 NOTE: If the repeat measurement confirms the decrease, the edoxaban dose will 
be reduced permanently.  This dose reduction will be permanent even if the 
subject experiences an improvement in the eGFR during the course of the study.  
 Subject is receiving concomitant treatment with P -gp inhibitors  (temporary dose 
reduction)  
 Body Weight:  
 For subjects 12 to <18 year s old   with b ody weight <5th percentile of subject’s 
age (see Appendix  17.11 ), edoxaban doses will be permanently changed . 
 For subjects 12 to <18 year s old  with b ody weight  ≥60 kg,  will receive 
edoxaban 60 mg.  However, if the body weight is ≥30 - <60 kg, edoxaban dose 
would be 45 mg daily. If the patient body weight ≥60 kg, then edoxaban dose 
would be escalated to 60 mg daily . 
 For subjects <12 year s old: Doses will be provided  by mg/kg  or a dose may be 
suggested, subsequent to exposure modeling, based on an age range  (see 
Table  5.1). 
For subjects receiving P -gp inhibitors  during the study treatment period , the dose of edoxaban 
will only be reduced during the administration of the concomitant  P-gp inhibitor.  Subjects 
Protocol  DU176b -C-U313  
Version 4 .0, 03 JUN  2019  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 65 experiencing eGFR or body weight reduction will maintain their reduced edoxaban dose for the 
duration of the study.  
5.4. Method of Assessing Treatment Compliance  
Dosing compliance for subjects in the edoxaban treatment arm  will be assessed by means of 
tablet/bottl e counts remaining and/or drug packaging/ bottles returned.  All drug packaging will be 
returned at each subject visit and will be accountable including bottles with dilutions made for 
dosing.  Administration of the study drug will be recorded in the case rep ort form 
(CRF )/eCRF/Drug Accountability Record.  As necessary, include method of compliance 
calculation based on the returned number of tablets/bottles.  If zero tablets/bottles returned, ask 
subject whether any were disposed or thrown away, rather than take n orally.  
Subjects in the SOC (VKA) treatment arm will be monitored for compliance by measuring INR 
levels.  Subjects in the SOC ( UFH, LMWH ) treatment arm will be monitored for compliance by 
measuring anti -FXa levels  or aPTT . Compliance should be assessed r outinely by the Investigator  
to ensure the adequate doses are taken ( Table  17.1). Monitoring of heparin based treatment or 
VKA will be performed locally.  
5.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications that the subject has taken within 30 days before screening will be reco rded.  In 
additio n, anticoagulant and anti platelet therapy will be recorded up to 3 months prior to 
randomization.  
The following drugs and devices (see Appendix  17.5) CANNOT be used during the entire study 
treatment period and their unavoidable use would require study drug therapy interruption unless 
specifically indicated for study drug discontinuation:  
 Anticoagulants, other than the assigned study dr ugs, by any route  study drug should 
be discontinu ed 
 Single or dual antiplatelet therapy with any antiplatelet agent is prohibited except for 
low dose aspirin defined as  1 to 5 mg/k g/day with maximum of 100  mg/day . If a 
clinical indication for antiplatelet therapy (other than low dose aspirin) arises after 
randomization, study drug should be temporarily interrupted and use of any other 
anticoagulation therapy is permitted at the physician’s discretion.  
 Chronic use o f oral or parenteral non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) 
including both cyclooxygen ase-1 and cyclooxygenase -2 inhibitors other than aspirin 
for ≥4 days/week . Use of NSAIDs via other routes (eg, topical, inhaled, intranasal, 
intraocular, etc) are  not restricted (see Appendix  17.5.5 ). 
All P -gp inhibitors (please refer to Appendix  17.6.1  for a list of  the most commonly used P -gp 
inhibitors) excluding amiodarone will require dose reduction  of edoxaban.  
The Investigator  is encouraged to contact a study physician (telephone number will be pr ovided 
per country, per region; please refer to Study Manual for an appropriate phone number) if further 
guidance is needed.

name, dose , and dosing regimen for  population PK analyses  at Month 1 . 
5.6. Subject Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
Any subject who discontinues from the study treatmen t for any reason will have his or her  study 
treatment discontinuation recorded.  
A subject may discontinue study treatment d uring the  Main Treatment Period;  however the 
subject should still remain as a study participant for scheduled visits through Month 3 (Visit 5) . 
The subject  should complete  the subsequent 30 -day Follow -Up Visit  (Visit 9) regardless of 
whether  they stop all anticoagu lant therapy or are placed on a treatment that they were  not 
assigned to at randomization.  
If a subject discontinues from treatment after Month 3  he/she  will be discontinued from the study 
and should still receive  a Discontinuation Visit  and a 30-day Follow-Up Visit . 
5.6.1.  Discontinuation from Treatment  within the Main Treatment Period (Month 3)  
Early discontinuation of study drug is discouraged.  However if, in the Investigator ’s opinion, 
continuation of study drug would be detrimental to the subject’s well-being or in specific clinical 
situations (eg, liver function test  [LFT]  disturbances, severe renal insufficiency, TE, bleeding), 
the study drug can be stopped permanently.   
Subjects who discontinue treatment  during the Main Treatment Period should ret urn to the 
clinical site per the study procedure schedule ( Table  17.1) for all remaining  safety and efficacy 
assessments through the Month 3 visit (Vis it 5) regardless of what treatment, if any, they ma y 
subsequently be taking.  A 30 -day Follow -Up Visit  (Visit 9) will be required . A telephone call for 
Follow -Up assessment may be conducted in exceptional circumstances when the subject is not 
able or willing to present to the clinical site .  
The reasons for discontinuation from treatment must be documented.  
If a subject discontinues treatment prior to Month 3, the Investigator  will complete and report the 
observations as thoroughly as possible at scheduled visits including the date of last treatment and 
the reason for discontinuation from  study treatment though 3 months of observation .  
5.6.2.  Discontinuation from Treatment and Study  beyond Month 3 up to Month 12  
During the Extension Period  (beyond 3 months treatment), all subjects who disc ontinue from the 
study treatment  will also discontinue from the study and  will return to the clinical s ite for a 
Discontinuation Visit  (Visit 8) and a 30 -day Follow -Up Visit  (Visit 9) after the Discontinuation 
Visit .  
Note: Subjects in the Extension Period  do not need to be followed through 12 months  of study 
procedures and can discontinue from treatment and study per Investigator  discretion at any time 
with a Discontinuation Visit  after Month 3  and a 30-day Follow -Up Visit  after the 
Discontinuation Visit .  
5.6.3.  Reasons for Discontinuation from  Study Treatment  
Subjects may discontinu e the treatment  for any of the following reasons :

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 67 1. End of requirement for anticoagulant therapy  
2. Reasons related to adverse events (AEs):  
 If initiating or continuing study drug places the subject at undue hazard as determined 
by the Investigator ; 
 If the subj ect had a serious adverse event ( SAE ) or other safety concern that is related 
to study drug treatment as determined by the Investigator ; 
 If the subject had a m ajor bleeding event as determined by the Investigator ; 
 If the subject has an a ggravation or new o ccurrence of renal insufficiency with 
estimated eGFR <30% of normal for age and size (Cockcroft -Gault equation for 
pediatric subjects ≥12 years of age and modified Schwartz equation for pediatric 
subjects <12 years of age) ; 
 If the subject demonstrates h epatic test abnormalities including : 
 Elevation of alanine transaminase ( ALT ) and/or aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ≥3 
× ULN and TBL ≥2 × ULN simultaneously.  
 ALT and/or AST ≥8 × ULN requires an immediate interruption of study drug 
treatment and prompt repeat testing to confirm abnormality.  
 If the subject demonstrates c linical jaundice  that requires an immediate interruption 
of study drug treatment and prompt repeat testing to confirm abnormality;  
 If the subject has a ny elevation of transaminases combined with  clinical symptoms of 
liver injury;  
 If a subject discontinues study drug due to confirmed liver e nzyme abnormalities or 
jaundice . The subject will have additional evaluations at the discretion of the 
Investigator  as follows:  
 Hepatitis A, B, C, and E screen ing (anti -HAV IgM, HBsAg, anti -HCV plus viral 
titer, and evaluation for Hep E);  
 Abdominal ultrasound;  
 Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti -SmAb;  
 Cytomegalovirus (CMV);  
 Epstein -Barr virus (EBV);  
 Additional evaluations as deemed appropriate by the Investigator  to exclude other 
causes of liver enzyme and TBL  elevations.  
Subjec t’s follow -up will be required on a weekly basis until the values (transaminases and TBL) 
return to a clinically acceptable level.  For the above laboratory blood tests, using the central 
laboratory is recommended.  However, if circumstances warrant the use of a local laboratory, 
copies of the local laboratory results will be required.  All clinically significant hepatic enzyme 
abnormalities and/or hepatic events are  to be documen ted in the eCRF with prompt submission 
of the adjudication dossier for events that led to study drug discontinuation or were reported as

to study drug cannot be r uled out . 
3. Unplanned cardiac surgery due to aggravation of cardiac conditions;  
4. Pregnancy;  
5. Study terminated by Sponsor;  
6. Protocol violation;  
7. Lack of efficacy.  
Those subjects  whose participation  extended beyond Month 3 (Visit 5) will have study 
procedures term inated at the time of discontinuation from treatment and study with a 
Discontinuation Visit  (Section  6.5.3 ).  
If the subject discontinued study treatment due to an AE, the Investigator  will follow the subject 
until the AE has  been clinically stabilized.  
5.6.4.  Reasons for Withdrawal at any Time during the Study  
Withdrawal of a subject will only occur, by definition, if n o additional protocol scheduled visit 
or Follow -Up Visit  is possible.  The definition of  withdrawal is appropriate for those cases that 
occur in the Main Treatment Period because of the requirement to continue subjects on 
scheduled visits even if they disco ntinue trea tment prior to Month 3 (Visit 5 ). If a subject 
withdraws after Month 3 this would be classified as a discontinuation from treatment and study.   
Any subject who is withdrawn from the study treatment for any reason will have their reasons for 
withdrawal records.   
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study after signing the informed consent form  (ICF)  during 
the Main Treatment Period for the following reasons : 
 Withdrawal of subject consent by subject or legal guardian(s)  
 Death  
 Lost to follow -up (attem pts should be made to not have any subject lost to follow -up) 
 AE that occurs during the Main Treatment Period that requires withdrawal.  
5.6.5.  Withdrawal Procedures  
If a subject is withdrawn  from the study, the Investigator  will complete and report the 
observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal including the date of last 
treatment and the reason for withdrawal.  Subjects  who withdraw from the study  during the 3 
month Main Treatment Period  will also ha ve a 3 month Follow -Up phone call to ascertain any 
events (TE and/or bleeding events) that may have occurred since withdrawal.  The timeframe for 
the 3 -month Follow -Up phone call assessment is from the date of subject randomization .

Page 69 5.6.6.  Procedures  for Discontin uation from Treatment or Study ; or Withdrawal from 
Study  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and other applicable regulations, a subject has the 
right to discontinue study treatment or withdraw consent for participation in the study at any time 
and for any reason without prejudice to his or her future medical care by the physician or at the 
institution.  
While subjects are encouraged to complete all study evaluations, they may discontinue study 
treatment , discontinue from study,  or withdraw from t he study at any time and for any reason 
without penalty.  Every effort will be made to determine why any subject discontinues study 
treatment , or study,  or withdraws from the study prematurely.  This information should be 
recorded.   
The most likely reasons f or withdrawal are death, lost to follow -up or withdrawal of consent, or 
an AE in which case all subsequent visits will NOT be possible as stated in the protocol.  
All subjects who classify as discontinue from the study treatment or study with an ongoing AE  
must be followed until the event is deemed resolved or clinically stable  even if they are not 
willing to participate in the study any longer.  If a subject discontinues study or withdraws after 
dosing, all data normally collected prior to study discharge s hould be collected at the time of 
discontinuation from study or withdrawal, or at the scheduled visit of the study.  
In case of withdrawal, a genuine effort must be made to determine the reason(s) why a subject 
fails to return for the necessary visits . If the subject is unreachable by telephone, a registered 
letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the subject requesting him/her to contact the clinical 
site. 
If a subject is withdrawn or discontinued from study treatment  or study , the IXRS will be called  
by the clinical site  to register the s ubject status.  
Please see suggested classification of discontinuation and withdrawal status in  Table  5.2.

Page 70 5.6.7.  Follow -Up Procedures.  
Subjects who complete the Main Treatment Period (Month 3) but do not continue into the 
Extension Period , will have a their Month 3  Visit and a Follow -Up Visit  30 days after last dose 
of study drug  and discontinued from the study . Follow -Up Visit s may be co nducted by phone, 
however , if the subject experienced an adverse event of concern (Serious) or an endpoint event 
since their Discontinuation Visit , an office visit is highly recommended.  
Subjects who discontinue treatment from the Main Treatment Period pri or to Month 3 will 
continue to be followed monthly according to the Schedule of Events ( Appendix  17.1) through 
the Month 3 visit (Visit 5), and have a 30-day Follow -Up Visit . If treatment discontinuation 
occurs prior to Month 2 visit, the 30 -day Follow -Up Visit  will occur on the same day as the 
Month 3 visit.   
Subjects who extend toward 12 months of study treatment and decide to no longer participate 
will have a subsequent 30 -day Follow -Up Visit  after their Discontinuation Visit . 
5.6.7.1.  Temporary Interruption of Study Drug  
If a subject’s treatment with study drug must be interrupted for medical or surgical reasons (eg, 
hospital admission for an invasive procedure, a major medical condition, surgery, 
thrombocytopenia due to cytotoxic medication, or dental work); use of a prohibited concomitant 
medication; or other reasons (eg, temporary situation that prevents subject adherence with the 
study dr ug administ ration schedule, etc ), the subject’s study drug should be resumed as early as 
the situation allows.  Edoxaban should be discontinued for 24 hours prior to the initiation of the 
procedures (depending on PK/PD data in children).  Subjects should be encouraged to restart 
study drug after an interruption except when absolutely contraindicated.  The duration of study 
drug interruption can vary depending upon the individual circumstances, and study drug may be 
resumed regardless of the duration of time that it had b een interrupted.  Any subject who 
temporarily interrupts study drug will have the reason recorded in the eCRF.  
5.6.8.  Subject Re -screening Procedures  
Re-screening  (retesting of laboratory test results) is permitted only once for any subject with 
Sponsor approval who failed to meet eligibility criteria upon initial screening  related to a specific 
inclusion/exclusion criteria . If a subject needs to be rescreened for any partic ular time -dependent 
module (ie,  laboratory, vital signs , etc.) the I nvestigator will perform  an unscheduled visit within 
30 days of the original screening visit  and the appropriate module will be used to accommodate 
new data that would make the subject eligible to be randomized . The subject  identification 
number will remain the same at the time o f re-screening.  The initial screening information and 
the reason why the subject is ineligible for the initial evaluation will be uploaded into the 
electronic data capture  (EDC)  system .  
Re-screenin g (re-testing of laboratory results)  of a subject may occur only once . If there is a 
failure to meet study entry criteria  the failed subject will be recorded in the Screening Log  and 
EDC .

Page 71 6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Potential subjects will have the study risks and possible benefits explained, the ICF reviewed, 
and all questions answered for them.  Subjects will undergo procedures specific to study 
qualification ( Section  6.2) only after the ICF is signed by the subj ect/or the subject’s legal 
representative, and age appropriate assent obtained from subjects capable of doing so.  Subjects 
who complete the screening period and are determined to be eligible for study participation per 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either the edoxaban -
treatment arm or the SOC -treatment arm , respectively,  for the first 3 months of the study, after 
which all subjects will be offered edoxaban at the appropriate dose for age and weight  at the time 
of informed consent   
All subjects will undergo evaluation for safety  and efficacy evaluations at the EOT  at Month 3 
with a  30-day Follow -Up. Subjects who discontinue treatment prior to Month 3 will continue 
with the scheduled visits up to Month 3 with the 30 -day Follow -Up. Subjects who participate in 
the Extension Period  will undergo safety and efficacy endpoint  evaluations (bleeding events, TE, 
or any other AEs) at Months 6, 9, and 12, and 30 -days after cessation of treatment if treatment up 
to 12 months is required.  If treatment discontinuation occurs prior to Month 2 visit, t he 30 -day 
Follow -Up Visit  will occur on the same day as the Month 3 visit.  
Subjects will return to the clinic al site  on a monthly basis to receive study therapy even if there 
are no scheduled procedures.  This process will ensure subject compliance and accountability for 
distribution/return of study drug.  However, in cases  where access to the clinical  sites cannot 
occur monthly after Month 3, accommodations will be made to distribute  up to  3 months of 
study drug to match the 3 -month visit schedule.  
All suspected bleeding and TE endpoints as well as hepatic abnormalities ide ntified by the 
Investigator  will be adjudicated by the blinded CEC.  Adjudication packages will contain 
appropriate diagnostic tests, clinic notes, laboratory tests, discharge summaries, autopsy reports, 
etc used in the subject work -up following a suspected  event.  
6.1. Note Concerning Echocardiogram  
All subjects will have an echocardiogram at study screening to rule out asymptomatic 
thrombosis.  Subjects with evidence of symptomatic venous or arterial thrombosis  during study 
screening period  are not permitted in the study.  Valid echocardiograms are images taken within 5 
weeks prior to Randomization Visit .  
A follow -up echocardiogram will be taken at Month 3 to ascertain asymptomatic thrombosis.  IF 
there is a symptomatic thrombosis prior to Mo nth 3 which  would represent  a thrombotic event , it 
should be documented by the appropriate imaging procedure.  A Month 3 echocardiogram will 
NO LONGER be necessary at Month 3 visit if a symptomatic event was experienced by the 
subject  and was documented by an appropriate image . 
In the Extension Period  after Month 3 , any symptomatic event will be documented and a 
recommended image captured to support the event.  The Month 12 echocardiogram will be 
optional in all circumstances.  
A Month 3 echocardiogram is opti onal if the subject experiences a symptomatic TE documented 
by an image.  A reported post -Month 3 symptomatic TE should have a supporting appropriate

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 72 image.  If no symptomatic TE is reported during the Extension Period, the Investigator has the 
option to per form an echocardiogram at his/her discretion to rule out any asymptomatic TE at 
study discontinuation.  
The Schedule of Events for this study is provided in  Appendix  17.1.  
6.2. Screening /Qualification  Visit  (At Least Day -30 to Day 1, Visit  1) 
Any protocol -specified study q ualification procedures or tests not already done as part of routine 
care will be conducted only after the subject signs the ICF and before randomization.  
Central laboratory specimens will be collected to determine the baseline qualification of the 
subject for inclusion/exclusion criteria and ev aluation of particular analytes  over time across th e 
global study  except for INR and  aPTT  which are performed at the clinical site or local 
laboratory . 
All subjects at the Screening Visit should be  assessed  for INR and  aPTT evaluated at the local 
laboratory.  
Prior to signing the ICF, potenti al subjects and their parent(s) or guardian(s) will have the study 
risks and benefits explained, the associated ICF and assent form , if applicable , will be reviewed, 
and all questions answered for them.  Written informed consent must be signed by the parent (s) 
or guardian(s) of all subjects, and assent obtained from the child, when and where applicable, 
prior to entry into the study.  
 The Screening eCRF s must be completed for every subject with a signed ICF.  Any 
protocol -specified study qualification procedu res/tests identified for the Screening 
Visit, not already done as part of routine care  within 2 weeks of the Screening Visit  
will need to be conducted after the parent(s)  or guardian(s) signs the ICF  as part of 
the Screening/Qualification Visit .  
 The follo wing study qualification procedures  for the Screening/Qualification Visit  
must be completed to ensure that the subject is eligible for the study.  
 Review inclusion/exclusion criteria  
 Record demographic information (date of birth/age, sex, ethnicity, and ra ce) 
 Record medical/surgical history , including:  
 TE history and bleeding history since diagnosis of underlying disease and 
within the past 3 months  
 Date of diagnosis of underlying disease  
 Record prior medication (up  to 30 days prior to S creening) . Anticoagulant and 
antiplatelet therapy will be captured up to 3 month prior to Screening Visit  
 Assess for and record AEs and concomitant medications.  
 Perform physical examination  (Section  9.9) including:

or supine position [Note: the appropriate cuff size base on arm 
circumference will be used.] )  
 Height  and body weight (may be performed by an Investigator  or other 
healthcare provider designated by the Investigator ).  
 An aPTT and INR assessment will be done for all subjects at Screening at local 
laboratory . Ensure that the subject qualifies with regard to  the following central safety 
laboratory and radiology tests for exclusion criteria:  
 Echocardiogram . Note: Valid echocardiograms are images taken within 5  weeks 
prior to Randomization Visit . Note:  The presence of a thrombus will disqualify 
the subject from  the study.  
 Liver function assessments (ALT, AST, TBL, ALP) (central laboratory)  
 aPTT and INR ( assessed locally ) 
 Serum chemistry panel , serum creatinine , and eGFR  (central laboratory)  
 Hematology  (central laboratory)  
 Urinalysis  (at central laboratory  if dip stick is abnormal ) 
Note: Urinalysis can be done at local lab oratory . Resu lts of urinalysis performed at S creening by 
local lab oratory  may be used for qualification  
 To expedite qualification and randomization for subject s living a distance from the 
Investig ator site, the site may choose to use their local laboratory for screening 
eligibility labs.  The sample should be split with analysis at both the central laboratory 
as well as the local laboratory.  For the purpose of eligibility, the local laboratory 
resul ts (aPTT, INR, ALT, TBL, eGFR, and platelet)  will be utilized and entered into 
the eCRF.  
If subjects are ful filling eligibility conditions at the Screening/Qualification  Visit, the 
Investigator has the option to randomize the subject at any time within 30 days.  The Screening  
Visit  and Randomization Visit may occur on the same day.  
6.3. Randomization (Day 1, Visit 2 )  
Investigator s will maintain a confidential subject identification code list of names of all subjects 
randomized to study to allow the Investigator  to reveal the identity of any subject when 
necessary.  If all procedures and tests done before randomization confirm the subject’s eligibility 
(Section  6.2) for the study, then the IXRS will be contacted to randomize the subject .  
Urine pregnancy test in females of childbearing potential by definition are those females that 
have reached menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (defined 
as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause).  
Randomization may occur in IXRS the day prior to dosing for clinical logistics.  Screening Visit 
and Randomization  Visit  may occur on the same day.  The first dose  of study tr eatment may 
occur on Day 1 or  Day 2  (see Section  5.2.4 )

Page 74 The following activities should be done at the time of randomization . 
NOTE: For therapeutic moni toring of SOC t he Investigator will use discretion to 
decide when and how often to repeat INR or anti -FXa levels or aPTT measurements  
after randomization . These measurements will be taken and evaluated in the clinic, or 
alternatively, an optional site-specific local laboratory.  
NOTE: For subjects randomized to the edoxaban arm, a blood sample will be 
collected before the first dose of edoxaban for PD analysis only if the subject did not 
receive any heparin (UFH or LMWH) or VKA 24 hours prior to ran domization . 
 PD blood  sample for subjects randomized to edoxaban taken before dosing that day  
 Discretionary anti -FXa level and/or aPTT measurement for subjects on SOC with 
heparin and INR assessment for the subjects on SOC with VKA  
 Record any prior  and/or concomitant  medications used since the last visit.  
 Record any AEs since screening visit , including any bleeding events . 
 Urine pregnancy test (for post -menarchal females)  
 Physical examination for body weight only  
 Dispense study drug and record amou nt (number of tablets/bottles) dispensed . 
Prescription based, l ocally sourced SOC study therapy will need to be supported by a 
prescription identifying the type of SOC to be provided;  
 Explain the study drugs  and the proper daily dosing to the parent (s) or guardian (s) 
and subject (if applicable) using the study drug dosing calendar, and confirm that the 
subject understands the proper daily dosing of study drug. 
 Instruct subject to bring all medications including study drug packaging and bottles to 
each visit  (monthly visits even if there are no scheduled procedures) . 
 Complete the QOL Questionnaire.  Note the QOL can be filled out by EITHER a 
parent or the study participant.  The same person should complete the QOL at Month 
3. 
Parent(s) or guardian(s) or legally  acceptable representative parent(s) or guardian(s) and subject 
(if applicable) will be provided with information detailing symptoms suggestive of bleeding and 
TE. Parent(s), guardian(s) or subject will be asked to immediately contact the Investigator  if 
these symptoms occur.  
The following information  may be provided to the parent(s), guardian(s) or subject (information 
booklet):  
 The local medical contact person and emergency telephone number  
 The visit schedule  
 How to recognize and report signs and s ymptoms of possible bleeding and 
thromboembolic events (see Section  7.1 and Section  9.1).  
 How to use the study drugs  and instructions to keep empty medication packages

6.4. Main Treatment Period  
The Main Treatment Period is defined as the time from randomization until the end of Month 3 
of treatment . All treatment comparative analyses will be made during this time period.  
6.4.1.  Subj ects Randomized to the Edoxaban -Treatment A rm:  
For subjects randomized to the edoxaban arm, a blood sample will be collected before the first 
dose of edoxaban for PD analysis only if the subject did not receive any heparin  (UFH or 
LMWH ) or VKA  24 hours prior to randomization.  
6.4.2.  Subjects Randomized to the SOC -Treatment A rm:  
SOC will be provided by the Investigator . Alternatively, local supply depots within each country 
will provide SOC directly to the clinical sites.  Subject s will be treated wit h heparin (UFH or 
LMWH ) or VKA according to the site ’s SOC treatment  procedure . However, if there are 
regulatory or clinical site hurdles providing the SOC, the Sponsor wi ll provide SOC as 
enoxaparin or warfarin (see below).  
If Investigator s choose to use  the SOC supplied by the Sponsor, the subject will be treated as 
follows:  
 Enoxaparin  Subjects will be treated with enoxaparin alone or as a bridging therapy 
in combination with  warfarin during the initial study treatment period.  
 For subjects in whom clinicians prescribe warfarin, this will be started on Day  1. 
Heparin b ridging prior to reaching therapeutic levels by INR with warfarin may be 
performed depending on the clinical site’s practice . Bridging therapy will be provided 
by the Investigator  for the short duration.  The subject will continue warfarin for the 
remainder of the  study treatment period.  
The Investigator  will use discretion to decide when and how often to repeat INR or anti -FXa 
levels or aPTT measurements.  These measurements will be take n in the clinic, or alternatively, 
optional clinical site-specific local laboratory  (Appendix  17.1).  
6.4.3.  Monthly Visits (Months 1 and 2; Visits 3 and 4 ) for both arms:  
Starting with Randomization , subjects will return to the clinic every 30 days ±5 days (depending 
on the visit, see Schedule of Events in Appendix  17.1) until the Month 3 visit (Visit 5) or study 
withdrawal.  
During study drug interruptions and after study drug discontinuation, subjects will be followed 
for the protocol -specified study proce dures to assess the efficacy and safety endpoints and SAEs 
until the Month 3 visit (Visit 5).  If a subject discontinues study drug prior to The Main  Treatment 
Protocol  DU176b -C-U313

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 76 Period completion, the subject will continue to follow the protocol  procedures to Month 3 visit  
and have a 30-day Follow -Up Visit  (Visit 9).  
At these monthly on -site visits,  discretionary  anti-FXa levels assessments and /or aPTT 
measurements will be performed for the subjects on SOC with heparin and INR assessments will 
be performed for the subject on  SOC with VKA.  Additional interim visits may be scheduled, at 
the Investigator ’s discretion, for anti -FXa levels  and/or aPTT  and INR monitoring.  All 
therapeutic monitoring of SOC will be performed locally.  
6.4.3.1.  Month 1 Visit (Visit 3) Procedures  
The following w ill be performed at this visit:  
 Record concomitant medications  
 Count unused study drug tablets/ bottles/syringe and calculate compliance  
 Dispense study drug medication  and review dosing instructions  
 Perform physical examination  see Section  9.9 including:  
 Vital signs (BP, heart rate, and body temperature after resting in a sitting or

6.5. Extension Period  (beyond Month 3 – Month 6, 9 , and 12; Visits 6, 7,  
and 8) 
At the Investigator ’s discretion , study treatment can be extended up to 12 months.  All subjects 
will be offered edoxaban treatment for the duration of the Extension Period  based on the 
Investigator ’s judgment of the subject ’s potential thrombotic burden.   
For those subjects switching over from SOC to edoxaban in the extension period, the Principal 
Investigator may use discretion to schedule a visit if necessary and the visit should be 
documented on the designated Unscheduled page in eCRF.  
At any time during the Extension Period , a subject can discontinue treatment and the study.  In 
such a case , a discontinuation study visit will be performed with a subsequent 30 -day Follow -Up 
Visit  (see Table  17.1). 
The subjects on extended treatment will be followed for safety and efficacy assessment including 
bleeding events, TE occurrence , and AEs /SAEs  at visit for Months 6 (Visit 6), 9 (Visit 7), a nd 
12/Discontinuation Visit  (Visit 8).  Additionally, the subject will have a Follow -Up Visit  (Visit 9) 
for safety assessment 30 days after treatment cessation  or following Month 12, whichever is first . 
At Month 12/ Discontinuation Visit , or at any time the subject discontinues from the study after 
Month 3, the study drug will be collected from the subject and the subject will be switched to 
SOC anticoagulation treatment if necessary, at the discretion of the Investigator . All subjects 
who require continued S OC anticoagulation treatment at the end of study treatment in 
accordance with the current CHEST guidelines will be transitioned to the SOC determined by the 
Investigator . The transition algorithms are provided in Appendix  17.2. The visits will occur 
every 3 months .  
Edoxaban  dispensing will occur monthly  during the Extended Treatment Period even though 
protocol study procedures have not been scheduled to ensure dosing compliance and drug 
accountability . In cases where clinical visit are not possible every month, a 3 -month supply of 
edoxaban may be offered .

Details regard ing the definitions of the efficacy endpoints and how they will be assessed can be 
found in the CEC charter.  The CEC will adjudicate events in a blinded manner.  This adjudication 
will be independent of the Investigator s. The CEC will complete assessments o n an ongoing 
basis, and all information will be recorded in the clinical database.   
Subjects with suspected recurrent TE will undergo objective testing to assess the current episode.  
If possible, a blood sample will be obtained for PD analysis.  The followi ng documentation 
should be sent for adjudication:  
 Copies of all diagnostic imaging,  
 The TE adjudication worksheets,  
 eCRFs documents,  
 Source documents including but not limited to hospital discharge summaries, autopsy 
reports, consultation reports, X -rays/s canning reports, and clinical laboratory reports  
7.1. Assessments for Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
The efficacy  related  endpoints are any TE including thrombi in the systemic arterial  or venous 
pathways, intracardiac thrombi, DVT, PE, MI, SEE,  and stroke which occurred  during the study . 
This includes symptomatic TE and/or asymptomatic intracardiac thrombus . 
Diagnosis of TE should be performed per the clinical  site’s existing protocol but should include 
at minimum 1 of the following:  
 Asymptomatic intracardiac TE: The presence of an intra -luminal or mural thrombi 
within the cardiac chambers or surgical pathways on any cross -Section al imaging 
modality.  Mild laminar thickening of the internal surface of the Fontan pathway is not 
included.  Echocardiography is the preferred  modality in this setting.   
 Symptomatic SEE (except stroke) which includes: retinal, upper limb and lower limb, 
mesenteric.  
 The presence of cerebral infarction on computed tomography ( CT) or magnetic 
resonance imagining ( MRI ) (performed after symptoms)  
 The presence of symptomatic pulmonary embolism requires meeting 1 or more of the 
following criteria:  
 An intraluminal filling defect in segmental or more proximal branches of the 
pulmonary artery on multislice CT scan  
 A mismatched defect on a nuclear ventilati on/perfusion scan compared to the 
prior imaging,  
 A non -diagnostic lung scan accompanied by documentation of new DVT  by 
(Doppler) ultrasonography or venography.  
 Symptomatic DVT  requires meeting 1 of the following criteria:

 An intraluminal filling defect or venous obstruction on CT angiography.  
 An intraluminal filling defect or venous obstruction on MR venography.  
 Death as a result of a thromboembolic event, including pulmonary embolism.  All 
death s will be adjudicated by the C EC.  
 Diagnosis of fatal TE is based on 1 or more of the following:  
 Objective diagnostic testing,  
 Autopsy,  
 Death which cannot be attributed to a documented cause and for which TE 
cannot be ruled out.  
Diagnosis of symptomatic TE  requires the confirmation by appropriate diagnostic imaging (see 
imaging criteria of TE) and at least one of the symptoms of TE in the following table:

Page 89 8. PHAR MACOKINETIC/PHARMACO DYNAMIC ASSESSMENTS  
The timing and handling of blood samples for edoxaban -treated subjects for PK assessments and 
PD biomarkers are defined in Appendix  17.1. Plasma levels of edoxaban and its metabolite, 
D21-2393, will be measured  from subjects in the edoxaban -treatment arm . The primary PD 
biomarkers, anti -FXa activity will be assayed  from all edoxaban -treated subjects . For all sample 
collections, the study staff will record the date and time of last dose of study drug before sample 
collection and the date and time of the sample collection on the CRF . In addition, for PK 
samples, the date and time  of the last meal before sample collection must be recorded onto both 
the eCRF and the laboratory accession form.  
8.1. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessment (s) 
Up to 3 samples will be collected from subject s in the edo xaban -treatment arm over the course of 
the study for edoxaban and D21 -2393 analysis . Samples should be collected tubes with lithium 
heparin as anticoagulant.  
The following b lood samples for PK will be collected  at Month 1 Visit : 
 1 sample before the dose , 
 1 sample between 1 to 3 hours after the dose at the Month 1 visit,  
 If applicable, 1 sample at an event  classified as  TE or major or CRNM bleeding  
Note: It is critical to record the date/time of the last dose as well as the date/time of the last meal 
prior to each PK sample collection.  Collection information will be guided by the case report 
forms and guidelines.  
8.2. Pharmacodynamic (PD) Assessment (s) 
If bloo d volume restriction allows, b lood samples will be collected from edoxaban -treated  
subject s for assessment of PD biomarkers at the following time points : 
 Day 1  (at Randomization) : one sample prior to  first dose of edoxaban in tubes with 
citrate sodium as a nticoagulant  
 Month 1 Visit: one sample between 1 to 3 hours after the  edoxaban  dose at the Month 
1 Visit  at the time of PK specimen  
 If applicable, 1 sample at an event classified as  TE or major or CRNM bleeding  
The following biomarkers of coagulation will be determined : PT, aPTT, anti -FXa.

Page 91 9. SAFETY EVALUATION AN D REPORTING  
9.1. Assessment of Safety Endpoint(s)  
The safety endpoints related to safety objectives are bleeding events, including major, clinical 
relevant non -major and minor bleeding.  All potential bleeding events will be adjudicated by an 
independent CEC.  Study endpoints and safety data will be periodically reviewed by an IDMC to 
ensure the safety of study participants.  
Bleeding definitions are based on the ISTH modifie d recommendations1, 
 Major bleeding is defined as a composite (ie, any) of the following:  
 Fatal bleeding ; and/or  
 Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intra-spinal , 
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra-articular , pulmonary, or pericardial, or 
intramuscular with compartment syndrome ; and/or  
 Bleeding causing a decrease in hemoglobin lev el of 2 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) or 
more, or leading to transfusion of the equivalent of two or more units of whole 
blood or red cells.  
 A CRNM  bleed is an acute or sub-acute  clinically overt bleed that does not meet the 
criteria for a major bleed but prompts a c linical response, in that it leads to at least 
one of the following:  
 A hospital admission for bleeding, or  
 A physician guided medical or surgical treatment for bleeding, or  
 A change in antithrombotic therapy (including interruption or discontinuation of 
study drug).  
 Minor bleeding is defined as any other overt bleeding event that does not meet criteria 
for either major bleeding or clinically relevant, non -major bleeding.  
Minimal criteria defining a significant bleeding per ISTH10 are as follows : 
For each specific bleeding symptom, the ISTH/ Scientific and Standardization Committee ( SSC) 
joint working group proposed minimal criteria in order to classify a symptom as sig nificant:  
1. Epistaxis:  
 Any nosebleed, especially occurring after puberty that causes subject  concern (eg , 
interference or distress with daily or social activities) is considered significant.  
 In general, epistaxis should not be considered significant when i t lasts less than 10 
minutes, has a frequency of <5 episodes/year, has a seasonal occurrence, or is 
associated with infections of the upper respiratory tract or other identifiable cause 
(e.g., dusty dry air).  
2. Cutaneous bleeding:  
 Bruises are considered sig nificant when 5 or more (>1  cm) in exposed areas;  
Protocol  DU176b -C-U313  
Version 4 .0, 03 JUN  2019  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 92  Petechiae are considered significant when adequately described by the subject  or 
relatives;  
 Hematomas are considered significant when occurring without trauma.  
3. Minor cutaneous wound:  
 Any bleeding episode caused by superficial cuts (eg , by shaving razor, knife, or 
scissors) or that requires frequent bandage changes is considered significant.  
 Insignificant bleeding from wounds includes those of duration <10 minutes and 
lesions that usually require s titches in normal subjects (eg , under the chin).  
 Symptoms should also be manifest on more than 1 occasion to be considered 
significant.  
4. Oral cavity bleeding:  
 Gum bleeding should be considered significant when it causes frankly bloody sputum 
and lasts for 10 minu tes or longer on more than one occasion.  
 Tooth eruption or spontaneous tooth loss bleeding should be considered significant 
when it requires assistance or supervision by a physician, or lasts at least 10 minutes 
(bleeding associated with tooth extraction is considered separately).  
 Bleeding occurring after bites to lips, cheek, and tongue should be considered 
significant when it lasts at least 10 minutes or causes a swollen tongue or mouth.  
5. Hematemesis, melena, and hematochezia:  
 Any gastrointestinal bleeding that is not explained by the presence of a specific 
disease should be considered significant.  
6. Hematuria:  
 Only macroscopic hematuria (from red to pale -pink urine) that is not explained by the 
presence of a specific urologic disease should be consi dered significant.  
7. Tooth extraction:  
 Any bleeding occurring after leaving the dentist’s office and requiring a new, 
unscheduled visit or prolonged bleeding at the dentist’s office causing a delay in the 
procedure or discharge should be considered signific ant. 
8. Surgical bleeding:  
 Any bleeding judged by the surgeon to be abnormally prolonged, that causes a delay

more frequently than every 2 hours; menstrual bleeding last ing 7 or more days; and 
the presence of clots >1 c m combined with a history of flooding .  
10. Muscle hematomas or hemarthrosis.  
 Any spontaneous joint/ muscle bleeding (not related to traumatic injuries) is 
considered significant.  
11. Central nervous system bleedin g.  
 Any subdural or intra-cerebral  hemorrhage is considered significant  
All safety and efficacy e ndpoints described will be adjudicated  in a blinded manner by the CEC . 
The CEC will require all ava ilable details about the bleeding e vent and related informat ion to 
allow successful objective a djudication of the event.  Details may include, but are not limited to, 
information such as the following:  
 Location of the bleeding;  
 Duration of the bleeding;  
 Fatality  
 Treatment for bleeding ev ent, including notes or summa ry of the recommendations 
from a healthcare professiona l from whom medical treatment was obtained;  
 Magnitude of the bleeding  (including size if skin or subcutaneo us hematoma);  
 Hemoglobin levels at randomizati on and at the time of the bleed ing event, lowest  
value, pre - and post -transfusion values, and after re solution of the bleeding event;  
 Diagnostic tests done to evaluate th e bleeding such as endosc opy (gastrointestinal 
bleed), E NT consult (ear, nose, throat blee d), urology consult (hematuri a or 
urogenital  bleeding), surgical consult (skin and soft tissue, including in tra-abdominal 
bleeding), gynecological consult (uterine or vaginal bleeding),  neurological consult 
(intracranial bleed), or ophthalmology consult (intraocular ble ed); 
 Diagnostic scans (CT scans or MRIs), ultrasounds or X -rays performed to evaluate 
the bleeding (intracranial bleed)  
 Any other information that ca n be of help to the CEC to allow s uccessful objective 
adjudication of the bleeding event.  
9.2. Adverse Event Collection and Reporting  
In the event of a medical e mergency, the Investigator  at the clinical site  will institute any medical 
procedures deemed appropriate.  A 24 -hour Urgent Medical Contact will be provided to contact 
the Medical Monitor for further guidance.  
Sites will receive a  contact card where  the following numbers (24 -hour Urgent Medical Contact)

Page 94 The medical call center will contact Medical Monitor for the assigned region.  
All AEs (see Secti on 9.4.1  for definitions) occurring after the subject signs the ICF and up to 30 
days after the last dose of study drug (ie, the Follow -Up Visit ), whether observed by the 
Investigator  or reported by the subject, will be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF page.  
Medical conditions (including laboratory values/vital signs that are out of range) that were 
diagnosed or known to exist prior to Informed Conse nt will be recorded as part of medical 
history.   
All AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), bleeding, and events of special interest are to be 
reported according to the procedures in Section  9.5.  
All laboratory results and vital signs should be appraised by the Investigator  to determine their 
clinical significance.  Isolated abnormal laboratory results or vital sign findings should b e 
reported as AEs if they are symptomatic, lead to study drug discontinuation, lead to dose 
reduction, require corrective treatment, or constitute an AE in the Investigator ’s clinical 
judgment.  
At each visit, the Investigator  will determine whether any AEs  have occurred by evaluating the 
subject.  Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by the subject or by 
questioning the subject at each study visit.  Subjects should be questioned in a general way, 
without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms.  The Investigator  must assess all 
AEs to determine seriousness, severity, and causality, in accordance with the definitions in 
Section  9.4. The Investigator ’s assessment must be clearly documented in the site’s source 
documentation with the Investigator ’s signature.   
The Investigator must a lways report the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term.  When a diagnosis is 
unavailable, report  the primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details 
included in the narrative until the diagnosis becomes available.  If the signs and symptoms are 
distinct and do not suggest a common diagnosis, report them as individual entries of A E or SAE.   
For events that are serious due to hospitalization, the reason for hospitalization must be reported 
as the SAE  (diagnosis or symptom requiring hospitalization).  A procedure is not an AE or SAE, 
but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SA E. Pre-planned (prior to signing the ICF) 
procedures or treatments requiring hospitalization for pre -existing conditions that do not worsen 
in severity should not be reported as SAEs (see Section  9.4.2  for d efinitions).   
For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of death should a lways be reported as an SAE.  
Any serious, untoward event that may occur subsequent to the reporting period that the 
Investigator  assesses as related to study drug should also be reported and managed as an SAE.  
The Investigator  should follow subjects with adverse events until the event has resolved or the 
condition has stabilized.  In case of unresolved adverse events, in cluding significant abnormal 
laboratory values at the end of study assessment, these events will be followed until resolution or 
until they become clinically not relevant.

Page 95 9.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
9.3.1.  Liver Enzyme Abnormalities/Liver Dysfunction  
Liver function is an area of special interest . Critical liver laboratory assessments include ALT, 
AST, TBL, and ALP.  Particular attention will be paid to subjects with ALT and/or AST ≥3 × 
ULN and TBL ≥2 × ULN simultaneously without evidence of cholestasis (ALP  ≥2 × ULN is 
considered evidence of possible cholestasis) and without alternative etiology for hepatocellular 
damage.  
Liver enzyme abnormalities that lead to study drug interruption/discontinuation as well will be 
adjudicated in a blinded manner by the CE C. The CEC charter includes a process by which 
selected cases will be adjudicated by a liver disease specialist.  
In cases of liver laboratory abnormalities, it is important to ensure that the nature and the extent 
of liver injury is identified and study su bjects are monitored until the liver laboratory 
assessments return to normal.  
If the subject discontinued study drug due to liver enzyme abnormalities, the subject will have 
additional evaluations in order to determine the nature and severity of the liver injury . The 
documents to be sent for adjudication:  
 Results of confirmatory tests and diagnostic evaluation  
 The hepatic event adjudication worksheets.  
If a subject temporarily interrupts (or discontinues) study drug due to confirmed liver enzyme 
abnormaliti es or jaundice, the subject will have additional evaluations as described in 
Section  5.6.3  at the discretion of the Investigator . 
Combined elevations of aminotransferases and bilirubin, either serious or non -serious and 
whether or not causally related, meeting the clinical laboratory criteria of a potentia l Hy’s Law 
case [ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN with simultaneous  TBL ≥2 × ULN] should alw ays be reported to 
the Sponsor using a Serious Adverse Events Repo rting form, in addition to reporting it in eCRF, 
with the Investigator ’s assessment of seriousness, causality, and a detailed narrative.  These 
events should be reported within 24 hours of Investigator ’s awareness of the event.  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) may recommend termination of the study.  
Termination may be made for any of the following reasons:  
 Concern s about significantly higher bleeding risk relative to 1 of the study arms,  
 Concern s about drug -induced liver injury,  
 Any other safety concern s based on benefit/risk evaluation  by the IDMC . 
If the subject discontinues study drug due to liver enzyme abnormalities, the subject will have 
additional clinical and laboratory  evaluations until clinically acceptable resolution in order to 
determine the nature and severity of the potential liver injury.

Page 96 9.4. Adverse Event  
9.4.1.  Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event is a ny untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharm aceutical 
product  and that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product (ICH E2A Guideline.  
Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Oct 
1994).  
It is the responsibility of Invest igator s, based on their knowledge and experience, to determine 
those circumstances or abnormal lab oratory  findings which should be considered adverse events . 
9.4.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life -threatening,  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
 Is an important medical event.  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (ICH E2A Guideline.  Clinical  
Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Oct 1994).  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  Examples 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood dyscrasias or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Note:   
 Procedure s are not AE s or SAE s, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or 
SAE.   
 Pre-planned (prior to signing the ICF) procedures or treatment s requiring 
hospitalizations f or pre -existing conditions that do not worsen in severity are not 
SAEs.

Version 4 .0, 03 JUN  2019  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 97 9.4.3.  Severity Assessment  
The following definitions should be used to assess intensity of adverse events:  
 Mild: Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated, ie, does not interfere wit h 
subject’s usual function.  
 Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity.  
 Severe: Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity, ie, interferes 
significantly with subject’s usual function.  
Severity vs. Seriousness:  Severity is used to describe the intensity of a specific event while the 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  
This is not the same as "seriousness," which is based on subject /event outcome at th e time of the 
event.  
9.4.4.  Causality Assessment  
The Investigator  should assess causal relationship between an adverse event and the study drug  
or drugs if a combination is administered on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the 
following definitions.  The causality assessment must  be made based on the available information 
and can be updated as new information becomes available.  
 Related:  
 The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by t he subject’s clinical state or other factors 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications).  
Or 
 The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and is a known reaction to the drug under study or it s chemical group, or is 
predicted by known pharmacology.  
 Not Related:  
 The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from study drug administration, or 
can be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors (eg, 
disease under study, con current diseases, and concomitant medications).  
9.4.5.  Action Taken Regarding Study Drug (s) 
Dose Not Changed: No change in study drug dosage was made.  
Drug Withdrawn: The study drug was permanently stopped.  
Dose Reduced: The dosage of study drug was reduced.  
Drug Interrupted: The study drug was temporarily stopped.  
Dose Increased: The dosage of study drug was increased.  
Not Applicable: (eg , subject died, study tre atment had been completed prior to reaction/event, or 
reaction/event occurred prior to start of treat ment

None: No treatment was required.  
Medication required: Prescription and/or over-the-counter  medication was required to treat the 
adverse  event.  
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization required : Hospitalization wa s required or 
prolonged due to the AE, whether or not medication was required.  
Other.  
9.4.7.  Adverse Event Outcome  
 Recovered/Resolved  
 The subject fully recovered from the  adverse event with no resi dual effect 
observed.  
 Recovering/Resolving  
 The adverse event  improved but has not fully resolved.  
 Not Recovered/Not Resolved  
 The adverse event itself is st ill present and observable.  
 Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
 The residual effects of the adverse event are still present and  observable.  
 Include sequelae/residua l effects.  
 Fatal  
 Fatal should be used when death is a direct outcome of the adverse event.  
 Unknown  
9.5. Serious Adverse Events and Adverse  Event of Special Interest  
Reporting  – Procedure For Investigator s 
All AEs, SAEs,  and adverse events of special interest including efficacy and safety endpoints 
that will be adjudicated will be  reported in the CRF.  
In the event of a Medical Emergency, the Investigator  at the clinical site  will institute any 
medical procedures deemed appropriate.  A 24 -hour Urgent Medical Contact will be provided to 
contact the Medical Monitor for further guidance.  
Sites will receive a contact ca rd where the following numbers ( 24-hour Urgent Medical Contact) 
are provided:

Page 99 Fatal or life -threatening serious events that are also efficacy  or safety  endpoints will be reported 
as an expedited report to the regulatory agencies.  Events such as MI, SEE, str oke, VTE , and PE  
and/or safety endpoints such as bleeding events (which are not life -threatening or fatal) will be 
exempted from SAE processing and expedited reporting . Efficacy and safety endpoints will be 
captured on specifically designed eCRFs . These ev ents are clinically anticipated events in the 
target treatment population, and will be periodically reviewed by the IDMC to ensure prompt 
identification of any clinically concerning safety issues.  
The following types of events should be reported by the Investigator  on a Serious Adverse Event 
Report  form within 24 hours of awareness:  
 SAEs  (see Section  9.4.2  for definition) , including life -threatening or fatal bleeds.  
 All SAEs resulting in d eath, regardless of whether they are waived endpoints for 
processing and expedited reporting, will be processed by the CRO for entry into the 
Sponsor's global safety database.  
 Hepatic  events meeting combination abnor malities [ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN with 
simultaneous TBL ≥2 × ULN] (potential Hy’s Law case), both serious and non -
serious (see Section  9.3.1  for additio nal details).  
All events (serious and non -serious, including efficacy and safety endpoint events) must be 
reported with Investigator ’s assessment of the event’s seriousness, severity, and causality to the 
study drug.  A detailed narrative for SAE or hepatic  events meet ing the criteria , summarizing the 
course of the event, including its evaluation, treatment, and outcome should be provided.  
Specific or estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution should be included when 
available.  Medical history , concomitant medications, and laboratory data that are relevant to the 
event should also be summarized in the narrative.  For fatal events, the narrative should state 
whether an autopsy was or will be performed, and include the results if available.  Source  
documents (including medical reports) will be retained at the clinical site  and should not be 
submitted to the Sponsor for SAE reporting purposes.  
Urgent safety queries must be followed up and addressed promptly.  Follow -up information and 
response to non -urgent safety queries should be combined for reporting to provide the most 
complete data possible within each follow -up.  
See Section  15.12  for contact information for SAE reporting.  Please call your study monitor for 
any questions on SAE reporting.   
9.6. Notifying Regulatory Authorities, Investigator s, and Institutional 
Review Board /Ethics Committee  
Daiichi Sankyo Inc. and/or CRO will inform Investigator s, Institutional Review Boards /Ethics 
Committees ( IRBs/ ECs), and regulatory authorit ies of any suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) occurring in other clinical site s or other  studies of the study drug, as 
appropriate per local reporting requirements.  Daiichi Sankyo Inc. and/or CRO  will comply with 
any additional local safety reporting requirements.

Page 100 In the U nited States, upon receipt of the Sponsor’s notification of SU SARs that occurred with the 
study drug , unless delegated to the Sponsor, it is the Investigator ’s responsibility to inform the 
IRB per Sponsor’s instruction.  
In the Europea n Economic Area states, it is the Sponsor’s responsibility to report SUSARs to all 
ECs. 
9.7. Exposure In Utero During Clinical Studies  
Daiichi Sankyo  Inc. must be notified of any subject who becomes pregnant while receiving or 
within  30 days of discontinuing the study drug .  
Although pregnancy is not technically an adverse event, all pregnanci es must be followed to 
conclusion to determine their outcome.  This information is important for both drug safety and 
public health concerns.  It is the responsibility of the Investigator , or designee, to report any 
pregnancy in a female  subject using the exposure in utero (EIU) r eporting form.  Please contact 
your study monitor to receive the EIU Reporting Form upon  learning of a pregnancy.  The 
Investigator  should make every effort to follow the subject  until completion of the pregnancy and 
complete the EIU Reporting Form with complete pregnancy outcome information, including 
normal delivery and induced abortion.  The adverse pregnancy outcome, either serious or non -
serious, should be reported in accordance with study procedures.  If the out come of the pregnancy 
meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (ie, post -partum complications, 
spontaneous or induced abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, including that 
in an aborted fetus), the Investigator  should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs outlined in 
Section  9.5.  
9.8. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
To expedite qualification and randomization for subject s living a distance from the Investigator 
site, the site may choose to use their local laboratory for screening eligibility labs.  The sample 
should be split with analysis at both the central laboratory as well as the local laboratory.  For the 
purpose  of eligibility, the local laboratory results will be utilized and entered into the eCRF.  
Blood and urine samples  (if abnormal by dipstick)  for clinical laboratory evaluations will be 
shipped to a central laboratory for analysis.  Results of all clinical laboratory tests will be reported 
in the subject’s eCRF or merged electronically with the clinical database.  
9.8.1.  Hematology  
The ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid tube of blood will be drawn for the hematology assessments 
listed in.  Thes e will be measured from sa mples obtained at the Screening /Qualification visit

11.1. General Statistical Considerations  
All efficacy analyses will be based on the modified intention -to-treat ( mITT ) Analysis Set and 
will be performed based on the treatment group assigned at randomization.   
Safety analysis will be performed using the Safety Analysis Set.  Subjects will be  analyzed 
according to actual treatment received.  
All analys es for the Extension Period  will be based on subjects who participate in the Extension 
Period  and take only edoxaban in the Extension Period , in the specified analysis set, and will be 
summarized for the edoxaban treatment group.  Data listings wi ll be prepared for subjects who 
are randomized to the SOC arm, participate in the Extension Period , and do not switch to 
edoxaban right after the Month 3 Visit.  
All confidence intervals will be descriptive and will be two -sided 95% confidence interval  (CI), 
unless otherwise specified.  
Unless otherwise specified, the baseline value of an efficacy variable for a subject is the last non -
missing measurement before the randomization , and the baseline value of a safety variable is the 
last non -missing measurement  before the first dose of the study drug.  
In general, missing data will not be imputed for the purpose of data analysis.  No visit windows 
will be used for analysis.  
Continuous variables will be summarized by the number of observations, mean, standard 
devia tion, median, and minimum and maximum values . Categorical variables will be 
summarized using frequency counts and percentages.  Summary statistics will be presented by 
treatment group.  
There is no formal statistical interim analysis planned . However, after the first 50  subjects  
enrolled in the edoxaban tr eatment group and 25 subjects enrolled in the SOC treatment group  
complete the  first 3 -month treatment period, an interim assessments by IDMC of safety 
endpoints will be performed to allow for  enrollment of subjects <1 year of age into study.  
11.2. Analysis Sets  
Randomized Analysis Set  will include all subjects who sign the ICF and are randomized.   
Safety Analysis Set  will include all subjects in the Randomized Analysis Set who received at 
least 1 dose of study drug. Analysis will be based on the stud y drug the subject actually received . 
mITT Analysis Set  will include all subjects in the Randomized Analysis Set who received at 
least 1 dose of study drug . Analysis will be based on the study  drug the subject was ra ndomized 
to receive.  
PK Analysis Set  will include all subjects in the Safety Analysis Set who had at least 1 PK sample 
with measurable concentration.   
PD Analysis Set  will include all subjects in the Safety Analysis Set who had at least 1 
measurable PD sample.

11.4.1.2.  Exploratory Efficacy Analysis  
The combination of symptomatic TE and asymptomatic  intracardiac thromb us, deaths as a result  
of TE, and all -cause mortality will also be analyzed for periods and subjects below:  
 Events from randomization to the date of last dose of study drug plus 30 days  for 
subjects who do not participate  in the  Extensi on Period  
 Events from the day after the Month 3 Visit to the data of last dose of study  drug for 
subjects who participate in the Extension Period  
 Events occurring from randomization to the Month 3 Visit or to the date of last dose 
of study drug  plus 3 days if study treatment is discontinued in the Main Treatment 
Period , whichever is earlier . 
To assess the efficacy for intra -patient between the Main Treatment  Period and previous 
anticoagulant regimen, TE history since diagnosis of underlying disea se and within the p rior 3 
months to randomization will be collected.  The incidence of TE and annualized event rate  in the 
3 months prior to randomization and during the Main Treatment  Period will be calculated for 
subjects  who have both pre -randomization a nd post -randomization data  available . This analysis 
will be based on Investigator -reported events.  
To compare edoxaban regimen with available existing historical control data, a literature review 
and a search for registered clinical trials with similar end points  will be conducted . The available 
results of control data will be extracted and tabulated together with the results of the Main 
Treatment  Period from this study.   
TE will also be classified as primary prevention events and secondary prevention events  based 
on thrombosis history, and summarized by treatment group for ev ents occurring during the Main

Page 108 Treatment  Period  and from  the day after the Month 3 Visit to the date of last dose of study 
treatment plus 30 days , respectively.  Due to the small sample s ize of the study, further 
stratification by primary and secondary prevention is not feasible . Hence, caution is needed in 
the interpretation of the result, especially when imbalance occurred between two groups.  
11.4.2.  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic /Biomarker  Analyses  (Edoxaban Subjects 
Only)  
Plasma concentration and biomarker data will be summarized by age, dose and time point using 
descriptive statistics.  The plasma concentration data will be pooled with data from other studies 
for a population PK analysis using  nonlinear mixed effects modeling.  
Exposure -response relationships will be evaluated for the safety and efficacy endpoints through a 
model based approach, if data allow , and will be reported separately .  
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data will be a nalyzed separately and reported 
separately.  The plasma concentrations of edoxaban and its metabolite, D21 -2393 , as well as the 
PD measures will be listed and summarized by age, dose and time point.  
11.4.3.  Safety Analysis  
11.4.3.1.  Analysis of Bleeding Events  
The primary sa fety endpoint is the composite of major and CRNM bleeding events that occur 
during the Main Treatment Period : from  the date of first dose of study drug to the Month 3 Visit, 
or to the date of last dose of study drug plus 3 days if study treatment is discontinued , whichever 
is earlier . This analysis will be based on CEC adjudication results.  
The time to major or CRNM bleeding  occurring during the Main Treatment Period  will be 
compared between treatment groups for subjects in the Safety Analysis Set, us ing the Cox 
proportional hazards regression model with treatment group, concomitant usage of aspirin at 
baseline, and underlying disease  (Kawasaki disease, Fontan surgery, heart failure or Other ) as 
covariates.  Hazard ratio between edoxaban and SOC treatme nt group will be calculated with 
corresponding 95% CI.  The incidence, annualized event rate, and rate difference between 
edoxaban and SOC treatment groups will also be calculated.  
In addition, incidence, annualized event rate  and rate difference between ed oxaban and SOC 
treatment groups with corresponding 95% CI will be calculated for following endpoints for 
Safety Analysis Set for the Main Treatment Period . Incidence and annualized event rate will also 
be calculated for the following endpoints occurring  from the day after Month 3 Visit to date of 
last dose of study drug plus 30 days  in the Extension Period . 
 Major and CRNM bleeding event  combined  
 Major bleeding event  
 All bleeding event (major, CRNM, and minor bleeding  combined ) 
The above 3  categories of bleeding endpoints will also be summarized for the periods and 
subjects below:

Page 109  Incidence, annualized event rate , and rate difference will be calculated for events 
occurring  from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of last dose of study 
drug plus 30 days for subjects who do not participate  in the  Extension Period . 
 Incidence and  annualized event rate will be calculated for events occurring from the 
day after Month 3 Visit to the data of last dose of study drug for subjects who 
participate  in the  Extension Period . 
To assess the safety for intra -patient between the Main  Treatment  Period and previous 
anticoagulant regimen, bleeding history since diagnosis of underlying disease and within the past 
3 month s of randomization will be collected.  The incidence of bleeding events and annualized  
event rate  in the 3 months prior to randomization and during the Main Treatment  Period will be 
calculated for the subjects  who have both pre -randomization and post -randomi zation data  
available . This analysis will be based on Investigator  reported events.  
To compare edoxaban regimen with available existing historical control data for bleeding, a 
literature review and a search for registered clinical trials with similar endpo ints will be 
conducted . The available results of control data will be extracted and tabulated together with the 
results of the Main  Treatment  Period from this study.   
11.4.3.2.  Analysis of Hepatic Events  
The analysis of hepatic events will be based on CEC adjudicati on results . All CEC adjudication 
confirmed hepatic events will be summarized for the characteristics of the hepatic events by 
treatment group for the Main Treatment  Period and for the Extension Period . 
11.4.3.3.  Adverse Event Analyses  
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that occur, having been absent before the 
study treatment administration, or worsen in severity after the initiation of study treatment 
administration.   
Adverse events will be coded according to the Medical Dicti onary for Regulatory Acti vities.  
The number and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs will be calculated overall, by system 
organ class, by preferred term, and by treatment group for the Main Treatment  Period and for the 
Extension Period . TEAEs will be further summarized by sever ity and relationship to study drug.  
Similarly, the number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment -emergent SAEs will be 
tabulated, as well as TEAEs leading to discontinuation from study treatments and death events.  
A by -subject AE (including treatme nt-emergent) data listing including but not limited to 
verbatim term, preferred term, system organ class, severity, and relationship to study treatment 
will be provided . Deaths, other SAEs, and other significant AEs, including those leading to 
discontinuat ion from study treatments, will be listed.  
11.4.3.4.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the  clinical laboratory results by scheduled time of 
evaluation and by treatment group for the Safety  Analysis Set , as well as fo r the change from 
baseline for the parameters which planned to collect both at baseline and post -baseline  in the 
Main Treatment Period . The baseline value is defined as the last non -missing value before the

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 110 initial administration of study treatment . In add ition, mean change from baseline will be 
presented by treatment group for the maximum and minimum post -treatment values and the 
values at the Month 3 Visit . 
Similar summaries will also be provided for clinical laboratory results by scheduled time of 
evalua tion during the Extension Period , as well as for the change from Month 3 Visit to the visits  
after Month 3 . 
Abnormal  clinical  laboratory results will be included a by -subject data listing.  
11.4.3.5.  Vital Sign Analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the vital signs measurements by scheduled time of 
evaluation and by treatment group for the Safety Analysis Set , as well as for the change from 
baseline  in the Main Treatment Period . The baseline value is defined  as the last non -missing 
value before the initial administration of study treatment.  
Similar summaries will also be provided for vital signs by scheduled time of evaluation during 
the Extension Period , as well as for the change from Month 3 Visit to the vi sits after Month 3 . 
11.4.4.  Other Endpoint  Analysis  
Descriptive statistics for QOL score at baseline and Month 3 will be summarized for each 
question, each dimension, and overall by treatment group and QOL specified age group for 
Safety Analysis Set.  
11.5. Interim Asses sment  
No formal statistical interim analysis is planned.  However, an interim assessment by the IDMC 
of safety endpoints of the study will take place after the first 50 subjects in the edoxaban 
treatment group  and 25 subjects in the SOC arm  from 1 to <18 ye ar of age  complete the first 3 
months of treatment.  This will allow for enrollment of subjects <1 year of age.  
11.6. Sample Size Determination  
A sample size of 150 subjects was chosen for this study.  This s tudy is not a powered study 
intended to draw conclusions  based on statistically significant differences between edoxaban and 
SOC.  An adequately powered study would be unachievable due to the significantly large sample 
size required and the enormous challenge to enroll these pediatric patients.  Although the sample 
size is not based on statistical consideration, assuming major and CRNM bleeding event rates 
(which are the primary endpoints for this study) are the same as observed in adult Hokusai -VTE 
Study, (ie, 8.5% and 10.3% in edoxaban and SOC arms, respecti vely); with 100 subjects in 
edoxaban arm and 50 subjects in standard of care arm, the 95% CI around the point estimate of 
the risk difference between edoxaban and SOC is -11.8%, 8.2%. . 
11.7. Statistical Analysis Process  
The clinical  study will be analyzed by the S ponsor or its agent/CRO.  
The statistical analysis plan  (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the 
analysis of the efficacy and safety data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for

 Other applicable local regulations.  
15.2. Subject Confidentiality  
The Investigator s and the Sponsor will preserve the confidentiality of all subjects taking part in 
the study, in accordance with GCP and local regulations.  
The Investigator  must ensure that the subject’s anonymity is maintained.  On the CRFs or other 
documents submitted to the Sponsor or the CRO, subjects should be identified by a unique 
subject identifier as designated by the Sponsor.  Documents that are not for submission to  the 
Sponsor or the CRO (eg, signed ICF) should be kept in strict confidence by the Investigator . 
In compliance with ICH GCP Guidelines, it is required that the Investigator  and institution 
permit authorized representatives of the company, of the regulator y agency(s), and the IRB/EC 
direct access to review the subject’s original medical records for verification of study -related 
procedures and data.  The Investigator  is obligated to inform the subject that his/her study -related 
records will be reviewed by the  above named representatives without violating the 
confidentiality of the subject.  
15.3. Informed Consent  
Before a subject’s participation in the study, it is the Investigator ’s responsibility to obtain freely 
given consent and assent, in writing, from the subj ect after adequate explanation of the aims, 
methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol -specific 
procedures or any study drugs are administered.  Subjects should be given the opportunity to ask 
questions and rec eive satisfactory answers to their inquiries, and should have adequate time to 
decide whether or not to participate in the study.  The written ICF should be prepared in the local 
language(s) of the potential subject population.  
Protocol  DU176b -C-U313  
Version 4 .0, 03 JUN  2019  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 118 In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the Investigator  should comply with the 
applicable regulatory requirements, and should adhere to GCP and to the ethical principles that 
have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The consent form and any revision(s) should be 
appro ved by the IRB/EC prior to being provided to potential subjects.  
The subject’s written informed consent along with the legal guardian(s) should be documented in 
the subject’s medical records.  The ICF should be signed and personally dated by the subject and  
by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion (not necessarily the Investigator ). 
The original signed ICF should be retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of 
the signed consent form should be provided to the subject.  The date and time (if applicable) that 
informed consent was given should be recorded on the CRF.  
Suggested model text for the ICF and assent for the study and any applicable subparts (genomic, 
PK, etc) are provided in the Sponsor’s ICF template for the Inves tigator  to prepare the 
documents to be used at his or her clinical site . Updates to applicable forms will be 
communicated via letter from the Sponsor . 
For studies in the US, an additional consent is required for the Health Insurance Portability and 
Account ability Act. 
According to 21 CFR 50.55 subpart b it states, “In determining whether children are capable of 
providing assent, the IRB must take into account the ages, maturity, and psychological state of 
the children involved . This judgment may be made for  all children involved in clinical 
investigations under a particular protocol, or for each child , as the IRB deems appropriate.  In 21 
CFR 50.55 subpart g it states, “When the IRB determines that assent is required, it must also 
determine whether an d how assent must be documented ”. For this study, the IRB will determine 
the age that is appropriate for the assent . Generally, this age averages at 7 years of age . The IRB 
will also determine the verbiage that may be added, as well as ensure the document is wri tten at a 
level understandable to the population who will be signing the assent . The IRB may also require 
separate assent forms based on the age groups (ie, separate assent forms for subjects 7 to 12 
years and for subjects 13 to 17 years) to ensure the ass ents maintain their “maturity levels and 
understandability”.  
15.4. Regulatory Compliance  
The study protocol, subject information and consent form, the Investigator ’s Brochure, any 
subject written instructions to be given to the subject, available safety informat ion, subject 
recruitment procedures (eg, advertisements), information about payments and compensation 
available to the subjects , and documentation evidencing the Investigator ’s qualifications should 
be submitted to the  EC or IRB for ethical review and appr oval according to local regulations, 
prior to the study start.  The written approval should identify all documents reviewed by name 
and version.  
Changes in the conduct of the study or planned analysis will be documented in a protocol 
amendment and/or the SA P. 
The Investigator  must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the EC or IRB for all 
subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the ICF.  The Investigator  should notify the EC 
Protocol  DU176b -C-U313

reports received from the Sponsor/CRO, in accordance with local procedures.  
As required by local regulations, the Sponsor’s local Regulatory Affairs group or representative 
to whom this responsibility has been delegated will ensure  all legal aspects are covered, and 
approval from  the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, prior to study initiation, and that 
implementation of changes to the initial protocol and other relevant study documents happen 
only after approval by the relevan t regulatory bodies.  
In the event of any prohibition or restriction imposed ( eg, clinical hold) by an applicable  
regulatory  authorit y in any area of the world, or if the Investigator  is aware of any new  
information which might influence the evaluation of t he benefits and risks of the  investigational 
drug, the Sponsor  should be informed immediately.   
In addition, the Investigator  will inform the Sponsor  immediately of any urgent safety measures  
taken by the Investigator  to protect the study subjects  against any immediate hazard, and of  any 
suspected/actual serious  GCP  non-compliance  that the Investigator  becomes aware of.  
15.5. Protocol Deviations  
The Investigator  should conduct the study in compliance with the protocol agreed to by Sponsor 
and, if require d, by the regulatory authority(ies), and which was given approval/favorable 
opinion by the IRBs/ECs . 
A deviation to any protocol procedure or waiver to any stated criteria will not be allowed in this 
study except where necessary to eliminate immediate haza rd(s) to the subject.  Sponsor must be 
notified of all intended or unintended deviations to the protocol (eg, inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
dosing, missed study visits) on an expedited basis.  
The Investigator , or person designated by the Investigator , should document and explain any 
deviation from the approved protocol.  
If a subject was ineligible or received the incorrect dose or study  treatment, and had at least 1 
administration of study drug , data should be collected for safety purposes.  
If applicabl e, the Investigator  should notify the IRBs/ECs of deviations from the protocol in 
accordance with local procedures.  
15.6. Supply of New Information Affecting the Conduct of the Stud y 
When new information becomes available that may adversely affect the safety of subjects or the 
conduct of the study, the Sponsor will inform all Investigator s involved in the clinical study, 
ECs/IRBs, and regulatory authorities of such information, and when needed, will amend the 
protocol and/or subject information.  
The Investigator  should immediately inform the subject whenever new information becomes 
available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent or may influence the subject’s willingness 
to continue participation in the study.  The communication should be documented on med ical 
records, for example, and it should be confirmed whether the subject is willing to remain in the 
study.

Page 120 If the subject information is revised, i t must be re -approved by the IRB/EC. The Investigator  
should obtain written informed consent to continue p articipation with the revised written 
information even if subjects were already informed of the relevant information.  The Investigator  
or other responsible personnel who provided explanations and the subject should sign and date 
the revised ICF.  
15.7. Protocol A mendments  
Any amendments to the study protocol that seem to be appropriate as the study progresses will 
be communicated to the Investigator  by Daiichi Sankyo  Inc. or the CRO . Also, the Sponsor will 
ensure the timely submission of amendments to regulatory a uthorities.  
A global protocol amendment will affect study conduct at all clinical site s in all regions of the 
world.  Such amendments will be incorporated into a revised protocol document.  Changes made 
by such amendments are documented in a Summary of Chang es section in the protocol 
amendment . These protocol amendments will undergo the same review and approval process as 
the original protocol.   
A local protocol amendment will affect study conduct at a particular clinical site (s) and/or in a 
particular region /country.  Sponsor approval of local amendments will be clearly documented.  
A protocol amendment may be implemented after it has been approved by the IRB/EC and by 
regulatory authorities where appropriate, unless immediate implementation of the change is 
necessary for subject safety.  
15.8. Study Termination  
The Independent Data  Monitoring Committee (IDMC) may recommend termination of the study.  
Termination may be made for any of the following reasons:  
 Concern about significantly higher bleeding risk relative to one of the study arms,  
 Concern about drug -induced liver injury,  
 Any other safety concern based on benefit/risk evaluation.  
The IDMC will alert the Investigator /designee if there are any of the above concerns requiring 
protocol modifications or any other ch anges in the study.  
The details about the roles and responsibilities of the IDMC and guidelines and rules for 
monitoring the study safety data will be described further in the IDMC charter.  
15.9. Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An Independent Data Monitori ng Committee (IDMC) will be created to further protect the rights, 
safety, and well -being of subjects who will be participating in this study by monitoring their 
progress and results.  The IDMC will comprise of qualified scientists, who are not Investigator s 
in the study and not otherwise directly associated with the Sponsor.  The IDMC will be described 
in detail in the IDMC Charter . The IDMC will monitor data during the study.  All activities of the 
IDMC will be documented.  This documentation will include dat a summaries and analyses 
provided to the committee as well as minutes of the meeting.  The IDMC can recommend study 
Protocol  DU176b -C-U313  
Version 4 .0, 03 JUN  2019  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 121 or treatment regimen/group termination to a study oversight committee based on pre -specified 
concerns described in the IDMC Charter.  
An inde pendent CRO study statistician will prepare the required data outputs and provide the 
outputs to the IDMC as per the IDMC charter.  The statistician will prepare overall summary 
reports for the data including, but not limited to, subject disposition, subjec t demographics and 
baseline characteristics, subject treatment duration, subjects with bleeding (adjudicated by the 
CEC), subjects with liver enzyme and bilirubin abnormalities, subjects with SAEs, deaths, 
subjects permanently discontinued from study drug due to AEs, and subjects with efficacy 
endpoints such as VTE and cardiovascular mortality, and all -cause mortality etc.  
Further details concerning the IDMC responsibilities, structure, and the frequency of committee 
meetings are elaborated in the IDMC char ter. Briefly the IDMC will meet to review the study 
safety data when 10%, 25%, 50% , and 75% of subjects complete Month 3 of any study 
treatment.  In addition, the IDMC will review the edoxaban exposure analysis from the U157 
study in addition to the safety data from each age cohort to approve  the proposed dose for the 
same age cohort in the U313 study . 
Additionally subjects less than 1 year of age will be admitted to the study after the review by the 
IDMC of safety data of 50% subjects in 1 to <18 years of a ge group who have complet ed the 
Main Treatment P eriod of 3 months (50 subjects in edoxaban arm and 25 subjects in SOC arm).  
15.10.  Clinical Events Committee  
An independent study specific CEC will review and adjudicate key endpoint events (bleedings, 
all types of TE, stroke, MI,  deaths, liver enzyme abnormalities requiring study drug 
discontinuation) without unblinding.  Endpoints reported during telephone contacts will also be 
adjudicated.   
The CEC will comprise qualified judges, who are not Investigator s in the st udy and not 
otherwise directly associated with the Sponsor.  The CEC judges will remain blinded to treatment 
throughout the adjudication process and the study.  The CEC adjudicated data will be used in the 
final efficacy and safety analyses.  The CEC and the events and radiologic images it will 
adjudicate will be detailed in the CEC Charter.  
15.11.  Steering Committee/Executive Committee  
A Study Steering Committee will be created to provide academic and clinical guidance on study 
implementation and conduct of the stud y, and interpretation of results as specified in the 
Committee Charter.  It may consist of Principal Investigator (s), and /or key opinion leaders, as 
well as designated Sponsor and CRO members.  
15.12.  Address List  
A list of key study personnel (including personnel at the Sponsor, CRO, laboratories, and other 
vendors) and their contact information (address, telephone, fax, email) will be kept on file and 
regularly updated as necessary .

Page 131 17.3. Effective Methods of Birth Control  
Women of childbearing age are defined as those females that have reached menarche and until 
becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (defined as no menses for  12 months 
without an alternative medical cause)  and are eligible for the study based on the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria . 
Female subjects of childbearing potential must test negative for pregnancy at Randomization 
(with a highly sensitive test)  and mu st consent to avoid becoming pregnant by using an approved 
contraception method throughout the study.  
The following use of reliable method(s) of contraception, and/or abstinence, for the duration of 
therapeutic product exposure is recommended:  
Highly effective methods of contraception, when used consistently and correctly, result in 
low failure rates.  These may include:  
 Combined (estrogen and progesterone -containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation  
 Oral 
 Intravaginal  
 Tran sdermal  
 Progresterone -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
 Oral 
 Injectable  
 Implantable  
 Intrauterine d evice (IUD)  
 Intrauterine hormonal -releasing s ystem  
 Bilateral tubal o cclusion  
 Vasectomized partner  
 Sexual a bstinence  
Effecti ve methods may include:  
 Barrier methods of contraception (eg, male condom, female condom, cervical cap, 
diaphragm, contraceptive sponge).   
Note: When used consistently and correctly, "double barrier" methods of 
contraception (eg, male condom with diaphragm, male condom with cervical cap) 
can be used as an effective alternative to the highly effective contraception 
methods described above.  
Only in individual cases where the stable use of highly effective methods is medically 
contraindicated (investigator’s written documentation required), double barrier methods may be 
acceptable.

17.5.6.  P-gp Inducer s (Prohibited Medication)  
Rifampin is a P -gp inducer that has been shown to lower the edoxaban exposure   Therefore, 
concomitant use of rifampin is contraindicated during the treatment period.  Other P -gp induces 
may lead to a lower exposure of edoxaban than predicted for clinical efficacy.  The example 
medications listed below (but not limited to) have not been tested with edoxaban but are also P -
gp inducers . These should be avoided during the study as their use may lead to a lower exposure 
of edoxaban than predicted for clinical ef ficacy.  (http://www.straighthealthcare.com/p -
glycoprotein.html#inducers).  
 Rifampin  
 Carbamazepine (Tegretol®)

17.6.1.  P-gp Inhibitor s List  
Use of P -gp inhibitors during the treatment with edoxaban will require dose reduction either at 
randomization or during the course of the study . These drugs can potentially raise the exposure 
level of edoxaban.  The only exemption from this rule is the use of amiodarone which will not 
require dose reduction.

Page 137 17.7. Transition From Edoxaban to Other A nticoagulants  
Subjects who require anticoagulation at the end of study participation will be transitioned to 
standard -of-care treatment as directed by the Investigator  or treating physician.   
At the end of edoxaban treatment, the subject will receive the last dose of edoxaban and all 
remaining edoxaban tablets/bottles will be collected from the subject by site staff.  
Subjects transitioning  from edoxaban  to any VKA will have their INR recorded at last study 
visit.  Bridging with heparin may occur during VKA titration until the INR is at  a therapeutic 
level of 2 to 3. 
INR will need to be measured as frequently as necessary until the INR target of ≥2.  Once the 
INR is ≥2.0 the heparin will be stoppe d and the subject will continue on the VKA alone.  
When transitioning from edoxaban to another direct oral anticoagulant (e.g. rivaroxaban, 
apixaban, dabigatran):  
 The first dose of the direct oral anticoagulant of choice will be given 24 hours post 
the last  dose of edoxaban and will then be continued as per the novel anticoagulant’s 
label.  
For subjects who do not complete the Main Treatment Period, they will be followed with 
monthly visits until the end of Month 3 and have a 30 -day Follow -Up Visit  according to the 
Schedule of Events ( Appendix  17.1).  
For subjects who complete  the Main Treatment Period but do not continue into the Extension 
Treatment Period, the subjects will receive a Discontinuation Visit  and a Follow -Up Visit , 30 
days after last dose of study drug . 
For subjects who continue into th e Extension Period , the Follow -Up Visit  will occur 30 days 
after the Discontinuation Visit  (Month 12, Visit 8) .

Page 138 17.8. Management of Serious/Life -Threatening Bleeding  
The following steps are curren tly recommended for subjects with ongoing major bleeding (see 
Section  9.1): 
 Withhold study drug and all antiplatelets/anticoagulants  
 Institute SOC  for major bleeding (large bore IV or central venous line, type and 
crossmatch blood, admit to the intensive care unit, provide hemodynamic and 
respiratory support)  
 Administer packed red blood cells (or whole blood) as needed  
 Administer antidotes if applic able 
For UFH/ LMWH:   
The antidote for UFH/ LMWH is protamine sul fate. The dose of protamine sulf ate given is 
dependent upon the dose of UFH/ LMWH administered and the time of administration.  
Suggestions from the Sponsor:  
 If protamine is given within 8 hours of the UFH/ LMWH then a maximum 
neutralizing dose is 1 mg protamine/100 units (or 1  mg) of UFH/ LMWH given in the 
last dose.  
 If more than 8 hours have passed since the dose of UFH/ LMWH was given, 
administer 0.5 mg protamine per 1  mg (100 units) of UFH/ LMWH g iven.  
Protamine is administered by slow IV infusion (over 10 minutes) to avoid a hypotensive 
reaction.  Protamine is a medication that requires a high level of caution when being prescribed 
and administered.  Outside cardiac surgery and intensive care unit (ICU) , consultant or fellow 
approval is required for the use of protamine - do not allow this to lead to delayed administration 
in the case of bleeding.  Contact the appropriate senior person immediately.  
For Warfarin:  
If a subject has s ignificant but not li fe-threatening bleeding: Administer Vitamin K 0.5  mg to 2 
mg SC (NOT intramuscularly) plus fresh frozen plasma (20 mL/kg IV) to a maximum of 4 units.  
If a subject has m ajor bleeding (any INR) or requir es emergency surgery doses because their  
INR >8 :  
 Stop Warfarin  
 Vitamin K (30 µg/kg) IV, consider higher doses if INR >8  
 Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) replacement therapy ( To note:  fresh frozen 
plasm a gives inferior correction and is not recommended):  
 Beriplex® [4 -factor Prothrombin Complex Concentrate  approved in several 
European  countries] (and Kcentra® approved in the U nited States) (Discuss with 
on call h ematologist) . Beriplex dosage is calculated based on the current INR  and 
subject’s weight (see Table  17.6) 
 Repeat the INR following PCC

INR Approximate Dose 
2.0-3.9 1 mL/kg = 25 IU/kg 
4.0-6.0 1.4 mL/kg = 35 IU/kg 
>6.0 2 mL/kg = 50 IU/kg 
For Edoxaban:  
Although not evaluated in cli nical trials, PCC, activated PCC, or recombinant Factor VIIa could 
be considered for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of edoxaban.  In healthy volunteers, a 3 -
factor PCC restored thrombin generation (area under the curve  for thrombin generation curve ) 
but did not normalize PT.  Thus, a 3 -factor PCC may be of some value in reversing a nticoagulant 
effects of edoxaban (Study A -U150). 
A specific reversal agent for edoxaban is not available.  Although not evaluated in subjects, PCC 
(Beriplex® or Kcentra®), a ctivated PCC , or recombinant Factor VIIa could be considered for the 
reversal of the  anticoagulant effect of edoxaban.  
The following are not expected to reverse the anticoagulant eff ects of edoxaban:  
 Protamine sulfate,  
 Vitamin K,  
 Tranexamic acid.  
Hemodialysis does not significa ntly contribute to edoxaban clea rance.

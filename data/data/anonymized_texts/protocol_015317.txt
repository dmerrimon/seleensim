2/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 8:   
RATIONALE 
This amendment replaces Version 7 of Protocol GO27878.  Changes to the protocol, 
along with a rationale for each change, are summarized below:   
• Venetoclax nonclinical toxicology section updated based on recent data findings 
• Twelve month PFS was added as a secondary efficacy objective to align with 
Section 3.3.3, where it was already included as a secondary efficacy outcome 
measure (Section 2.2.2). 
• Information was added regarding the decision to not open Arm B in Phase II in 
DLBCL on the basis of information from the GOYA study results (Section 3.2.3). 
• The following inclusion/exclusion criteria were updated:   
Measurable lesions must also be FDG avid on PET to ensure the primary 
efficacy objective can be assessed and to align with other Roche/Genentech 
protocols (Section 4.1.2.3). 
Patients with discordant bone marrow (i.e., low grade histology in bone marrow) 
may be considered for the study as the outcomes are consistent with DLBCL (per published research) (Section 4.1.3.2). 
Patients with AST and ALT >
 2.5  × ULN due to disease involvement may be 
considered for the study as it is expected that lymphoma treatment will 
normalize these values (Section 4.1.3.3). 
Primary mediastinal DLBCL will be excluded as primary mediastinal DLBCL has 
different clinical and pathological features than DLBCL and standard treatment 
(Section 4.1.3.3). 
The remission duration as a prerequisite for enrolling a patient with prior 
malignancy treated with surgery only has been reduced from ≥ 5 years 
to ≥  3 years to align with other protocols for comparison (Section 4.1.3.3). 
• The recommendation for the low fat breakfast to be consumed prior to venetoclax 
dosing was modified due to new clinical pharmacology information from other 
venetoclax studies and to align with other Roche/Genentech protocols 
(Section 4.3.1.2). 
• The guideline for TLS prophylaxis was updated based on a recent analysis of 
laboratory TLS cases observed in venetoclax studies in NHL and to align with other NHL studies being conducted at Roche/Genentech (Section 4.4.1.5.1). 
• Survival Follow-up Section was added to ensure data can be collected for Overall 
Survival analyses (Section 4.5.7). 
• Post-Trial Access to study drugs section was updated to the current protocol 
template (Section 4.8). 
• The  Medical Responsible Contacts Information (Rest of World) was 
updated to reflect changes to the appointed contacts (Section 5.3.1). 

 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
3/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 • IPI score criteria was added to Appendix 7 to ensure IPI score is calculated 
accurately by site staff prior to study entry. 
• Double positive (DP) was changed to double expressor (DE) throughout the text as 
per recent update to WHO nomenclature.  
• Section 6.1 (investigator requirements) was updated to remove the exclusion from 
expedited reporting of anticipated events. 
 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.   This amendment represents cumulative 
changes to the original protocol.

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
The protocol synopsis has been updated to reflect the changes to the protocol, where 
applicable. 
SECTION 1.2.2.2:  Veneto clax Nonclinical Toxicology 
The nonclinical toxicology of venetoclax  has been evaluated in repeat dose studies of 
up to 4 weeks’ duration with once daily (QD) oral dosing and with up to 4  and 26 week 
recovery periods in mice and 26 week recov ery periods in dogs .  In addition, 
venetoclax  has been tested in  safety pharmacology studies (cardiovascular [CV], 
respiratory, and neurofunctional) and in genetic toxicity tests (Ames and in vitro 
chromosome aberrations assays).  A severely toxic dose to 10% of rodents was  not 
identified in mice up to and including the highest dose of 600  mg/kg/day (overall  mean 
area under the concentration time curve [AUC] from Time 0 to 24 hours 
[AUC 0−24] = 91.5 μg • h/mL and maximum concentration observed [C max] =  7.2 μg/mL).  In 
dogs, the highest non severely toxic dose was 150  mg/kg/day, but as a result of 
overlapping exposures between the mid  and high doses, the highest non severely toxic 
dose wa s defined as the mid dose of 50  mg/kg/day (overall mean 
AUC 0−24 = 472 μg • h/mL and C max  = 27.4 μg/mL).  
Consistent with expected pharmacological activity, venetoclax  caused moderate to 
marked decreases in lymphocytes including both T  and B cell subsets, a nd 
corresponding lymphoid depletion was obser ved in the spleen, lymph nodes, 
gutassociated lymphoid tissue (mice), and Peyer’s patches (dogs).  In dogs after 
4−6 months of recovery, B cell counts reversed non −dose dependently to 25% −111%  of 
individual bas eline (mean reversal to 54% of baseline average).  T cell subsets reversed 
more readily and showed more dose dependence in recovery time and extent.  
Additional hematological effects included reductions in red cell mass (hemoglobin,  
hematocrit) that were a dverse at 600  mg/kg/day in mice and at 150  mg/kg/day in dogs.  
In dogs, venetoclax  produced severe  decreases in the numbers of spermatogonia after 
4 weeks of dosing with progression to severe decreases in all germ cells in testes during 
the 4 week recovery period.  The translatability of the findings to humans is unknown, 
but this change may be related to venetoclax  pharmacology because one or more 
members of the Bcl 2 family of proteins play a role in spermatogenesis (Yan  et al. 2003).  
In an anesthetized do g CV model given intravenous (IV) doses of venetoclax , mild 
reductions in cardiac output ( −11% to −19%) and myocardial contractility (dP/dt max; 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
5/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 −6% to −13%) were observed at plasma concentrations of  ≥ 16 μg/mL and  ≥ 32 μg/mL 
respectively, compared with 6 dogs given vehi cle; however, no effects on blood pressure, 
heart rate, or ECG parameters we re observed in either the anesthetized dog study or 
conscious dog CV studies that used telemeterized animals.  
In an ongoing 9 month chronic toxicity study in dogs, change in the hair coat from 
normal to increased amounts of white hair was observed after 3  months of dosing at 6 or 
20 mg/kg/day (mid  and high doses, respectively).  On the basis of a similar finding of 
gray hair coat in BCL2  /− null mice, the dog hair coat change is likely to be an effect of 
Bcl2 inhibition on melanocyte stem cells, but  potential effects on patients are unknown.  
In addition, Bcl 2 in melanocytes might be involved in auditory and retinal protection, and 
inhibition of Bcl 2 by venetoclax could predispose to hearing loss or visual effects.  The 
meaning of these animal findings for humans is not known, but an event of hearing loss 
has been reported in 1  patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL) who receive d 
venetoclax.  Patients will be monitored for ocular and auditory findings.  
Other nonclinical findings in dogs included non severe, cutaneous swelling at high dose, 
post dose emesis, salivation, and fecal alterations during the dosing period.  Microscopic 
findings of single cell necrosis in the gall bladder epithelium, stomach, exocrine 
pancreas, and epididymides were considered to be an effect of Bcl 2 inhibition but were 
of minimal magnitude and not associated with loss of mucosal integrity.  
There were no  consistent effects on respiratory or neurological function, and both in vitro 
genetic toxicity test results were negative.  
Toxicology assessments completed to date with venetoclax ar e general toxicology 
studies with periods of once-daily oral dosing ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months in mice, 
from 2 weeks to 13 weeks in rats, and from 1 week to 9 weeks in dogs; in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology; embryo-fetal development in female mice and rabbits; and fertility and early embryonic development in male and female mice.  The maximum steady state venetoclax plasma exposures (mean area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]) achieved in the IND-enabling 4 week studies were 92 µg
 • h/mL (at 
600 mg/kg/day) in mice and 572 µg  • h/mL (at 150 mg/kg/day) in dogs.  In the chronic 
toxicity studies, AUCs reached 34.1 µg •h/mL (at 300 mg/kg/day) in mice and 
86 µg  • h/mL (at 20 mg/kg/day) in do gs.  In rats, exposures were higher in females than 
in males; at dosages of 150 and 400 mg/kg/ day in the 13 week maximum tolerated dose 
study, exposures ranged up to 83.1 −127.8 µg  • h/mL in females and up to 
26.4 −44.2 µg  • h/mL in males. 
The primary toxicities associated with venetoclax administration included effects on the hematologic system (decreased lymphocytes and erythrocytes) in mice, rats, and dogs; the male dog reproductive system (testicular germ cell depletion); and embryo-fetal toxicity in mice. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
6/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 In mice, rats, and dogs, venetoclax produced generally dose-related decreases in 
lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (of up to 75% in mice, up to 64% in rats, and up to 81% in dogs) and in lymphoid tissues.  In dogs, the recovery of lymphocyte counts (total lymphocytes, CD4
 + and CD8  + T cells and mature B cells) was prolonged, 
requiring up to 18 weeks after completion of 2 weeks of dosing.  B cells were the most sensitive lymphocyte subtype based on the magnitude of decrease and/or the length of time required for recovery (i.e., 25%
−111% of individual baseline; mean reversal to 
54% of baseline average).  T-cell subsets reversed more readily and showed more dose-dependence in recovery time and extent.  Decreases of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues were reversible in mice and rever sible to partially reversible in dogs.  
Venetoclax-related decreases in lymphocy tes in blood and lymphoid tissues are 
considered pharmacologically-mediated and non-adverse (Marsden and Strasser, 2003). 
In the 4 week mouse and dog studies, dose-related reversible decreases in RBC mass 
were observed.  Effects on RBC mass were typified by hemoglobin decreases.  At the 
highest dosages administered, decreases in hemoglobin reached -21% in mice at 600 mg/kg/day and -23% in dogs at 150 mg/kg/ day, and were considered to be adverse 
based on a criterion of -20% decrease.  In rats, decreases in hemoglobin were more severe than in mice and dogs at comparable exposures and reached 30% to 49% at 
≥ 150 mg/kg/day in females.  Hematologic parameters (lymphocyte counts and RBC 
mass) are readily monitored in clinical trial subjects. 
In dogs, venetoclax produced adverse, non-reversible, non −dose-related microscopic 
findings of testicular germ cell depletion at all dosages tested; there were no testicular 
effects in mice.  The translatability of the testicular findings in dogs to humans is 
unknown, but this change may be related to venetoclax pharmacology, as one or more members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins play a role in spermatogenesis (Olderied et al. 2001; Sugiyama et al. 2001; Ya n et al. 2003).  No effects of venetoclax 
have been identified in female reproductive tissues in mice or dogs in general toxicology studies. 
Venetoclax resulted in increased post-implantation loss and decreased fetal body 
weights in the mouse embryo-fetal development study at the highest dosage administered (150 mg/kg/day); the no-observed -adverse-effect level was defined at the 
mid-dose of 50 mg/kg/day.  Venetoclax was not teratogenic, and there were no other 
effects on development or fertility. 
Additional noteworthy effects of venetoclax included white hair coat discoloration in 
dogs (occurring after approxim ately 3 months of dosing in the 9 month study) and 
single cell necrosis in various epithelial tissues (gallbladder, exocrine pancreas, stomach, exocrine pancreas, and epididymides) in dogs.  Single cell necrosis was minimal except for non
−dose-dependent minimal to mild single cell necrosis in the 
pylorus of the stomach at ≥ 2 mg/kg/day in the 9 month stu dy.  After 4 weeks of dosing 
and a 4 week recovery period, reversibility was observed in the gallbladder and exocrine 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
7/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 pancreas, but minimal single cell necrosis was still present in the epididymides and 
prostate (potentially related to the testicular effects) and in the stomach.  Single cell 
necrosis was considered not to be adverse due to its minimal to mild magnitude and because no loss of mucosal integrity was observed histopathologically.  The hair coat change correlated histopathologically with decreased pigment in hair follicle bulbs, and is consistent with the pharmacologic inhibition of Bcl-2 by venetoclax, leading to Bcl-2 functional loss in hair follicle melanocytes dependent on Bcl-2 for survival (Yamamura et al. 1996)  A dedicated physical  examination of the skin and extensive 
ophthalmic examinations determined that pigmentation of the skin and in the eye (particularly, the iris and fundus) of the dog appeared unaffected.  This was confirmed by the absence of associated histopathologic findings in skin (other than in hair follicles) and in the eye.  Consequently, white hair coat discoloration was considered non-adverse; reversibility has not been assessed. 
Minor effects of venetoclax were:  mild, dose-related, transient post-dose emesis, 
increased salivation, and fecal alterations (unformed or watery feces); minimally increased pigment in Kupffer cells and macrophages in the liver and gallbladder, respectively; and clinical signs of skin swelling, all in dogs.  With regard to the latter finding, dogs at the high dosage of 150 mg/kg/day in the 4 week study had clinical signs of swelling of the skin on the ears, head (cranial area), and forepaws and/or hindpaws.  Most but not all animals (8 of 10 dogs) were affected, and in three dogs the swelling reaction was observed after the first dose.  The clinical signs were transient and sporadic in occurrence, and were absent during the recovery period.  A mechanistic basis for the swelling reactions was not establis hed, but the clinical signs were mild to 
moderate in severity and re versible, and there were no signs of anaphylaxis. 
There was no evidence of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity of venetoclax, nor was there evidence of phototoxicity. 
Venetoclax was tested in a battery of safety pharmacology assays, and produced no 
effects in the CNS/neurobehavioral or respiratory studies in mice at oral doses up to and including the highest oral dose of 600 mg/k g.  No effects on QTc were observed up 
to a maximum plasma concentration of 46 μg/mL in dogs.  In conscious dogs, 
venetoclax did not produce any cardiovascular effects up to and including the highest oral dose of 150 mg/kg (maximum  concentration observed [Cmax]
 = 16 μg/mL).  In the 
anesthetized dog at higher plasma concentrations, venetoclax produced mild reductions in myocardial contractility (-6% to -13% ) and cardiac output (-11% to -19%) at 
plasma concentrations of 
≥ 16 μg/mL and ≥ 32 μg/mL, respectively.  These 
concentrations are greater than the plasma concentration of venetoclax in humans (average Cmax
 = 6.09 μg/mL at the 1200 mg/day dose).

8/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 SECTION 2.1:  PRIMARY OBJECTIVES 
The primary objectives of the Phase II portion of the study are the following: 
• To make a preliminary assessment of efficacy as measured by CR rate at end of 
treatment determined by positron emission tomography and/or computed 
tomography (PET-CT) scans (see Appendix 2) of the combination of venetoclax and 
R-CHOP administered to patients with previously untreated DLBCL 
• To make an assessment of efficacy, as measured by CR rates at end of treatment 
determined by PET-CT scans, of the combination of venetoclax and R-CHOP 
administered to patients with previously untreated DLBCL co-expressing both Bcl-2 
and c-Myc proteins (i.e., DP DE-DLBCL) 
 
SECTION 2.2.2:  Seconda ry Efficacy Objective  
The secondary efficacy objectives of this study include the following: 
• To make a preliminary assessment of efficacy when venetoclax and R-CHOP are 
administered in combination to patients with previously untreated DLBCL, as 
measured by: 
OR rate 
CR rate as determined by CT scan 
Response duration DOR  
PFS  
12 month PFS estimate  
 
SECTION 3.1:  DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
After the first 20  patients in the R CHOP arm o f the Phase  For the Phase II R-CHOP 
arm portion  of the study , after the first 20 patients have completed Cycles 1 and 2 of 
study treatment, the Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC) and Scientific Oversight 
Committee (SOC; see Section 3.1.1) will meet to review safety data for all patients treated in both the Phase Ib and Phase II portions of the study in order to confirm the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy at the venetoclax dose chosen at the end of Phase Ib.  
SECTION 3.1.1:  Internal Monitori ng Committee and Scie ntific Oversight 
Committee  
The study will enroll approximately 24 −4860 patients during the dose-finding stage and 
approximately 180 −200 patients in the Phase II portion at approximately 69 investigative 
sites in North America, the European Union, and Asia Pacific. 
SECTION 3.1.2:  Phase Ib:  Dose-Finding  
Each study arm (R-CHOP in Arm A or G-CHOP in Arm B) will have up to four 
dose-finding cohorts exploring venetoclax doses and dosing schedule ranging from 
200 to 800 mg.  with a maximum dosing e administration schedules  of a maximum 10 
days per cycle.    
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
9/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 SECTION 3.1.2.1:  Cohort Dosing Regimen 
Cycle 1 
• Oral dosing of venetoclax will then continue through Day 10 of Cycle 1 and 
Days 1-10 of Cycles 2 through 8.   or alternative dose administration schedules, 
that include oral administration of venetoclax on Days 4 −8 in Cycle 1 and Days 
1−5 in Cycles 2 −8. 
SECTION 3.1.2.2:  Dose Escalation Guidelines 
Dosing with venetoclax will begin on Day 4 of Cycle 1 (or 3 days after the first CHOP 
dose, see Section 3.1.2.1) and continue to be administered daily through Day  8 
or Day  10 of Cycle 1 and then on  Days 1 −5 or Days 1 −10 for Cycles 2 −8 for up to 
eight 21-day cycles of combination therapy with R-CHOP or G-CHOP. 
If the administration of venetoclax results in unacceptable toxicity on Days 4 −10 of 
Cycle 1 and Days 1− 10 of Cycles 2-8 schedule or other proposed alternative dose 
administration schedules then alternative dose regimens of venetoclax (e.g., venetoclax 
administered on Days 1–3 or 1–7 of 21) or lower doses of venetoclax may be substituted 
in subsequent cohorts. 
SECTION 3.1.3:  Phase II: Expansion  
Because effects of Bcl-2 inhibition may differ depending on both the level of Bcl-2 expression and the molecular milieu (see Section 1.3), activity of the combination will be explored in specific molecular subsets, including Bcl-2 high, Bcl-2 low, 
Bcl-2- overexpression and c-Myc overexpression (DP
E), and GCB and ABC subtypes of 
DLBCL. 
Enrollment into the R-CHOP cohort of patients with both Bcl-2 high and Bcl-2 low 
DLBCL will continue until approximately 50 patients with DP DE-DLBCL (approximately 
160− 200 patients total; see Section 4.10.6 .  Patients with Bcl 2 low/negative and 
cMyc low DLBCL will be included and ABC versus GCB subset analysis will be 
performe d, but enrollment numbers will not be gated to these groups.  Enrollment into 
the G CHOP cohort will continue until at least 20 patients have been enrolled.   
Thereafter, patients will be followed in the clinic every 3 months for safety and disease assessments for up to 2 years after the last patient is enrolled
 has completed  treatment 
or until death or study termination, whichever occurs first. 
SECTION 3.1.4:  Discontinuation of  Venetoclax plus R-CHOP or G-CHOP  
Patients who discontinue venetoclax plus R-CHOP or venetoclax plus G-CHOP for 
reasons other than PD should remain in the study have a documented response 
assessment and  continue to be followed until disease progression or even after institution 
of alternative therapy.  They se patients  should continue with follow-up visits every 
3 months to collect information on disease progression,  and /or  initiation of an 
alternative lymphoma therapy, and .  After PD, patients will also continue to be followed 
for OS yearly (see Section 4.5.5). 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
10/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 SECTION 3.2.3:  Rationale for Vene toclax Dose Selection in the Phase II 
Portion of the Study  
On 17 July 2016, Roche/Genentech as th e sponsor of Study BO21005 (Goya study), a 
Phase III study that evaluated G CHOP versus R-CHOP in 1L DLBCL, informed 
through a press release that the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS was not 
met.  Given these results, Arm B (venetoclax  + G-CHOP) will not be expanded in Phase 
II in patients who are first-line with DLBCL. 
SECTION 3.2.9:  Rationale for Coll ecting Tumor Biopsies and Peripheral 
Blood for Biomarker Studies  
The following samples will be collected to enable the evaluation of the parameters listed above: 
• A
An FFPE tumor biopsy sample must be collected at disease progression and sent 
to the central laboratory to evaluate venetoclax resistance mechanisms.   The 
sample must be a tissue block or 20 unstained serial slides.  
 
SECTION 3.4.1.1:  Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Hospitalization will be required at initial venetoclax dosing for patients who are 
determined to be at high risk of TLS as a result of bulky disease (i.e., any lymphoma 
mass  ≥ 10 cm  and/or evidence of circulating lymphoma cells ).   
SECTION 3.4.2.1.1:  Management of  Severe Infusion-Related Reactions 
Patients who require close monitoring during the first and all subsequent infusions 
include patients with preexisting cardiac and pulmonary conditions, patients with prior clinically significant cardiopulmonary adver se events, and patients with high numbers of 
circulating malignant cells ( ≥
 25,000 cells /μL) with or without evidence of high tumor 
burden. 
SECTION 3.4.2.2:  Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
The risks of TLS appear to be greater in patients with high numbers of circulating 
malignant cells ( ≥ 25,000 cells /μL) or high tumor burden. 
SECTION 4.1.2.3:  All Patients 
Patients must meet the following criteria for study entry: 
• At least one bi-dimensionally measurable lymphoma lesion on CT scan defined as 
> 1.5 cm in its longest dimension, which is also FDG avid by screening PET scan.  
• Adequate hematologic function (unless caused by underlying disease, as 
established by extensive bone marrow involvem ent or as a result of hypersplenism 
secondary to the involvement of the sp leen by lymphoma per the investigator) 
defined as follows: 
Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL 
Absolute neutrophil count ANC  ≥ 1.5  × 109/L 
 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
11/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 SECTION 4.1.3.2:  Patients Enrolled in the Phase II Portion of the Study 
Patients who meet any of the following cr iteria will be excluded from study entry: 
• Patients with transformed lymphoma  (patients with discordant bone marrow 
involvement(i.e., low grade histology in bone marrow) may be considered after 
discussion with the Medical Monitor)  
 
SECTION 4.1.3.3:  All Patients 
Patients who meet any of the following cr iteria will be excluded from study entry: 
• CNS lymphoma  or primary mediastinal DLBCL  
• History of other malignancy that could affect compliance with the protocol or 
interpretation of results 
Patients with a malignancy that has been treated with surgery alone with 
curative intent will also be excluded, unless the malignancy has been in 
documented remission without treatment for ≥ 53 years prior to enrollment. 
• Received the following agents within 7 days prior to the first dose of venetoclax: 
Steroid therapy for anti-neoplastic intent within 7 days prior to the first dose of 
study drug. Cycle 1 Day 1.  See steroid use guidelines in Section 4.4.1 for 
specific exceptions. 
• Any of the following abnormal laboratory values: 
AST or ALT > 2.5  × ULN (unless due to disease involvement; Medical Monitor to 
be consulted prior to enrollment) 
 
SECTION 4.3.1.2:  Dosage, Administration, and Storage  
Each dose of venetoclax will be taken with approximately 240 mL of water within 30 
minutes after the completion of a low fat breakfast or the patient's first meal of the day.  
A meal containing approximately 30% of the total caloric content from fat is recommended to ensure adequate absorption of venetoclax.  On days that pre-dose PK 
sampling is required, the patient’s first meal of the day (e.g., breakfast) will be 
consumed in the morning at the clinic, and venetoclax dosing will occur in the 
morning
clinic  after the completion of a low fat breakfast  the meal  or the patient's first 
meal of the day at the clinic  to facilitate PK sampling.  Examples of a low fat breakfast 
include 2 slices of white toast with 1 tablespoon of low fat margarine and 1 tablespoon of 
jelly and 8 ounces of skim milk (319 calories and 8.2 g fat) or 1 cup of cereal, 8 ounces 
of skim milk, 1 slice of toast with jam, apple juice, and 1 cup of coffee or tea (520 
calories and 2 g fat).  
The recommended breakfast is as follows:   
1 box cereal (30–40 g) 
Skim milk (240 mL) 1 boiled egg 
1 slice toast (15 g) 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
12/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Margarine (10 g)  
 
Total calories should be approximately 520 Kcal; 30% of the total caloric content of the 
meal is from fat. Total grams of fat should be approximately 17 grams.

IgE-mediated allergic reactions, which should be managed as directed in Section 4.4.1.6.  
b Supportive treatment:  Patients should be tr eated with acetaminophen and an antihistamine 
such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride if they have not been received in the previous 
4 hours.  IV saline may be indicated.  For bron chospasm, urticaria, or dyspnea, patients may 
require antihistamines, oxygen, corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg of IV prednisolone or equivalent), and/or bronchodilators.  For hypot ension, patients may require vasopressors. 
 
SECTION 4.3.5:  Administration of Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor  
All patients must receive G-CSF as primary prophylaxis for neutropenia starting with 
Cycle 1 and continuing through each additional cycle of study CHOP  therapy received.

Steroid use not otherwise dictated by the protocol CHOP treatment will follow the 
guidelines outlined below: 
• Corticosteroid use  > 30 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent:  Not allowed within 
7 days prior to first dose Cycle 1 Day 1  except as specified below 
 
SECTION 4.4.1.3:  Treatment and Prophylaxis of Neutropenia 
G-CSF should be administered as primary prophylaxis starting with Cycle 1 of therapy  
and continue through each cycle of CHOP therapy received  for all patients unless there 
is a medical contraindication or the investigator feels it is not in the patient’s best interest 
to receive G-CSF.

13/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 SECTION 4.4.1.5:  Prophylaxi s for Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
TLS is a risk for patients with NHL who are treated with high cell-killing agents.  The risk 
of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors that include tumor burden and 
comorbidities.  Risk is highest for those with bulky disease, elevated absolute 
lymphocyte count, elevated pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase  (LDH)  levels, elevated 
leukocyte count, compromised renal function, and dehydration.  Patients  All patients 
should undergo tumor burden assessment with bulky disease, defined as any lymph 
node ≥ 8 cm on the screening CT scan, and/or lymphocytosis due to circulating 
lymphoma cells, are considered at higher risk of TLS and must be hospitalized for more 
intensive monitoring during the initial dose , CBC with WBC differential, and blood 
chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine).  Pre-existing chemistry abnormalities should be corrected prior to initiation  of treatment with 
venetoclax.   
SECTION 4.4.1.5.1:  Hospitalization 
Patients exhibiting specific characteristics at high erscreening or initiation of venetoclax 
treatment are considered to be at high  risk for development of  TLS ( and must be 
hospitalized for more intensive pr ophylaxis and monitored during for the initial dose of 
venetoclax.  These patients are identified by the presence of any of the following:    
• Any lymph node ≥ 8mass ≥  10 cm and/or on the screening CT scan 
• Circulating lymphoma cells) must be hospitalized for the initial dose of venetoclax.  
defined by o Out-of-range (high) absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) or the presence 
of abnormal cells in the peripheral bl ood differential sign ifying circulating 
lymphoma cells 
 
In addition to characteristics requiring mandatory hospitalization, other patient 
characteristics may suggest an increased risk  of TLS.  These include but are not limited 
to the following:   
• Overall disease burden (e.g., several enlarged lymph nodes, even if none reaching 
10 cm) 
• Elevated LDH levels 
• Compromised renal function, as evidenced by low CRCL 
• Extensive bone marrow involvement 
• Dehydration  
 
Hospitalization should also be considered is not mandatory for patients who exhibit 
these characteristics, but these and any other factors that are considered relevant to 
TLS should be considered in the overall asse ssment of the patient’s state and their risk 
to develop TLS.  Investigators should use their judgment in their assessment of the patient’s risk of TLS development and may choose to hospitalize any patient they consider to be at risk for the development of TLS during the first dose of venetoclax,

the Medical Monitor.  
SECTION 4.4.1.8:  Other Concomitant Medications 
G-CSF will be administered as primary prophylaxis in each cycle of CHOP  therapy (see 
Section 4.4.1.3).  
SECTION 4.4.2:  Excluded Therapy  
Table 4 Excluded and Ca utionary Medications 
Excluded Medications 
Anti-cancer therapies including chemotherapy, r adiotherapy, or other investigational therapy, 
including targeted small molecule agents: 
Excluded 5 half lives28 days  prior to first dose and throughout venetoclax 
administration.  
Biologic agents (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) for anti-neoplastic intent: 
Excluded 8 weeks prior to first dose and throughout venetoclax administration 
Grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including marmalade containing 
Seville oranges) or star fruit: 
Excluded 3 days prior to first dose and throughout venetoclax administration 
 
SECTION 4.5.1.4:  Tumor and Response Evaluation 
All measurable disease must be documented at screening by a Diagnostic quality CT 
scan and a combined PET-CT scan  with a diagnostic quality CT component.  and 
reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.   Response assessments will be 
determined by the investigator on the basis of imaging studies and bone marrow 
examinations (if appropriate), with the use of the modified Lugano Classification  
(Cheson et al. 2014; see Appendix 2).  A five-point scale score is required as part of the 
PET scan response.   
Patients will be evaluated for disease respons e by PET-CT imaging after Cycle 4 and at 
6 to 8 weeks after Day 1 of Cycle 8 or last cycle received .  A bone marrow examination 
must be repeated only to confirm a CR if it was previously positive , if it was not 
performed, or if it was indeterminate at screening. 
Diagnostic-quality CT scan with use of oral and IV contrast (unless medically 
contraindicated) must be obtained at baseline , after Cycle 4  and at end of treatment 
evaluation (6 to 8 weeks after Day 1 of Cycle 8  or last cycle received ).  If PET-CT with 
diagnostic CT is not obtainable, a separate diagnostic CT scan must be performed at 
these two timepoints in addition to the PET scans. 
CT scans (with oral and IV contrast, unless medically contraindicated) will be performed 
every 6 months for 2 years and as clinically indicated  during these follow ups .  If a 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
15/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 patient exhibits clinical signs of possible disease progression (i.e., increased or de novo 
enlargement of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on physical examination), additional 
assessments including PET-CT or contrast-enhanced CT scan and/or bone marrow 
must be performed to evaluate for PD . 
CT scans (with contrast) should include chest, abdomen, and pelvis scans; CT scans of the neck should be included if clinically indicated  (MRIs may be used instead of CT 
scans in patients for whom CT scans are contraindicated) .  CT scans for response 
assessment may be limited to areas of prior involvement only if required by local 
regulatory authorities.  Provision will be made to collect and store the CT scans should a 
radiology review be required in the future.  
Bone marrow examinations should include biopsy and/or aspirate for morphology and 
flow cytometry and are required at screening.  If positive or indeterminate at screening, 
a subsequent bone marrow examination is r equired only to confirm a CR . 
SECTION 4.5.1.5.1:  Cent ral Laboratory Assessments 
• PK assays 
Serum samples will be obtained for measurement of rituximab or 
obinutuzumab concentrations and EDTA-anticoagulated; plasma samples will 
be obtained for measurement of venetoclax or CHOP concentrations at 
timepoints noted in Appendix 3.   The  samples  will be sent to the central 
laboratory  and then to a Sponsor designated bioanalytical laboratory or to the 
Sponsor or  designee for analysis.   Relevant biotransformation products of 
study treatment may also be analyzed at the discretion of the Sponsor. 
 
SECTION 4.5.2:  Screening and Pretreatment Assessments  
Results of standard-of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed 
consent and within 21 days prior to first dose of study drug may be used (bone marrow examination could have been performed up to 3 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, if the 
laboratory report is available and if the tumor biopsy sample can be obtained from initial 
diagnosis ); such tests do not need to be repeated for screening. 
SECTION 4.5.6:  Follow-Up Assessments  
Patients will be followed for response until disease progression, death, initiation of 
another NHL therapy , or study closure, whichever occurs first.  Study closure will occur 
approximately 2 year s after the last patient has been enrolled.  
SECTION 4.5.7:  Survival Follow-Up Assessments  
Survival follow-up information will be collected via telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or clinic visits approximately every 6 months until death, lost to follow-up, consent withdrawal, or study termination by Roche, whichever occurs first.  All patients will be followed for survival and new anti-lymphoma therapy information unless the patient requests to be withdrawn from follow-up (this request must be 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
16/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 documented in the source documents and signed  by the investigator),  is lost to follow-
up, dies, or the study is terminated by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.  If the 
patient withdraws from the study, the study staff may use a public information source (e.g., county records) to obtain information about survival status only if permitted per local regulations. 
Study closure will occur approximately 2 years after the last patient has completed 
treatment. 
SECTION 4.8:  POST-STUDY ACCESS TO VENETOCLAX, 
OBINUTUZUMAB, AND RITUXIMAB  
Continued access to venetoclax, CHOP, rituximab, and/or obinutuzumab is not 
guaranteed after the end of the study.  After the patient’s participation in the study ends, 
the patient or the patient’s health plan will n eed to pay for medicines and clinic, hospital, 
and doctors’ services that are part of the patient’s regular medical care.  
The Sponsor will offer post-study access to the study drug (venetoclax, obinutuzumab, and rituximab) free of charge to eligible patients in accordance with the Roche Global Policy on Continued Access to Investigatio nal Medicinal Product, as outlined below. 
A patient will be eligible to receive stud y drug after completing the study if all
 of the 
following conditions are met: 
• The patient has a life-threatening or severe medical condition and requires 
continued study drug treatment for his or her well-being  
• There are no appropriate alternative treatments available to the patient 
• The patient and his or her doctor comply with and satisfy any legal or regulatory 
requirements that apply to them 
 
A patient will not  be eligible to receive study drug after completing the study if any  of 
the following conditions are met: 
• The study drug is commercially marketed in the patient's country and is 
reasonably accessible to the patient (e.g., is covered by the patient's insurance or wouldn't otherwise create a financial hardship for the patient) 
• The Sponsor has discontinued development of the study drug or data suggest that 
the study drug is not effective for NHL/DLBCL 
• The Sponsor has reasonable safety concerns regarding the study drug as treatment for NHL/DLBCL  
• Provision of study drug is not permitted under the laws and regulations of the 
patient's country

17/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 SECTION 4.10.4.1:  Tumor Assessment Data 
ITT population and All patients in the extension cohort who receive any amount of 
venetoclax or R-CHOP/G-CHOP will be included in the activity analysis. 
SECTION 4.10.4.2:  Interim Analyses 
An extension of the  predictive probability design (Lee and Liu 2008) will be used to guide 
stopping by comparing CR rates in the venetoclax  + R-CHOP arm with historical controls 
using R-CHOP.   
SECTION 4.10.6:  Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of 20 for the G CHOP  + venetoclax Arm in the Phase II portion is 
expected to be sufficient to obtain a preliminary estimate of the per centage of patients 
with compromised chemotherapy dose intensity.  
SECTION 5.1:  SAFETY PARAMETERS AND DEFINITIONS 
Safety assessments will consist of monito ring and recording adverse events including 
serious adverse events, selected adverse events upon emer ging data,  and adverse 
events of special interest, measurement of protocol-specified safety laboratory 
assessments, measurement of protocol-specified vital signs, and other 
protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. 
SECTION 5.1.2:  Serious Adverse E vent (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)  
“Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient or event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that  pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital 
functions.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor 
immediately via the Adverse Event eCRF (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section 5.3.2 for reporting instructions). 
SECTION 5.1.3:  Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately 
Reportable to the Sponsor)  
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately via the Adverse Event eCRF (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event; see Section 5.3.2 for reporting instructions).   
SECTION 5.2.1:  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
After this period, the investigator should report any deaths, serious adverse events or 
adverse events of special interest that are believed to be related to prior study drug 
treatment (see Section 5.5).  
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
19/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 investigators (see "Protocol Administrative and Contact Information & List of 
Investigators").   
SECTION 5.5:  POST-STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS 
At the time of study treatment  completion or study treatment  discontinuation, the 
investigator should instruct each patient to report to the investigator any subsequent adverse events that the patient’s personal physician believes could be related to prior study drug treatment or study procedures.   
The investigator should report these events directly to Roche Safety Risk Management 
via telephone or via fax machine or scanned and emailed with the use the Serious 
Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form and fax cover sheet 
(see "Protocol Administrative and Contact Information & List of Investigators"). 
SECTION 5.6:  EXPEDITED REPORT ING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES, 
INVESTIGATORS, INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS, AND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES 
Certain adverse events (e.g., known consequences of the underlying disease or 
common co morbidities in the study population) ar e anticipated to occur in the study 
population at some frequency independent of drug exposure and will be excluded from 
expedited reporting.  A list of such anticipated events will be provided to drug safety 
operations and to health authorities upon reques t.   
Although exempted from expedited reporting to  certain health authorities and IRBs/ECs 
as individual cases, these Serious Adverse Events must be reported to the Sponsors 
within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event as defin ed in 
Section  5.3.2 .

APPENDIX 1:  Schedule of Assessments 
The Schedule of Assessments has been revised to reflect the changes to the protocol. 
APPENDIX 2:  The Modified Lugano Clas sification:  Revised Criteria for 
Response Assessment 
The Lugano Classification described by Cheson (2014), is presented in the Revised Criteria for Response Assessment table with the following modifications:  (1) For 
complete response (CR), if the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma or 
indeterminate prior to treatment, the infiltrate must have cleared on repeat bone marrow 
biopsy; (2) For PET-CT-based partial response (PR), CT criteria for PR (or CR) must 
also be met. 
The table in Appendix 2 was updated to reflect these modifications.

Lymphoma  
Stage I Involvement of a single lymph node  region (I) or of a single extralymphatic 
organ or site (IE) a 
Stage II Involvement of two or more lymph node regions or lymphatic structures on the 
same side of the diaphragm alone (II) or with involvement of limited, contiguous 
extralymphatic organ or tissue (IIE) 
Stage III Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm (III) which 
may include the spleen (IIIS) or limited, co ntiguous extralymphatic organ or site 
(IIIE), or both (IIIES) 
Stage IV Diffuse or disseminated foci of invo lvement of one or more extralymphatic organs 
or tissues, with or without associated lymphatic involvement 
a The designation “E” generally refers to extranodal contiguous extension (i.e., proximal 
or contiguous extranodal disease) that can be encompassed within an irradiation field 
appropriate for nodal disease of the same anatom ic extent.  A single extralymphatic site as 
the only site of disease  should be classified as IE, rather than Stage IV.  
All cases are subclassified to indicate the absence (A) or presence (B) of the 
systemic (“B”) symptoms  of significant unexplained fever ( > 38˚C), night sweats, or 
unexplained weight loss exceeding 10% of body weight during the 6 months prior to 
diagnosis.   
Clinical stage refers to the extent of disease  determined by diagnostic tests following a 
single diagnostic biopsy.  If a second biopsy of any kind is obtained, even if negative, 
the term pathologic stage is used.

Study Design  
Description of Study 
This is a Phase Ib/II, multicenter, open-label, do se-finding study of v enetoclax administered 
orally in combination with rituximab or obi nutuzumab and standard doses of CHOP in patients 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
34/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 with NHL.  The study will consist of two stage s:  a dose-finding Phase Ib stage and a Phase II 
expansion stage.  In the Phase I portion of the study, two parallel treatment arms will explore 
doses of venetoclax ranging from 200 to 800 mg  administered in combination with R-CHOP and 
G-CHOP.  Patients will be treated for a total of eight cycles (six cycles of CHOP and eight 
cycles of venetoclax  + rituximab or venetoclax  + obinutuzumab).  Each cycle will consist 
of 21 days.  Patients who experience ongoing res ponse without excessive toxicity may receive 
up to eight cycles of CHOP following discussion between the investigator and the Medical 
Monitor.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of  venetoclax in combination with R-CHOP and 
G-CHOP will be determined sepa rately for each arm during the dose-findi ng stage.   
The dose and dose schedule for venetoclax for each arm determined in Phase I will be used in the Phase II expansion stage for that arm. 
For the Phase II portion of the study, the venetoclax dose for Arm A is 800 mg on a 
non-continuous dosing schedule of Cycle 1 Days 4 −10 and Cycles 2 −8 Days 1 −10, as 
determined by the Phase Ib portion of the study based on safety and tolerability observed in 
patients treated in the dose es calation portion of the study.   
If there are concerns about the tolerability of the Phase II dose at any time during the Phase II 
study, a lower dose or an alternat ive dosing schedule for venetoclax
 + R-CHOP or G-CHOP 
may be explored on a case by case basis based on the guideline.  
For the Phase II R-CHOP arm  of the study , after the first 20 patients  have completed Cycles 1 
and 2 of study treatment, the Internal Monito ring Committee (IMC) and Scientific Oversight 
Committee (SOC) will meet to review safety data for all patients treated in both the Phase Ib 
and Phase II portions of the study in order to confirm the safety and tolerability of the 
combination therapy at the venetoclax dose chos en at the end of Phase Ib.  Enrollment will 
continue while the interim safety analysis is being conducted.   
On the basis of this review, changes may be made to the dose or the dosing schedule of the 
Phase II.  
Number of Patients 
The study will enroll approximately 24 −60 patients during the dose-finding stage and 
approximately 180 −200 patients in the Phase II portion at approximately 69 investigative sites in 
North America, the European Union, and Asia Pacific.

Investigational Medicinal Products  
The Investigational Medicinal Products used in this study are venetoclax, rituximab, and 
obinutuzumab (GA101).  
 
Venetoclax 
The venetoclax tablets will be packaged in high-density polyethylene plastic bottles to 
accommodate the study design.  Each bottle will be labeled per local regulatory requirements.  
A desiccant canister may be included in the bottle.  The tablets must be stored at 15 °C−25°C 
(59°F−77°F).  If supplied with a desiccant, the desiccant canister should be returned to the 
bottle directly after each tablet removal. 
Study patients will self-administer venetoclax tablets by mouth once daily (QD).  Each dose of 
venetoclax will be taken with approximately 240 mL of water within 30 minutes after the 
completion of breakfast or the patient's first meal of the day.  A meal containing approximately 
30% of the total caloric content from fat is recommended to ensure adequate absorption of 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
39/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 venetoclax.  On days that pre-dose PK sampling is required, the patient’s first meal of the day 
(e.g., breakfast) will be consumed in the morning at the clinic, and venetoclax dosing will 
occur in the clinic  after completion the meal  to facilitate PK sampling. 
On days when venetoclax plus R-CHOP or G-CH OP are given, the order of study treatment 
administration will be venetoclax prior to rituximab or obinutuzumab, and rituximab or 
obinutuzumab prior to CHOP (with the exception of  the first dose of prednisone in each cycle).  
On days when both venetoclax and prednisone ar e given, venetoclax will be taken prior to 
prednisone.  If vomiting occurs within 15 minutes after taking venetoclax and all expelled tablets are still intact, another dose may be given and the second dose noted in the drug log.  
Otherwise, no replacement dose is to be given.  In cases where a dose of venetoclax is missed 
or forgotten, the patient should take the dose as  soon as possible and ensure that the minimal 
interval between the current dose and the next dose is at least 16 hours in order to avoid 
excessive drug accumulation after the next dose.  Patients will be instructed to record the date 
and time they take their daily dose of venetocla x and prednisone.  Diaries will be provided by 
the Sponsor for this purpose.  Venetoclax must be stored according to labeled storage 
conditions. 
All patients must receive prophylaxis for TLS prior to the initiation of venetoclax plus R-CHOP or 
G-CHOP study treatment. 
Rituximab 
Rituximab (Rituxan®/MabThera®) is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free liquid 
concentrate for intravenous (IV) administration.  Rituximab is supplied at a concentration of 
10 mg/mL in 100-mg (10 mL) and 500-mg (50 mL) si ngle-use vials.  The product is formulated 
for IV administration in 9.0 mg/mL sodium chlo ride, 7.35 mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, and 
0.7 mg/mL polysorbate 80, after reconstitution wi th Sterile Water for Injection.  The pH is 
adjusted to 6.5.  Vials are for single use.  Each vial and carton will contain a label (either 
single-panel or booklet) affixed to the vial or  carton per individual country requirements. 
Rituximab will be administered intravenously once per 21-day cycle in combination with CHOP for up to six cycles and as a single agent for two additional cycles.  Patients who experience ongoing response without excessive toxicity may re ceive up to eight cycles of CHOP following 
discussion between the investigator and the Medical Monitor.  The infusion of 375 mg/m
2 will be 
based on the patient’s body surface area ( BSA) at screening and will remain the same 
throughout the study unless there is a > 10% change in body weight.  On a given day, rituximab 
should be given after venetoclax and prior to CH OP (with the exception of the first dose of 
prednisone in each cycle). 
Rituximab should not be administered as an IV push or bolus.  IRRs may occur.  Premedication 
consisting of acetaminophen, diphenhydramine (or other suitable antihistamine), and a single 
dose of hydrocortisone (up to 100 mg or an equivalent dose of methylprednisolone) may also be administered beginning with the first infusion.  Premedication may attenuate IRRs.  Because 
transient hypotension may occur during rituxi mab infusion, consideration should be given to 
withholding antihypertensive medications for 12 hours prior to rituximab infusion. 
There will be no rituximab dose modification in this  study.  Patients who are at high risk for IRR 
or TLS complications may, at the investigator’s di scretion, receive their initial dose of rituximab 
split over 2 consecutive days (e.g., 125 mg/m2 on Cycle 1 Day 1, 250 mg/m2 on Cycle 1 Day 2). 
If the patient tolerates the first infusion well, subsequent rituximab infusions may be 
administered at an initial rate of 100 mg/hr and in creased in 100-mg/hr increments at 30-minute 
intervals to a maximum of 400 mg/hr, as tolerat ed or per an institution’s standard of care IV 
administration procedure. 
Any NCI CTCAE v4.0 toxicity Grade ≥ 3 in severity that is deemed related to rituximab treatment 
will require interruption of study treatment until resolution to Grade ≤ 1.  Resumption of rituximab 
treatment may be considered in patients with resolution of toxicities to Grade ≤ 2 within 3 weeks 
at the discretion of the investigator after consulta tion with the study Medical Monitor.  Failure of 
such toxicities to resolve a fter 3 weeks of suspen ded study treatment w ill require permanent 
discontinuation of rituximab. Patients who discontinue rituximab because of ritu ximab-related toxicity may continue to receive 
CHOP and/or venetoclax only after consultation by the investigator with the Medical Monitor. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
40/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Obinutuzumab 
Obinutuzumab is provided as a single-dose, sterile liquid formulation in a 50 mL 
pharmaceutical-grade glass vial containing a nomin al 1000 mg of obinutuzumab (G3 material).  
The formulated drug product consists of 25 mg/mL drug substance (G3) formulated in histidine, 
trehalose, and poloxamer 188.  The vial contains 41 mL (with 2.5% overfill). 
The recommended storage conditions for t he obinutuzumab drug product are between 2 °C and 
8°C and protect from light.  Chem ical and physical in-use stabilit y for obinutuzumab dilutions in 
0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) has b een demonstrated for 24 hours at 2 °C−8°C and at ambient 
temperature and ambient room lighting.  T he prepared diluted product should be used 
immediately.  If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C−8°C.  
Obinutuzumab should not be frozen or shaken.  Mix gently.  All transfer procedures require 
strict compliance with aseptic techniques.  Do not use an additional in-line filter; this will avoid 
potential adsorption. Obinutuzumab will be administered by IV infusi on as an absolute (flat) dose of 1000 mg in 
combination with CHOP for up to six cycles and as a single agent for two additional cycles.  
Patients who experience ongoing response wit hout excessive toxicity may receive up to 
eight cycles of CHOP following discussion between the investigator and the Medical Monitor.  
On a given day, obinutuzumab should be given after venetoclax and prior to CHOP (with the 
exception of the first dose of prednisone in  each cycle), and patients should be observed for 
30 minutes prior to starting CHOP.  Patients at high risk for IRR or TLS complications may, at 
the investigator’s discretion, receive their obinut uzumab dose split over 2 consecutive days (e.g., 
100 mg on Day 1, 900 mg on Day 2).  During Cycle 1, obinutuzumab will also be administered 
on Days 8 and 15. 
Non-Investigational Medicinal Products
 
CHOP Chemotherapy 
CHOP chemotherapy consists of IV cyclophospham ide, IV doxorubicin, vincristine administered 
by IV push, and oral prednisone or prednisolone.  Standard CHOP will be administered for six 
21-day cycles.  Patients who experience ongoing response without excessive toxicity may 
receive up to eight cycles of CHOP followi ng discussion between the investigator and the 
Medical Monitor. 
• Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 administered intravenously on Day 1 
• Doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 administered intravenously on Day 1

disease 
• Topical steroids 
• Replacement corticosteroid therapy for an inherited or acquired deficiency 
• Steroid use to treat emergent issues not rela ted to anti-neoplastic intent is allowed for no 
more than 7 days per event.  For steroid treatment  > 7 days, the Medical Monitor must be 
consulted to discuss allowing the patient to continue treatment. 
 
Excluded Therapy 
Patients who are discontinued from study treatm ent will be followed for safety outcomes for 
30 days following the patient’s last dose of v enetoclax or CHOP (or 90 days following the 
patient’s last dose of rituximab or obinutuzumab, whichever is later) or until the patient receives 
another anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. 
Use of the following therapies is prohibited during the study: 
• Cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Supplem ental systemic therapy for prophylaxis of CNS disease is 
permitted according to institutional practice only after primary response assessment and 
must be recorded in the eCRF. 
• Radiotherapy prior to primary response assessment 
• Immunotherapy 
• Hormone therapy (other than contraceptives , hormone replacement therapy, or megestrol 
acetate) 
• Any therapies intended for the treatment of  lymphoma/leukemia whether U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) approved or experimental (outside of this study) 
• Warfarin may be co-administered with venetocla x with caution and with the guidance of the 
Medical Monitor. 
 
The following concomitant medications are not a llowed from 7 days prior to the first dose of 
study drug and during venetoclax administration: 
• Corticosteroid use  > 30 mg/day of prednisone or equi valent (with some exceptions). 
• Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers 
 
The following concomitant medications are not allowed from 7 days prior to the administration of the first dose of study drug:   
• Strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors 
• Strong and Moderate CYP3A inducers  
 
Exclude strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors through the DLT assessment period and consider alternative medications.  If a patient r equires use of these medications while he or she 
is receiving the target dose of venetoclax, once the DLT assessment period is complete, use 
with caution and reduce the venetoclax dose by 2-fold for moderate inhibitors and 4-fold for 
strong inhibitors during co-administration. 
After discontinuation of CYP3A inhibitor, wait fo r 3 days before venetoclax dose is increased 
back to the initial maintenance/target dose. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
42/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 • Exclude strong and moderate CYP3A inducers through the DLT assessment period and 
consider alternative medications.  If a patient requires use of these medications while he or 
she is receiving the target dose of venetoclax,  once the DLT assessment is complete, use 
with caution and contact the Medical Monitor for guidance. 
 
Statistical Methods  
Primary Analysis 
The final analysis will be based on patient dat a collected through study discontinuation.  
Analyses will be based on treated patients (i.e ., patients who have received any amount of 
R/G-CHOP or venetoclax).  Analyses will be provided separately for the dose-finding and 
extension cohorts where appropriate.  Data from patients who receive R-CHOP or G-CHOP 
only (i.e., have not received any venetoclax), will be summarized separately. 
Determination of Sample Size 
The sample size for the dose-finding stage is based on a modified 3  + 3 design in order to guide 
dose and schedule selection for the Phase II por tion on the basis of DLTs.  The expected 
enrollment for the dose-finding stage is 3 −6 patients per dose level in each of the 
R-CHOP  + venetoclax and G-CHOP  + venetoclax arms. 
The sample size for the R-CHOP  + venetoclax arm in Phase II is based on obtaining a sufficient 
number for estimation of PET-negative CR rate in patients with D E (Bcl-2 and c-Myc 
co-expressing) DLBCL, overall, for Bcl-2 hi gh patients, and within each of four mutually 
exclusive biological subgroups:  Bcl-2 high and ABC, Bcl-2 high and GCB, Bcl-2 low and ABC, 
and Bcl-2 low and GCB.  The expected enrollment for the R-CHOP  + venetoclax arm in Phase II 
is approximately 160 −200 patients in order to enroll approximately 50 D E-DLBCL patients, 
approximately 80 −100 Bcl-2 high patients, and approximately 40 −50 patients in each of the two 
Bcl-2 high subgroups.  With 50 patients, 95% confidence intervals for estimation of CR would 
have a margin of error not exceeding 16%.  The margin of error would decrease to 9% with 150 
patients and to 8% with 200 patients

46/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 BACKGROUND ON DISEASE 
1.1.1 Indolent Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma  
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is the most common hematologic malignancy in adults.  
It is estimated that in 2010 there were 93,172 new cases of NHL in Europe and 65,540 new cases of NHL in the United States ( GLOBOCAN 2008 ; 
American Cancer Society 2010 ).  The majority of NHLs (also known as malignant 
lymphoma) is of B-cell or igin and cha 
racterized by the expression of a membrane 
antigen, CD20, that is important in cell cycle initiation and differentiation.  NHL can be divided into aggressive and indolent NHL.  Indolent NHLs are a heterogeneous group of malignant lymphomas and account for about one- third of all NHLs.  Follicular lymphoma 
(FL) is the most common subtype of indolent NHL in the Western hemisphere and is associated with follicle center B cells that typically contain the BCL2  chromosome 
translocation t(14:18) that leads to overexpression of the intracellular anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.  Although FL is the most common subtype of indolent NHL, there are also several histological non-follicular subtypes including marginal zone lymphoma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (also k nown as lymphoplasmacy tic lymphoma), and 
small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).  Early-stage indolent NHL may be effectively treated with radiation therapy, but advanced stages remain incurable. 
The clinical course of indolent NHL is characterized by remission and relapse.  Although 
there is no agreed-upon standard therapy for indolent NHL, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) is a common regimen that results in high response rates and long remission duration in many patients, particularly in those patients with FL ( Czuczman et al. 1999 ).  The disease initially 
responds to radiation an
d/or immunochemotherapy with conventional agents, but 
patients eventually suffer multiple relapses distinguished by increasing refractoriness and decreasing duration of response (DOR) in subsequent lines of therapy.  Patients with advanced stage disease are not considered curable with conventional treatment and ultimately die from recurrent disease or treatment-related toxicity.  Therefore, there 
is a need for the development of new treatments that could improve both response and survival rates of patients with indolent NHL. 
1.1.2 Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma  
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of NHL, comprising approximately 30% of all NHL cases.  Approximately 75% of patients with DLBCL who are treated with current standard R-CHOP therapy achieve a complete remission, and 50% −60% of patients are cured of their disease with this treatment. 
Although there is currently no way to prospectively identify individual patients who will be cured, clinical factors are used to define prognostic risk groups associated with predictive outcomes.  The International Prognostic Index (IPI) is a prognostic tool that uses five clinical factors to predict outcome of patients with aggressive NHL.  The IPI 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
47/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 defines four distinct prognostic subgroups depending on the number of negative 
prognostic factors at diagnosis.  Although patients with low IPI (i.e., with no or only one negative prognostic finding) have overall excellent outcomes with 3-year 
progression-free survival (PFS) of 80% −90% (Sehn et al. 2007; Advani et al. 2010 ), 
patients with higher risk have poorer outcomes with 3-year 
PFS ranging from 33% to 
70%. 
For patients who are not cured by first-line therapy, high-dose (HD) chemotherapy 
followed by autologous stem cell transplantation offers a second chance for cure in a minority of cases.  However, approximately half of patients will not respond to subsequent therapy because of refractory disease ( Gisselbrecht et al. 2010 ) and a 
significant number are ineligible for this aggressive therapy 
because of age or 
comorbidities. 
Patients who either relapse after or are ineligible for stem cell transplantation as a result 
of refractory disease or frailty have poor outcomes.  Responses to subsequent therapies range from 10% −35% in most cases ( Robertson et al. 2007 ; Coleman et al. 2008 ; 
Wiernik et al. 2008), with only occasional durable responses.  The fact tha
 t most patients 
who are not cured with the use of the standard front-line R-CHOP or comparable immunochemotherapy will die of lymphoma underscores the need for novel approaches to initial treatment of this aggressive disease. 
Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic molecule overexpressed in many hematologic malignancies 
including many DLBCLs, either through translocation of the BCL2 gene in juxtaposition 
with the IGH gene t(14;18), through gene amplification, or by other mechanisms (Gascoyne et al. 1997 ; Davis et al. 2001 ).  Bcl-2 protein inh i
 bits death of lymphoma cells 
in response to chemotherapy and other anti-neoplastic agents including rituximab (R).  Overexpression of BCL2 has been shown to be associated with inferior outcomes in 
DLBCL with standard treatment ( Iqbal et al. 2011; Hu et al. 2013 ; Visco et al. 2013 ).  
The frequent overexpression of BCL2 combined with its contr 
ibution to therapy 
resistance makes BCL2 inhibition an attractive therapeutic target in DLBCL. 
DLBCL is a molecularly heterogeneous disease with different molecular subtypes that have been identified with the use of gene expression profiling ( Rosenwald et al. 2002 ).  
The two major subtypes, germinal center B cell-like (GCB) and activated B cell−like (AB 
C), show activation of different oncogenic and survival pathways.  
Furthermore, they are associated with different prognoses, with survival being significantly better in patients with GCB-DLBCL than in those with ABC-DLBCL.  Although evidence for a prognostic effect of BCL2 is greatest in the GCB subtype, both 
GCB- and ABC-DLBCL overexpress BCL2 in approximately 50% of cases, arguing for 
biological relevance of BCL2 in both subtypes.  The implications of BCL2 inhibition in 
each subtype are unknown, supporting the need to investigate the activity of BCL2 inhibition in combination with chemotherapy in each subgroup.  Patients with expression 
of both Bcl-2 and c-Myc proteins (i.e., double expressor - [DE-] DLBCL) have been 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
48/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 recently identified as a poor prognostic subgroup, characterized in part by 
overexpression of BCL2 , for whom the addition of venetoclax (GDC-0199) might add 
substantial therapeutic benefit.  Patients with (DE -) DLBCL, even in the absence of 
chromosomal translocation, have an inferior outcome when compared with patients with DLBCL that does not express both proteins, and thus represent a poor-prognosis group in need of effective therapies ( Green et al. 2012; Johnson et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2013; 
Valera et al. 2013 ).  Since BCL2 expression contributes to t he pathogen
 esis of some 
types of lymphoid malignancies, including DLBCL, the inhibition of BCL2  function with 
venetoclax could restore the sensitivity of tumor cells to the current standard therapy, R-CHOP, and therefore could provide an effective new therapy for this group with a high, unmet medical need. 
Patients with chromosomal translocations in BCL2 and MYC (i.e. Double Hit) have also 
been identified as a poor prognostic subgroup ( Savage et al. 2009; Barrans et al. 2010 ) 
and also comprise a subgroup of patients with an unmet medical need.
 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON THE MOLECULES 
1.2.1 Bcl-2 Protein Family  
The Bcl-2 family proteins are important regul ators of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.  
The BCL2 oncogene was first identified in FL where the t(14;18) chromosomal 
translocation results in significant overexpression of the protein in B cells.  The BCL2 
family of genes encodes a family of closely related proteins that possess either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic activity and share up to four BCL2 homology domains 
(Cory and Adams 2002 ; Borner 2003 ; Cory et al. 2003).  BCL2 overexpression is a 
major contributor to the pathogenesis of many types of lymphoid malignancies and 
has 
been implicated as a cause of chemotherapy resistance. 
1.2.2 Venetoclax  
1.2.2.1 Venetoclax Nonclinical Acti vity and Pharmacokinetic Profile 
Venetoclax (synonymous with GDC-0199 and ABT-199; venetoclax will be used throughout the protocol) is a highly selective, orally available small molecule Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor that binds with high affinity (dissociation constant [K
i] < 0.10 nM) to Bcl-2 
and with lower affinity to other Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-X L and Bcl-w ( > 480-fold 
and >  2000-fold lower affinity than to Bcl-2, respectively).  Overexpression of 
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and antagonism of the action of these proteins might overcome resistance and enhance response to therapy.  Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 fa mily members are associated with tumor 
initiation, disease progression, and drug resistance, making them compelling targets for anti-tumor therapy. 
In vitro, venetoclax has demonstrated broad cell-killing activity against a panel of 
lymphoma and leukemia cells including B-cell FL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), DLBCL, 
and acute myeloid leukemia.  Venetoclax was especially potent against cell lines 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
49/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 expressing high levels of Bcl-2.  Leukemia and lymphoma cell lines bearing the t(14;18) 
translocation were significantly more sens itive to venetoclax than were wild-type cell 
lines. 
Venetoclax inhibited subcutaneous (SC) murine xenograft growth of human tumor cell 
lines derived from acute lym phoblastic leukemia (ALL) and NHL. 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of venetoclax was evaluated in multiple animal species.  In mice, rats, monkeys, and dogs, low plasma clearance and low volumes of distribution characterized the venetoclax PK profile.  Half-lives ranged from 2.2 hours in monkeys to 12 hours in dogs.  Food had a marked effect on the oral bioavailability in dogs, with a 30% −50% higher plasma concentration compared with fasted animals. 
Venetoclax demonstrated high protein binding to human, rat, dog, and monkey plasma proteins ( >
 99.9%).  In rats, venetoclax was widely distributed into liver, kidneys, spleen, 
heart, lungs, small intestine, and white fat but was poorly distributed in testes, brain, muscle, and bone.  Liver metabolism was the major route of elimination, with biliary excretion of the parent drug playing the secondary role in rats.  Venetoclax showed moderate metabolic stability in in vitro hepatic systems across species tested, except for low to moderate stability in dog hepatocytes. 
In vitro, venetoclax was metabolized by CYP3A4; thus, co-administration of venetoclax 
with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, is predicted to cause a significant increase in the exposure of venetoclax.  Venetoclax is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP.  Active uptake of venetoclax was not observed in cells over expressing OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT1 
indicating that venetoclax is not a substrate for those transporters in vitro. 
On the basis of in vitro results, venetoclax was a P-gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1 inhibitor.  
It was not a potent in vitro inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2D6 
(IC
50 > 30 μM); and it did not induce CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 at concentrations up to 10 μM.  
Venetoclax is also not predicted to cause inhibition of CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
and UGT1A1 at clinically relevant concentrations.  It is not an inhibitor of UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7. 
A more detailed discussion of the nonclinical activity of venetoclax including 
pharmacokinetics and metabolism can be found in the ABT-199/GDC-0199 Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.2.2.2 Venetoclax Nonclinical Toxicology 
Toxicology assessments completed to date with venetoclax ar e general toxicology 
studies with periods of once-daily oral dosing ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months in mice, from 2 weeks to 13 weeks in rats, and from 1 week to 9 weeks in dogs; in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology; embryo-fetal development in female mice and rabbits; and fertility and early embryonic development in male and female mice.  The maximum 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
50/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 steady state venetoclax plasma exposures (mean area under the concentration-time 
curve [AUC]) achieved in the IND-enabling 4 week studies were 92 µg  • h/mL (at 
600 mg/kg/day) in mice and 572 µg  • h/mL (at 150 mg/kg/day) in dogs.  In the chronic 
toxicity studies, AUCs reached 34.1 µg •h/mL (at 300 mg/kg/day) in mice and 
86 µg  • h/mL (at 20 mg/kg/day) in do gs.  In rats, exposures were higher in females than 
in males; at dosages of 150 and 400 mg/kg/ day in the 13 week maximum tolerated dose 
study, exposures ranged up to 83.1 −127.8 µg  • h/mL in females and up to 
26.4 −44.2 µg  • h/mL in males. 
The primary toxicities associated with venetoclax administration included effects on the hematologic system (decreased lymphocytes and erythrocytes) in mice, rats, and dogs; the male dog reproductive system (testicular germ cell depletion); and embryo-fetal toxicity in mice. 
In mice, rats, and dogs, venetoclax produced generally dose-related decreases in 
lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (of up to 75% in mice, up to 64% in rats, and up to 81% in dogs) and in lymphoid tissues.  In dogs, the recovery of lymphocyte counts (total lymphocytes, CD4
 + and CD8  + T cells and mature B cells) was prolonged, 
requiring up to 18 weeks after completion of 2 weeks of dosing.  B cells were the most sensitive lymphocyte subtype based on the magnitude of decrease and/or the length of time required for recovery (i.e., 25%
−111% of individual baseline; mean reversal to 
54% of baseline average).  T-cell subsets reversed more readily and showed more dose-dependence in recovery time and extent.  Decreases of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues were reversible in mice and rever sible to partially reversible in dogs.  
Venetoclax-related decreases in lymphocy tes in blood and lymphoid tissues are 
considered pharmacologically-mediated and non-adverse ( Marsden and Strasser, 2003 ). 
In the 4 we 
ek mouse and dog studies, dose-related reversible decreases in RBC mass 
were observed.  Effects on RBC mass were typified by hemoglobin decreases.  At the highest dosages administered, decreases in hemoglobin reached -21% in mice at 600 mg/kg/day and -23% in dogs at 150 mg/kg/ day, and were considered to be adverse 
based on a criterion of -20% decrease.  In rats, decreases in hemoglobin were more severe than in mice and dogs at comparable exposures and reached 30% to 49% at 
≥ 150 mg/kg/day in females.  Hematologic parameters (lymphocyte counts and RBC 
mass) are readily monitored in clinical trial subjects. 
In dogs, venetoclax produced adverse, non-reversible, non −dose-related microscopic 
findings of testicular germ cell depletion at all dosages tested; there were no testicular 
effects in mice.  The translatability of the testicular findings in dogs to humans is 
unknown, but this change may be related to venetoclax pharmacology, as one or more members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins play a role in spermatogenesis (Olderied et al. 2001 ; Sugiyama et al. 2001 ; Yan et al. 2003).  No e ff
 ects of venetoclax 
have been identified in female reproductive tissues in mice or dogs in general toxicology studies. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
51/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Venetoclax resulted in increased post-implantation loss and decreased fetal body 
weights in the mouse embryo-fetal development study at the highest dosage administered (150 mg/kg/day); the no-observed -adverse-effect level was defined at the 
mid-dose of 50 mg/kg/day.  Venetoclax was not teratogenic, and there were no other 
effects on development or fertility. 
Additional noteworthy effects of venetoclax included white hair coat discoloration in 
dogs (occurring after approximately 3 months of dosing in the 9 month study) and single cell necrosis in various epithelial tissues (gallbladder, exocrine pancreas, stomach, exocrine pancreas, and epididymides) in dogs.  Single cell necrosis was minimal except for non
−dose-dependent minimal to mild single cell necrosis in the 
pylorus of the stomach at ≥ 2 mg/kg/day in the 9 month stu dy.  After 4 weeks of dosing 
and a 4 week recovery period, reversibility was observed in the gallbladder and exocrine pancreas, but minimal single cell necrosis was still present in the epididymides and 
prostate (potentially related to the testicular effects) and in the stomach.  Single cell necrosis was considered not to be adverse due to its minimal to mild magnitude and because no loss of mucosal integrity was observed histopathologically.  The hair coat change correlated histopathologically with decreased pigment in hair follicle bulbs, and is consistent with the pharmacologic inhibition of Bcl-2 by venetoclax, leading to Bcl-2 functional loss in hair follicle melanocytes dependent on Bcl-2 for survival (Yamamura et al. 1996 )  A d e
 dicated physical examinat ion of the skin and extensive 
ophthalmic examinations determined that pigmentation of the skin and in the eye (particularly, the iris and fundus) of the dog appeared unaffected.  This was confirmed by the absence of associated histopathologic findings in skin (other than in hair follicles) and in the eye.  Consequently, white hair coat discoloration was considered non-adverse; reversibility has not been assessed. 
Minor effects of venetoclax were:  mild, dose-related, transient post-dose emesis, 
increased salivation, and fecal alterations (unformed or watery feces); minimally increased pigment in Kupffer cells and macrophages in the liver and gallbladder, respectively; and clinical signs of skin swelling, all in dogs.  With regard to the latter finding, dogs at the high dosage of 150 mg/kg/day in the 4 week study had clinical signs of swelling of the skin on the ears, head (cranial area), and forepaws and/or hindpaws.  Most but not all animals (8 of 10 dogs) were affected, and in three dogs the swelling reaction was observed after the first dose.  The clinical signs were transient and sporadic in occurrence, and were absent during the recovery period.  A mechanistic basis for the swelling reactions was not establis hed, but the clinical signs were mild to 
moderate in severity and re versible, and there were no signs of anaphylaxis. 
There was no evidence of in vitro or in vivo genetic toxicity of venetoclax, nor was there evidence of phototoxicity. 
Venetoclax was tested in a battery of safety pharmacology assays, and produced no 
effects in the CNS/neurobehavioral or respiratory studies in mice at oral doses up to 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
52/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 and including the highest oral dose of 600 mg/k g.  No effects on QTc were observed up 
to a maximum plasma concentration of 46 μg/mL in dogs.  In conscious dogs, 
venetoclax did not produce any cardiovascular effects up to and including the highest 
oral dose of 150 mg/kg (maximum  concentration observed [Cmax]  = 16 μg/mL).  In the 
anesthetized dog at higher plasma concentrations, venetoclax produced mild reductions in myocardial contractility (-6% to -13% ) and cardiac output (-11% to -19%) at 
plasma concentrations of 
≥ 16 μg/mL and ≥ 32 μg/mL, respectively.  These 
concentrations are greater than the plasma concentration of venetoclax in humans (average Cmax
 = 6.09 μg/mL at the 1200 mg/day dose). 
See the ABT-199/Venetoclax Investigator’s Brochure for details of the nonclinical studies.  
1.2.2.3 Venetoclax Clinical Experience 
As of 30 June 2013, a total of 137 patients were dosed with venetoclax in AbbVie and Genentech/Roche oncology studies.  Doses administered in venetoclax clinical studies have ranged from 20 to 1200 mg. 
The first-in-human venetoclax monotherapy dose-escalation study (Study M12-175) is 
ongoing in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/SLL and NHL.  Study M13-365 (venetoclax and rituximab administered in combination to patients with relapsed or refractory CLL), Study M12-630 (venetoclax administered in combination with bendamustine and rituximab [BR] to patients with relapsed/refractory NHL), and Study GP28331 (venetoclax administered in combination with obinutuzumab to patients with relapsed or refractory CLL) are also ongoing. 
Study M12-175 includes patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL (treatment Arm A) or 
NHL (treatment Arm B).  Patients receive daily dosing until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. 
Study M13-365 includes patients with relaps ed/refractory CLL.  Patients receive 
venetoclax starting at 50 mg/day, and the dose is escalated to the target cohort dose of 
venetoclax over 3 weeks, followed by continual daily dosing of venetoclax at the target cohort dose until disease progression.  Rituximab is administered starting on Week 4 Day 1 at 375 mg/m
2 followed by subsequent administrations of 500 mg/m2 
rituximab on Day 1 of Weeks 5, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26. 
Study M12-630 is a study of venetoclax administered in combination with BR to patients 
with relapsed /refractory NHL.  Patients receive venetoclax starting at 50 mg/day for 3 days with each 28-day cycle of BR, continuing for 6 cycles.  Venetoclax dose and duration per cycle are escalated in consecutive cohorts. 
Study GP28331 includes patients with relaps ed/refractory CLL.  Patients receive 
venetoclax doses that are escalated to the target dose before obinutuzumab treatment is 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
53/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 initiated.  Obinutuzumab is administered at a dose of 1000 mg, with the first dose split 
over 2 days. 
Preliminary safety, PK, and efficacy data are summarized below on the basis of data 
cutoff dates of 11 January 2013 for safety listings. 
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessments are available for patients enrolled in 
Study M12-175 (through Cohort 8 with a target venetoclax dose of 1200 mg), Study M13-365 (through Cohort 3 with a target venetoclax dose of 400 mg), and Study M12-630 (through Cohort 2 with a target venetoclax dose of 100 mg for 3 days with each cycle of BR). 
Seven DLTs of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and two DLTs of fatalities in the setting of 
TLS were reported in the venetoclax clinical program for patients with CLL/SLL 
(Studies M12-175 and M13-365).  Six DLTs of TLS occurred in Study M12-175 at either the starting dose of 100 or 200 mg venetoclax (3 patients in Cohort 1) or the lower lead-in dose of 50 mg venetoclax implemented to minimize the risk of TLS (1 patient each in Cohorts 2 and 4).  The sixth DLT of TLS occurred at the maximum designated cohort dose administered in the study (Cohort 8; 1200 mg), and the patient experienced sudden death.  In Study M13-365, there was a single DLT of death caused by Grade 5 hyperkalemia in a setting of TLS at the 50-mg lead-in dose.  In addition, single non-DLT adverse events of TLS were reported in 1 patient with MCL in Study M12-175 
and in 1 patient with CLL in Study M13-365.  Events of laboratory TLS were also observed in 2 patients during dosing in Study GP28331 at lead-in doses of 50 mg venetoclax. 
In Study GP28331, 4 patients received study treatment; 3 patients received venetoclax 
for between 3 and 15 days and 1 patient received obinutuzumab and a single dose of venetoclax.  All patients discontinued therapy when the study was put on temporary hold after two TLS-related deaths occurred in other clinical studies.  In this study, the only reported adverse event related to venetoclax was a serious event of hyperphosphatemia in the setting of laboratory TLS that occurred after the third dose of venetoclax in a patient who had not received obinutuzumab.  The event resolved with IV hydration and 
discontinuation of study therapy. 
Two DLTs were reported in patients with NHL treated with venetoclax 
(Studies M12-175 and M12-630).  Both DLTs occurred in Study M12-175 at the 600-mg dose in Cohort 5.  This study enrolled a total of 10 patients with a 300-mg lead-in dose and a designated cohort dose of 600 mg.  One patient experienced a DLT of serious Grade 3 febrile neutropenia and the other patient experienced a DLT of non-serious Grade 4 neutropenia.  Dosing was interrupted and patients were treated with medication; the events resolved and the patients restarted therapy at a reduced dose of 300 mg.  No DLTs were reported in Cohort 6 at the designated cohort dose of 800 mg. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
54/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Additional DLTs included 1 case each of histiocytosis hematophagic and 
thrombocytopenia in patients with CLL (both considered related to rituximab rather than venetoclax). 
Grade ≥
 3 hematologic toxicity was common in patients with CLL who received 
venetoclax, but less common in patients with NHL.  With single-agent venetoclax in 
Study M12-175, 37.5% of patients with CLL experienced Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 7% experienced Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, whereas 13% of patients with NHL experienced Grade ≥
 3 neutropenia and 10% experienced Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia.  
Hematologic toxicity in Study M12-630 (venetoclax in combination with BR in NHL) was not significantly greater than that expected with BR alone. 
Data on venetoclax and human pregnancy or venetoclax and drug abuse and drug 
dependency are not available. 
Preliminary efficacy data based on investigator assessment of radiographic data 
available as of 30 June 2013 are presented below for Study M12-175; efficacy data are not yet available for other venetoclax studies.  In treatment Arm A, 54 of 56 patients were considered evaluable for response (i.e., completed the Week 6 evaluation or discontinued prior to Week 6).  Objective response (OR) was reported in 46 of 54 evaluable patients (85.2%) in treatment Arm A:  5 patients (8.9%) experienced complete response (CR), 2 patients (3.7%) experienced CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi), and 39 patients (72.2%) experienced partial response (PR).  In treatment Arm B, 32 patients with NHL were considered evaluable for response.  OR was reported in 17  of 32 patients (53%) in treatment Arm B:  3 patients (9.4%) had a CR and 14 patients (53.7%) had a PR.  All 8 patients (100%) with MCL in treatment Arm B experienced a PR. 
Details and most current data are provided in the ABT-199/Venetoclax Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
1.2.2.4 Clinical Pharmacoki netics and Pharmacodynamics 
Preliminary PK data for venetoclax are available from ongoing oncology Studies M12-175, M12-630, and M13-365 in patients with hematologic malignancies. 
The venetoclax formulation currently used in clinical studies is a tablet formulation with 
strengths of 10, 50, and 100 mg.  The tablet formulation was orally administered after a low-fat meal.  Food increased the bioavailability of venetoclax by 3- to 4-fold.  Preliminary PK results indicated that the absorption of venetoclax after the oral dosing was relatively slow.  Venetoclax plasma concentrations peaked at approximately 6 hours 
after dosing.  The mean terminal phase elimination half-life of venetoclax was approximately 17 hours and the mean oral clearance was approximately 13 L/hr after a single dose.  There was no apparent difference in the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax between patients with CLL/SLL or NHL.  The combined data from patients 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
55/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 with CLL/SLL and NHL suggested that venetoclax exposure was approximately dose 
proportional across the 150- to 900-mg dose levels.  In the limited number of patients to date, co-administration of BR did not show apparent impact on venetoclax pharmacokinetics. 
Details and most current data are provided in the ABT-199/Venetoclax Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
1.2.3 Obinutuzumab  
1.2.3.1 Obinutuzumab Mechanism of Action 
Obinutuzumab ([G], synonymous with GA101 and RO5072759; the term obinutuzumab 
will be used throughout the protocol) is a humanized and glycoengineered monoclonal antibody derived by humanization of the parental B-Ly1 mouse antibody and subsequent glycoengineering leading to the following characteristics ( Mössner et al. 2010 ): 
• High-affinity binding to C D
20 
• Type II binding to the CD20 epitope, leading to low complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity related to the recognition of the CD20 epitope and the lack of 
CD20 localization into lipid rafts after binding of the monoclonal antibody to CD20  
• Compared with the chimeric Type I anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, increased 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) related to an improved binding of obinutuzumab to the different allotypes of Fc γRIIIa expressed by natural 
killer cells and monocytes 
• Compared with rituximab, increased direct cell-death induction related to an elbow 
hinge amino exchange of the Fab region and Type II binding of the CD20 epitope 
 
Given the significantly greater ADCC and direct cell-death induction, it is possible that 
obinutuzumab may have greater efficacy than rituximab, particularly in the 80% −85% of 
patients who are carriers of the Fc γRIIIa low-affinity receptor polymorphism 
(FF/FV genotype), because such patients ma y have decreased overall survival (OS) 
compared with patients with the high-affinity (V/V) polymorphism who demonstrate improved survival following therapy with chemotherapy plus either rituximab or I
131-tositumomab ( Persky et al. 2012). 
Obinutuzumab is currently being 
explored in lymphoid malignancies, such as DLBCL, FL, 
and CLL.  Preliminary data suggest possible increased anti-lymphoma efficacy over rituximab, a hypothesis that is currently  being explored in several randomized trials 
including a Phase III study of R-CHOP versus obinutuzumab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (G-CHOP) in DLBCL (Study BO21005). 
1.2.3.2 Obinutuzumab Nonclinical Toxicology 
The nonclinical toxicology of obinutuzumab has been evaluated in repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys given weekly intravenously (30-minute infusion) for up to 26 weeks in duration and weekly SC injections for 4 weeks in duration.  The high dose of 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
56/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 50 mg/kg in the 26-week study resulted in a steady-state AUC from Time 0 to 24 hours 
(AUC 0−24) exposure of 341,000 μg • hr/mL that is approximately 61-fold above that of the 
clinical exposure of 5584 μg • hr/mL. 
Consistent with expected pharmacological activity, obinutuzumab caused marked decreases in B cells with corresponding lymphoid depletion in spleen and lymph nodes.  Circulating CD40-positive mature B cells began to reverse after several months without treatment and maximally reversed to 7% −152% of baseline by 37 weeks.  In addition, 
transient decreases in natural killer (NK) cells  were observed; this finding is consistent 
with the pharmacological effect of Fc γRIIIa binding.  Suspected opportunistic infections 
in as many as three unscheduled deaths were  considered a possible secondary result of 
B-cell depletion. 
Obinutuzumab was immunogenic in the cynomol gus monkey; this immunogenicity led to 
reduced systemic exposures in several animals and abrogation of the pharmacological 
activity.  Hypersensitivity reactions were noted that included systemic inflammation and infiltrates consistent with immune-complex −mediated hypersensitivity reactions such as 
arteritis/periarteritis, glomerulonephritis, and serosal/adventitial inflammation and led to unscheduled termination in 6 animals. 
Both the clinical IV formulation of obinutuz umab and the SC formulation were locally well 
tolerated across studies.  No effects were present in male and female reproductive 
parameters included in the 26-week IV-dose study.  No obinutuzumab-related effects were observed on CNS, respiratory, or cardiovascular (CV) functions. 
Significant increases in cytokine secretion caused by obinutuzumab were measured in 
in vitro assays with the use of undiluted human whole blood, indicating that obinutuzumab has an increased propensity to trigger first infusion-related cytokine release in patients. 
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies. 
1.2.3.3 Obinutuzumab Nonclinical Efficacy 
Obinutuzumab has demonstrated in vivo efficacy superior to rituximab in various human 
lymphoma xenograft models.  Both antibodies were tested in human SUDHL-4 cells (a DLBCL model) subcutaneously injected in severe combined immunodeficient beige mice.  Rituximab administration was started when tumors were established and rapidly growing.  Results showed that rituximab at  10 mg/kg inhibited tumor growth compared 
with rituximab at 1 mg/kg; however, increasing the rituximab dose to 30 mg/kg did not result in increased efficacy.  In contrast, obinutuzumab showed a dose-dependent increase in efficacy in the range of 1 −30 mg/kg.  Results showed complete tumor 
regression in all animals and lasting tumor eradication in 9 of 10 animals at the highest dose of 30 mg/kg and in 1 of 10 animals at a dose of 10 mg/kg. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
57/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Additional studies have also shown similar results, with obinutuzumab treatment 
controlling tumor growth, whereas vehicle- and rituximab-treated tumors were not controlled ( Mössner et al. 2010 ). 
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on  the nonclin
ical studies. 
1.2.3.4 Obinutuzumab Clinical Experience 
As of July 2013, more than 1900 patients with CD20-positive malignant disease have been treated with obinutuzumab in clinical trials.  Clinical data for obinutuzumab are available from six clinical trials including three Phase I and/or Phase II studies of obinutuzumab monotherapy, a Phase Ib chemotherapy combination study in NHL (Study BO21000), and two Phase III studies (Study BO21004 in CLL and Study GA04753g in NHL). 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs), mostly Grades 1 and 2, are the most common adverse 
events observed during therapy.  IRRs have been associated predominantly with the first infusion and generally occur early during the infusion, shortly after the infusion, or, in some cases, up to 24 hours after the completion of the infusion.  In a few patients, concurrent signs of laboratory TLS were observed.  The incidence and intensity of IRRs decreased with subsequent infusions of obinutuzumab.  Other frequently observed adverse events include infections and neutropenia.  On the basis of preliminary observations, extensive tumor burden may be a predisposing factor for the occurrence of some IRRs.  Grades 3− 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, including febrile 
neutropenia, have been reported with obinutuzumab and were associated predominantly with treatment of CLL rather than NHL.  Given its anticipated mode of action that results in profound B-cell depletion, obinutuzumab may be associated with an increased risk of infections during and after treatment. 
Data from Study BO20999 (obinutuzumab m onotherapy) showed safety and efficacy of 
single-agent obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed indolent and aggressive lymphomas.  
Responses were seen at both lower (400 mg) and higher (800 and 1600 mg) doses, although responses increased at the higher dose, with 54% of patients with indolent lymphoma and 32% of patients with aggressive lymphomas showing PR or CR at end of treatment ( Morschhauser et al. 2013 ; Salles et al. 2013 ). 
Study BO21000 evaluated obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy, both 
fludarabine/ cyclophosph
amide and CHOP ( Radford et al. 2013).  Both chemotherapy 
combinations were shown to be feasible in patients with previously untreated or relapsed/ref r
actory FL with response rates of > 90% for both regimens.  Safety was 
acceptable with no new or unexpected adverse effects observed.  The most common adverse event was neutropenia. 
Data from obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil in patients with CLL 
(Study BO21004) showed increased efficacy of the combination over chlorambucil alone 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
58/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 with a hazard ratio for PFS of 0.14.  IRRs were common and neutropenia occurred at 
increased frequency with the combination therapy, but there was no increase in infections or treatment-related deaths. 
See the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure for additional details on the clinical 
studies. 
1.2.3.5 Obinutuzumab Pharmaco kinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
A two-compartment model comprising a time-varying clearance pathway and a linear clearance pathway provides an adequate description of the pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab following IV administration in Studies BO20999 and BO21003.  Following the infusion of obinutuzumab, the elimination appears to be characterized by a linear clearance pathway that is dependent on time (i.e., starting at a typical value of 630 mL/day and then gradually decreasing to an asymptote of 60 mL/day at steady state).  Tumor burden may potentially contribute significantly to the clearance of obinutuzumab, especially at the beginning of treatment when CD20-positive tumor cells are most abundant.  As tumor burden decreases, the clearance reaches an asymptote that is believed to be primarily a function of the proteolytic metabolic clearance.  
Therefore, some patients with a high tumor burden may appear to clear the drug from the plasma faster than patients with a low tumor burden because obinutuzumab binds to the CD20-positive tumor cells and is effectively removed from the plasma.  Therefore, the clearance of the drug will vary with time, because repeated treatments with obinutuzumab will reduce the quantity of CD20-positive tumor cells.  Consequently, the number of obinutuzumab administrations duri ng the first cycle of treatment may be 
expected to reduce the number of CD20-positive tumor cells, thus minimizing the impact of the time-varying clearance pathway on obinutuzumab exposure. 
Treatment with obinutuzumab resulted in ext ensive B-cell depletion, with all patients 
showing a reduction in B-cell counts to absolute zero at some stage of their treatment 
cycle.  Overall, there has been no notable increase in complement levels before and after infusion, but transient changes have been observed in the levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 before and after infusion. 
1.3 STUDY RATIONALE 
B-cell NHL cells, including DLBCL, express CD20 antigen.  Anti-CD20 therapy (rituximab) has been demonstrated to provide enhanced anti-tumor activity in combination with other agents targeting the disease ( Coiffier et al. 2002; Hiddemann et al. 2005 ), leading 
to acceptance of R-CHOP as standard of care in most DLBCL and a common choice of 
therapy for other B-cell NHL.  Howe 
ver, significant room for improvement exists.  BCL2 
is overexpressed in most FL and many DLBCLs as a consequence of the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation or gene amplification and is associated with a poor prognosis in DLBCL ( Iqbal et al. 2011 ).  Bcl-2 is li kely to pl
 ay a role in resistance to the 
pro-apoptotic activities of chemoimmunotherapeutic regimens , such as R-CHOP.  
Therefore, the addition of a Bcl-2 inhibitor to R-CHOP has the potential to significantly 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
59/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 enhance the anti-leukemic activity of the regimen and to result in improved clinical 
outcomes.  Navitoclax is an inhibitor of Bc l-2 previously studied in the clinic that, 
because of its concomitant inhibition of Bcl-xL (a survival factor for platelets), causes dose-related thrombocytopenia.  Nonclinical data supporting the combination of R-CHOP and Bcl-2 inhibitors include murine xenograft models that demonstrated significantly improved anti-lymphoma activi ty of the combination of R-CHOP and 
navitoclax (ABT-263) over the activity of either treatment regimen alone (Ackler et al. 2010 ). 
Obinutuzumab is currently being co mpared with
 rituximab in combination with CHOP 
chemotherapy in a randomized trial in patients with DLBCL (Study BO21005).  If obinutuzumab proves to be superior to rituximab, the standard of care would change to G-CHOP.  Therefore, the combination of venetoclax with both R-CHOP and G-CHOP will be examined in this study. 
DLBCL is a molecularly heterogeneous disease, with a variety of molecular subtypes 
identified through gene expression profiling ( Rosenwald et al. 2002 ).  The two major 
subtypes, GCB and ABC, show activation of oncogenic and survival pathways that differ 
from each other and are associat ed 
with different prognoses.  Although evidence for a 
prognostic effect of Bcl-2 is greatest in the GCB subtype, both GCB and ABC DLBCL overexpress Bcl-2 in approximately 50% of cases, arguing for biological relevance of Bcl-2 in both subtypes.  The implications of Bcl-2 inhibition in each subtype are unknown; therefore, after the appropriate dose is identified, the combination will be investigated in an expanded cohort with enough patients in each molecular subgroup to obtain preliminary information regarding activity in each group. 
This study will explore the safety of the combination of venetoclax plus R-CHOP or 
G-CHOP in patients with B-cell NHL who are believed to be appropriate candidates for R-CHOP therapy during initial dose-finding cohorts and will further explore safety and efficacy in Phase II cohorts of patients with previously untreated DLBCL in order to identify appropriate populations for evaluation in a Phase III setting.  In addition, efficacy 
of venetoclax plus R-CHOP in the subgroup of patients with DE-DLBCL will be explored.  
DE-DLBCL is a recently defined poor prognostic subgroup, characterized in part by 
overexpression of Bcl-2, for whom the addition of venetoclax might add substantial 
therapeutic benefit.

3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
This is a Phase Ib/II, multicenter, open-label, dose-finding study of venetoclax 
administered orally in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab and standard doses of CHOP in patients with NHL.  The study will consist of two stages:  a dose-finding Phase Ib stage and a Phase II expansion stage.  In the Phase I portion of the study, two parallel treatment arms will explore doses of venetoclax ranging from 200 to 800 mg administered in combination with R-CHOP and G-CHOP (see Figure 1 ).  Patients will be 
treated for a total of eigh t cycles (six 
cycles of CHOP and eight cycles of 
venetoclax  + rituximab or venetoclax  + obinutuzumab).  Each cycle will consist of 21 days.  
Patients who experience ongoing response without excessive toxicity may receive up to eight cycles of CHOP following discussion between the investigator and the Medical Monitor.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of venetoclax in combination with 
R-CHOP and G-CHOP will be determined separately for each arm during the dose-finding stage.   
The dose and dose schedule for venetoclax for each arm determined in Phase I will be 
used in the Phase II expansion stage for that arm. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
62/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 For the Phase II portion of the study, the venetoclax dose for Arm A is 800 mg on a 
non-continuous dosing schedule of Cycle 1 Days 4 −10 and Cycles 2 −8 Days 1− 10, as 
determined by the Phase Ib portion of the study based on safety and tolerability observed in patients treated in the dose escalation portion of the study (see Section 3.2.3 for justification).   
If there are concerns ab
out the tolerability of the Phase II dose at any time during the 
Phase II study, a lower dose or an alternative dosing schedule for venetoclax  + R-CHOP 
or G-CHOP may be explored on a case by case basis based on the guideline provided in Section 4.3.  
For th e Ph
ase II R-CHOP arm  of the study , after the first 20 patients  have completed 
Cycles 1 and 2 of study treatment, the Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC) and Scientific Oversight Committee (SOC; see Section 3.1.1) will meet to review safety data 
for all patien ts treated in 
both the Phase Ib and Phase II portions of the study in order to 
confirm the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy at the venetoclax dose chosen at the end of Phase Ib.  Enrollment will continue while the interim safety analysis is being conducted.   
On the basis of this review, changes may be made to the dose or the dosing schedule of 
the Phase II (see Section 3.2.3). 
3.1.1 Internal Monitoring Commi ttee and Scientific Oversight 
Committee  
An IMC and a SOC will be established to monitor patient safety in both phases of the study.  The IMC and SOC will provide a recommendation for each treatment arm on the venetoclax dose to be taken forward into the Phase II portion of the study after completion of the dose-escalation phase and will provide a further recommendation at the Phase II interim safety analysis on the safety of this dose.  The IMC will include the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor and at least one other medical doctor/Clinical Science representative not directly involved in the study as well as representatives from drug 
safety, biostatistics, and statistical programming and analysis.  The IMC will continue to conduct periodic interim reviews of safety data quarterly during Phase II or more frequently as needed.  The SOC will comprise experts in DLBCL who are investigators for this study in order to provide guidance and a review of safety-related events.  Separate SOC/IMC agreements will outline each committee's composition, meeting timelines, and members' roles and responsibilities.  The committee members will review all potential cases of serious adverse events, Grade 3 and 4 adverse events, and deaths as specified in the SOC/IMC agreement.  The SOC will be kept apprised of all relevant efficacy and safety data from this study and other related clinical trials.  Ad hoc meetings may be called in addition to scheduled meetings as necessary to provide recommendations on management of any new safety issues.  The Sponsor will make 
final decisions regarding protocol procedures and modifications.

The study will consist of two stages:  a dose-finding Phase Ib stage and a Phase II 
expansion stage.  The MTD of venetoclax in  combination with R-CHOP and G-CHOP 
will be determined separately for each arm during the dose-finding stage.  The MTD and dosing schedule for venetoclax for each arm will be used in the Phase II stage for that arm, unless safety or tolerability signals suggest a lower dose will be more appropriate when combining with R-CHOP and G-CHOP.  The study will enroll approximately 
24−60 patients during the dose-finding stage and approximately 180 −200 patients in the 
Phase II portion at approximately 69 investigative sites in North America, the European 
Union, and Asia Pacific. 
Patients will be evaluated for safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of study 
treatment.  Assessments for anti-tumor activity  will be performed following four cycles of 
study treatment (i.e., during Cycle 4, between Days 15 and 21) and at the completion of study treatment. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
64/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 3.1.2 Phase Ib:  Dose-Finding  
Each study arm (R-CHOP in Arm A or G-CHOP in Arm B) will have four dose-finding 
cohorts exploring venetoclax doses and dosing schedules ranging from 200 to 800 mg.  
with a maximum dose administration schedule of 10 days per cycle.   Patients will be 
allocated to a study arm in sequential fashion, starting with Arm A, Cohort 1.  Priority for 
enrollment when more than one arm is open to enrollment will be Arm A followed by Arm B.  In previous studies conducted with single-agent venetoclax, TLS has been observed after the first dose, particularly in patients with CLL at doses ≥
 50 mg/day.  
Clinically significant TLS was not observed in patients with NHL, other than in MCL; therefore, patients with MCL are excluded from this study.  However, TLS is a known risk following initiation of chemotherapy and anti-CD20 therapy in DLBCL.  It is possible that, with the combination of venetoclax and chemoimmunotherapy, an increased rate and severity of TLS could occur.  In order to mitigate the risk for TLS, venetoclax will be initiated following initiation of CHOP (see Section 3.1.2.1).  Additional prophylactic 
measures for mitigating t he risk of TL
S are described in Section 4.4.1.2. 
3.1.2.1 Cohort Dosing Regimen 
Cycle 1 
• Patients in the R-CHOP arm will receive the first rituximab infusion (375 mg/m2), 
administered per package insert (along with standard premedications) on 
Day 1 (Cycle 1 Day 1).  Rituximab administration guidelines are outlined in Section 4.3.2.2. 
• Patients in t he G-CHOP arm will receive their first obinutuzu
mab infusion 
(1000 mg) on Day 1 (Cycle 1 Day 1) along with standard premedication.  During 
Cycle 1, obinutuzumab will also be administered on Days 8 and 15.  Obinutuzumab 
administration guidelines are outlined in Section 4.3.3. 
• Note:  On the basis of a risk assessment for TLS and IRR b
y the investigator, 
patients with high tumor burden or those who cannot tolerate the full dose of rituximab or obinutuzumab in a single day  because of adverse events may receive 
the antibody infusion split over 2 days or re ceive the first cycle as an inpatient, if 
necessary. 
• Following rituximab or obinutuzumab infusion, patients will receive CHOP 
chemotherapy, per standard administration procedures, along with standard premedications (see Section 4.3.4).  Note that the first prednisone dose for each 
cycle should  be administ
ered prior to rituximab or obinutuzumab. 
• Oral dosing of venetoclax will start on Day 4 of the first cycle (Cycle 1 Day 4).  In the 
event that CHOP dosing is delayed (for any  reason), initiation of venetoclax dosing 
should also be delayed and then started 3 days following CHOP.  For example, if CHOP is first administered on Day 2, venetoclax dosing should be started on Day 5.  
Patients will be monitored for signs of acute TLS for at least 8 hours after the 
first venetoclax dose (see Section 4.4.1.2).   
• Oral dosing of venetoclax will then continue thro
ugh Day 10 of Cycle 1 and 
Days 1-10 of Cycles 2 through 8 or alternative dose administration schedules, that 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
65/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 include oral administration of venetoclax on Days 4 −8 in Cycle 1 and Days 1 −5 in 
Cycles 2 −8. 
• Guidelines for TLS prophylaxis were modified for high-risk TLS patients to consider 
starting at a lower dose of venetoclax and reaching the specified dose in a step-wise 
fashion in discussion with the Medical Moni tor to prevent or promptly treat TLS (see 
Section 4.4.1.5) 
 
Cycles 2 −6 
Patients will continue to receive an oral dose of venetoclax on Days 1-10.  On Day 1 of 
each cycle, venetoclax will be administered prior to any infusions.  Rituximab or 
obinutuzumab will be administered on Day 1 along with CHOP per standard administration guidelines.   
Cycles 7 −8 
Patients will continue to receive an oral dose of venetoclax on Days 1-10.  On Day 1 of Cycles 7 and 8, venetoclax will be administered prior to infusion of rituximab or obinutuzumab.  Patients who experience ongoing response without excessive toxicity may receive up to eight cycles of CHOP following discussion between the investigator and the Medical Monitor. 
On days that pre-dose PK sampling is required, venetoclax and prednisone dosing will 
occur in the clinic to facilitate PK sampling. 
Patients should be pre-medicated with antihistamines and acetaminophen 
(corticosteroids if necessary) for rituximab infusion per the package insert, per Section 4.3.3.6 for obinutuzumab infusion, and with anti-emetics and IV 
 hydration per 
institutional policy and standard of practice. 
3.1.2.2 Dose-Escalation Guidelines 
Dosing with venetoclax will begin on Day 4 of Cycle 1 (or 3 days after the first CHOP 
dose, see Section 3.1.2.1) and continue to be administered daily through Day  8 
or Day  10 of
 Cycle 1 and then on  Days 1 −5 or Days 1 −10 for Cycles 2 −8 for up to 
eight 21-day cycles of combination therapy with R-CHOP or G-CHOP.  For each arm, if 
the cohort dosing regimen is determined to be tolerable and to not exceed the MTD (as described in Section 3.1.2.3), dose escalation  of 
 venetoclax will proceed to the 
subsequent cohorts.  All subsequent cohorts will start venetoclax on Day 4 of Cycle 1 (or 3 days after the first CHOP dose; see Section 3.1.2.1 and Figure 2 ).  Venetoclax will 
continue to be administ 
ered at the target cohort dose schedule through Cycle 8 (Cycle 8 
Day 10).

66/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Figure 2 Venetoclax Dose-Finding Cohorts 
 
C = cycle; D  = day; W  = week. 
 
If the administration of venetoclax results in unacceptable toxicity on Days 4 −10 of 
Cycle 1 and Days 1− 10 of Cycles 2-8 schedule or other proposed alternative dose 
administration schedules then alternative dose regimens of venetoclax (e.g., venetoclax 
administered on Days 1–3 or 1–7 of 21) or lower doses of venetoclax may be substituted 
in subsequent cohorts.  If clinically significant TLS is observed at initiation of the administration of venetoclax, alternative doses and dose administration schedules will be explored (e.g., initiate the administration of a lower dose with a gradual dose escalation to the target dose).  If clinically significant TLS is not observed in this study in the initial cohorts then venetoclax dosing starting at Cycle 1 Day 1 or Day 2 may be explored.  If venetoclax dosing starts at Cycle 1 Day 1 or 2 then the DLT observation period would be shortened to one cycle) (see Section 3.4.1.1).  Dose modification of R-CHOP or 
G-CHOP (delays and reductions) be cause of myelosuppression will be made per 
Section 4.5.6
. 
3.1.2.3 Dose-Escalation Rules and Determination of Dose-Limiting 
Toxicity 
The following dose-escalation rules will apply: 
• DLTs in this study are defined as qualifying events occurring during the DLT 
observation period (see Section 3.1.2.4) experienced during combination therapy 
with venetoclax plus R-CHOP or G-CHOP. 
•
 Dose escalation will be pursued using a modified 3  + 3 design.  At least 3 patients 
will be enrolled in each arm per Cohort.  Additional patients may be enrolled at each 
dose level/dose schedule. 
• If none of the first 3 evaluable patie nts experience a DLT during the DLT 
observation period prior to dose escalation (0 of at least 3 patients), then the next 
dose cohort (as described in Section 3.1.2.1) may be evaluated.  Available data 
from all patients receiving study drug will be con s
idered in dose escalation decisions. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
67/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 • If DLT is observed in 1 patient at a given dose level during the DLT observation 
period prior to dose escalation, additional patients will be enrolled at that dose level 
until at least 6 evaluable patients have completed the DLT observation window or 
until a second DLT occurs. 
• If no additional patients experience a DLT during the DLT observation period ( ≤ 1 of 
at least 6 evaluable patients), then the next dose cohort (as described in Section 3.1.2.1) may be evaluated. 
• 
If an additional DLT is observed after expanding beyond 3 evaluable patients 
(≥ 2 DLTs out of at least 6 evaluable patients or in one-third or more of patients if the 
cohort includes more than 6 patients), further enrollment at that dose schedule will be halted and that dose will either be declared as exceeding the MTD or a different dose administration regimen will be implemented, in which case dose escalation 
may resume.  
 
Alternative dose administration regimens (e.g., shorter non-continuous dose 
administration of venetoclax) may be explored, as described in Section 3.1.2.2, 
depending upon the toxicity profile o bserved. 
Dose cohort
s resulting in DLTs in less than one-third of a minimum of 6 patients will be 
considered for further study in the Phase II part of the study. 
The highest (or most dose-intensive) dose adminis tration regimen that results in DLTs in 
less than one-third of a minimum of 6 patients will be declared the MTD. 
3.1.2.4 Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
All adverse events, including DLTs, are to be reported according to instructions in 
Section 5.1.3 and graded according to the National Cancer I nstitute Co mmon 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0).  If a patient experiences a DLT, he or she will be treated according to clinical practice and will be monitored for resolution of the toxicity.  Decrease in B cells, lymphopenia, and leukopenia caused by lymphopenia will not be considered DLTs but instead are 
expected pharmacodynamic outcomes of study treatment.  Any Grade ≥
 3 adverse event 
that is attributed to having a reasonable possibility of being related to the combined administration of venetoclax plus R-CHOP or  G-CHOP, that cannot be attributed by the 
investigator to an alternative, clearly identifiable cause such as tumor progression, concurrent illness or medical condition, or concomitant medication and that occurs 
during the DLT observation period (beginning of venetoclax administration through the end of Cycle 2) will be considered a DLT for dose-escalation purposes.  Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia identified on Day 1 of Cycle 2 or 3, resulting in dose delay is considered a DLT. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
68/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 The following events are exceptions and will not be considered DLTs: 
• Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia, which is an expected outcome of therapy 
• Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia that is not accom panied by temperature elevation (oral or 
tympanic temperature of ≥  100.4°F [38°C]) and improves to Grade ≤  2 (or to ≥  80% 
of the baseline value, whichever is lower) by Day 1 of the next cycle 
• Grade 3 neutropenic fever • Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia as a result of lymphocyte depletion • Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia that does not result in bleeding and improves to 
Grade ≤
 2 (or to ≥  80% of the baseline value, whichever is lower) by Day 1 of the 
next cycle without platelet transfusion 
• Grade 3 or 4 anemia • Grade 3 laboratory TLS without manifestations of clinical TLS (i.e., creatinine 
≥
 1.5 times  the upper limit of normal [ULN] and/or renal dysfunction, cardiac 
arrhythmias, seizures, or sudden death) 
• Grade 3 nausea or vomiting ≤  7 days (in the absence of premedication or that can 
be managed with oral or IV anti-emetics) 
• Reversible Grade 3 infusion related toxicities (including symptoms such as fever, 
chills/rigors, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, headache, rhinitis, rash, and hypotension) 
occurring during or within 24 hours after completing an infusion and resolving within 
24 hours with a reduced infusion rate, supportive care, and/or administration of corticosteroids 
 
If a patient experiences a DLT as described above, the patient will be observed for 
resolution of the toxicity.  If the DLT resolves to Grade ≤
 2 (or ≥  80% of the baseline 
value) within 2 weeks and it is determined to be in the patient’s best interest to continue study treatment (after discussion between the treating investigator and the Medical Monitor), the patient may continue to receive study treatment, provided that the study treatment dose modifications are made as agreed to between the investigator(s) and the Medical Monitor. 
If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia that do not meet the definition of a 
DLT are observed in a patient receiving combination treatment, the patient may continue to receive treatment, provided the neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia has resolved to Grade ≤
 2 (or ≥  80% of the baseline value, whichever is lower) within the time frame 
described above.  Guidelines for dose reducti on of R-CHOP or G-CHOP are provided in 
Section 4.3.3.3. 
3.1.3 Phase II:  Expansion  
The Phase II portion of the study will consist of one cohort for each study arm (R-CHOP and G-CHOP) with the use of the established venetoclax dosing schedule identified during the dose-finding stage for that arm in patients with previously untreated DLBCL.  If both arms are open to Phase II enrollment, patients will be assigned to Arm A 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
69/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 (venetoclax  + R-CHOP) or Arm B (venetoclax  + G-CHOP) through randomization.  If only 
one arm is open to Phase II enrollment at a given time, then patients will be directly 
assigned to the open arm.  The Phase II portion will enroll only patients with previously untreated DLBCL.  Because effects of Bcl-2 inhibition may differ depending on both the level of Bcl-2 expression and the molecular milieu (see Section 1.3), activity of the 
combination will be explored in specific molecula r subsets, 
including Bcl-2 high, Bcl-2 
low, Bcl-2- overexpression and c-Myc overexpression (D E), and GCB and ABC subtypes 
of DLBCL. 
Enrollment into the R-CHOP cohort of patients with both Bcl-2 high and Bcl-2 low 
DLBCL will continue until approximately 50 patients with DE-DLBCL (approximately 
160− 200 patients total; see Section 4.10.6.   Bcl-2 and c-Myc expression analysis results 
will not be r
equired prior to enrolling patients in the Phase II cohorts.  It is estimated that 
approximately 50% of patients with DLBCL w ill have high expression of Bcl-2, and that 
approximately 20% −30% of patients with DLBCL will have high expression of both Bcl-2 
and c-Myc (D E). 
Patients will be monitored for safety and tolerability during the study, including ability to 
maintain relative dose intensity of the chemotherapy (CHOP) backbone.  After 20 patients on Arm A of the Phase II portion of the study have completed the first two cycles of study treatment, an interim safety analysis of all patients treated to date on both the Phase Ib and Phase II portions of the study will be conducted in order to confirm the safety and tolerability of the venetoclax Phase II dose in the combination.  Enrollment will continue while the interim safety analysis is being conducted.  
If there are concerns about the tolerability of the Phase II dose at any time during the 
Phase II study, a lower dose or an alternative dosing schedule for venetoclax
 + R-CHOP 
or G-CHOP may be explored on a case by case basis based on the guideline provided in Section 4.3. 
Disease assessments will be performed 15− 21 days after completion of Cycle 4 dosing 
(interim response asse ssment) and 6 −8 weeks after Day 1 of 
the last cycle received 
(end-of-treatment response).  Thereafter, patients will be followed in the clinic every 
3 months for safety and disease assessments for up to 2 years after the last patient has 
completed  treatment or until death or study termination, whichever occurs first. 
3.1.4 Discontinuation of Veneto clax plus R-CHOP or G-CHOP  
Patients who discontinue venetoclax plus R-CHOP or venetoclax plus G-CHOP for 
reasons other than PD should have a documented response assessment and  continue to 
be followed until disease progression even after institution of alternative therapy.  The se 
patients should continue with follow-up visits every 3 months to collect information on 
disease progression  and /or  initiation of an alternative lymphoma therapy .  After PD, 
patients will also continue to be followed for  OS (see Section 4.5.5). 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
70/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 3.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
3.2.1 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
This study combines treatments that have dem onstrated clinical activity against B-cell 
NHL in general and DLBCL in particular:  R-CHOP chemoimmunotherapy is one of the 
standard treatment regimens for B-cell NHL, and the experimental agent venetoclax is a specific inhibitor of the Bcl-2 anti-apoptot ic protein expressed in many NHL cells.  
Bcl-2 overexpression is likely to play a role in resistance to the pro-apoptotic activities of chemoimmunotherapeutic regimens such as R-CHOP.  In parallel, the substitution of obinutuzumab ⎯a novel anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody  that has shown significant 
promise in B-cell malignancies ⎯for rituximab will be tested in this regimen.  
Obinutuzumab is currently being compared with rituximab in combination with CHOP in a Phase III study in patients with previously untreated DLBCL and if results of this study demonstrate superiority of obinutuzumab, the G-CHOP regimen will be used in future studies of the combination.  The addition of a Bcl-2 inhibitor to R-CHOP or G-CHOP has the potential to significantly enhance the anti-lymphoma activity of the regimen and to result in improved clinical outcomes. 
Nonclinical data support the rationale for improved efficacy and for tolerability, 
respectively, of the combination of R-CHOP and the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL dual inhibitor navitoclax 
(see Section 1.3).  Because venetoclax is a specific inhibitor of Bcl-2 and does not 
appreciably inhibit Bcl-xL, it is pred
icted that dose-limiting thrombocytopenia may be 
avoided or reduced relative to navitoclax, allowing for a potentially greater therapeutic index and increased clinical efficacy compared with either R-CHOP alone or the combination with navitoclax. 
Principal risks identified for the combinat ion regimen of R-CHOP or G-CHOP with 
venetoclax include:  TLS, infusion reactions to rituximab or obinutuzumab, cytopenias, 
(i.e., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or lymphopenia), infections, other malignancies, and drug interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (venetoclax).  In addition, there is a theoretical concern for potentiation of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.  The protocol includes the following features to address these risks: 
• Measures to prevent TLS include use of prophylactic hydration and medication prior 
to initial dosing with careful monitoring during the first 24 hours after dosing for 
metabolic or clinical signs of impending TLS (see Section 4.4.1.5).  In addition, 
dosing of venetoclax will be staggere d; venetoclax dosing will be initiated 3 days 
after the first
 CHOP dose (see Section  3.1.2.1) during the first cycle of 
chemoimmu notherapy in all cohort
s for both R-CHOP and G-CHOP arms.  If 
clinically significant TLS is not observed in this study in the initial cohorts then 
venetoclax dosing starting at Cycle 1 Day 1 or Day 2 may be explored.  Guidelines 
for TLS prophylaxis were modified for high-risk TLS patients to consider starting at a lower dose of venetoclax and reaching the specified dose in a step-wise fashion in 
discussion with the Medical Monitor to prevent or promptly treat TLS 
(see Section 4.4.1.5) 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
71/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 • Prophylactic medication (see Section 4.3.3) will be administered and careful 
monitoring guidelines will be used to 
manage infusion reactions for rituximab or 
obinutuzumab. 
• Frequent blood testing throughout the treatment period will monitor for cytopenias.  
Dose delays or dose reductions are mandated for severe cytopenias.  In addition, all 
supportive measures including transfusion, antibiotics, and the use of growth factors are allowed.  Guidelines for venetoclax dose modification due to thrombocytopenia 
are listed in Section 4.3.6 (see Table 3). 
• Anti-infectio n prophylaxi
s is not mandated for all patients because of the potential 
risks of adding additional concomitant medications but may be prescribed by the 
investigator in specific cases where patients are at especially high risk.  Patients with preexisting infections are excluded from the study to avoid reactivation.  
Neutropenia will be closely monitored and may be treated with growth factors, and 
any signs of infection will be treated with appropriate medication. 
• Guidelines for concomitant medications to avoid or use with caution are provided in 
view of the possible drug-drug interactions (see Appendix 5 ). 
 
The venetoclax
 + R-CHOP or G-CHOP treatment combinations are expected to be 
associated with toxicities that can largely be managed (e.g., first-dose TLS and infusion 
reactions) or that are commonly encountered with the treatment of NHL and that can be mitigated with the measures outlined in this protocol.  In particular, infection and cytopenias are common during the treatment of NHL with chemoimmunotherapy as a result of myelosuppressive effects of the treatment.  The potential advantage of this regimen is that the addition of a Bcl-2 inhibitor may facilitate targeted cell killing of high-Bcl-2 expressing NHL cells without the need to further increase myelosuppression over what is observed with R-CHOP. 
As discussed in Section  1.1.2, although DLBCL is curable in many patien
 ts, those who 
are not cured have extremely poor outcomes, arguing for urgent incorporation of novel 
therapies.  Because the likelihood of curing DLBCL is known to be impacted by maintenance of dose intensity of standard chemotherapy, dose intensity will be monitored on a regular basis by the IMC/SOC (see Section 4.10.4.2), and evidence of 
excessive dose delays or reduction
s would prompt modification of the trial. 
Because many patients with B-cell NHL are not cured with standard therapy, the benefit of a novel therapy with the potential to  evade chemotherapy resistance through the 
incorporation of the Bcl-2 inhibitor outweighs the risks expected from this combination regimen and supports initiation of this Phase Ib/II study. 
3.2.2 Rationale for Venetoclax Dose Selection in the Phase I Portion 
of the Study  
Venetoclax dosing for this study was determined on the basis of the experience from the Phase I study (Study M12-175) with single-agent venetoclax in relapsed/refractory patients with NHL.  This study explored a step-up dosing schedule in order to safely 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
72/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 administer venetoclax by reducing the risk for TLS showing safety of initial doses of up 
to 400 mg without clinically significant TLS in NHL.  Final target doses of up to 800 mg have been shown to be tolerable in patients with CLL.  Patients with NHL have received final target doses of 1200 mg without DLTs.  The starting dose will be 200 mg.  Subsequent dose cohorts will explore progressively higher starting and target doses up to a final dose of 800 mg, if tolerated.  Given that venetoclax will be administered in conjunction with R-CHOP or G-CHOP chemoimmunotherapy, which on its own has a degree of myelosuppression, venetoclax dosed up to the MTD achieved as monotherapy may not be tolerable in this combination.  The number of cycles of dosing (eight 3-week cycles) is designed to provide treatment duration consistent with other therapies for NHL that have been shown to be sufficient to provide durable responses. 
3.2.3 Rationale for Venetoclax Dose Selection in the Phase II Portion 
of the Study  
As per study design description (see Section 3.1), the MTD and dosing schedule for 
venetoclax for each arm will be used in the Phase II stage for
 that arm, unless safety or 
tolerability signals suggest a lower dose would be more appropriate when combined with R-CHOP and G-CHOP.   
In the Phase Ib dose-escalation portion of the study, none of the dose levels studied 
exceeded the MTD on the non-continuous dosing schedule.  Since no MTD could be identified at any dose-level tested, and since it was considered unlikely that higher doses of venetoclax would provide an improved benefi t/risk profile, on the basis of the data 
from the other clinical studies of venetoclax in NHL, the 800-mg dose was selected for the R-CHOP arm.   
Overall, the combination of R-CHOP with venetoclax administered on the 
non-continuous schedule was well tolerated.  However, two adverse events were noted to occur at increased frequency than would be expected with R-CHOP alone and were likely because of the combination therapy:  diarrhea and thrombocytopenia.  These toxicities were adequately managed with medical intervention and dose interruptions, but following review by the IMC/SOC, further dose escalation was not felt to be indicated.  Guidelines for management of these events are provided in Table 3 and Section 4.4.1.8 .  
Therefore, on the basis 
of safety and tolerability observed in patients tre
ated in the 
dose-escalation portion of the study, the Phase II venetoclax dose for Arm A (venetoclax
 + R-CHOP) is 800 mg on a non-continuous dosing schedule of Cycle 1 
Days 4 −10 and Cycles 2 −8 Days 1 −10.  In M12-175 (singe agent venetoclax) study 
responses were observed in DLBCL with single agent venetoclax doses that range from 600 mg to 1200 mg with no evidence of improved responses at doses higher than 600 mg.   
In order to confirm that the Phase II dose is safe and tolerable, a safety interim analysis 
will be performed after 20 patients enrolled in Phase II Arm A have completed two cycles 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
73/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 of combination therapy.  During this analysis, data will be reviewed for all patients in both 
arms enrolled in the study in order to assess safety and tolerability of the combination in a larger number of patients.  In addition, review of data from patients treated on the Phase Ib portion of the study will allow assessment of longer-term tolerability of the combination throughout the planned treatment course, including incidence of dose delays or dose reductions in later cycles.  Enrollment will continue while the interim safety analysis is being conducted.   
An IMC and SOC (see Section 3.1.1) will meet to review safety data for all patients 
treated in both the Phase Ib and Phase II portions of the study in order to confirm the 
safety and tolerability of the combination therapy at the Phase II dose.  Given the results from this analysis, the Sponsor may decide to decrease the dose or the dosing schedule of the Phase II part of the study. 
In addition, the SOC and the IMC will conduct periodic interim reviews of safety data 
during Phase II (see Section 3.1.1).  Given the results from these reviews, the Sponsor 
may decide to decrease the dose or dosing schedule of the Phase II part of the study. 
On 17 July 2016, Roche/Genentech as th e sponsor of Study BO21005 (Goya study), a 
Phase III study that evaluated G 
CHOP versus R-CHOP in 1L DLBCL, informed 
through a press release that the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS was not 
met.  Given these results, Arm B (venetoclax  + G-CHOP) will not be expanded in Phase 
II in patients who are first-line with DLBCL. 
3.2.4 Rationale for R-CHOP Dosing  
R-CHOP will be administered at standard dose on a standard 21-day cycle schedule.  CHOP chemotherapy will be given for six cycles , with eight total cycles of rituximab 
(Pfreundschuh et al. 2008 ).  Six cycles of CHOP chemotherapy have been chosen for 
this study on the basis of National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the United States.  However, because global standards of care differ when a 21-day schedule for R-CHOP is used and because no comparative data regarding number of cycles are available using R-CHOP −21, patients who experience ongoing response 
without excessive toxicity may receive up to eight cycles of CHOP following discussion between the investigator and the Medical Monitor. 
3.2.5 Rationale for G-CHOP Dosing  
G-CHOP is being studied in two ongoing clinical studies in patients with DLBCL.  In both studies, CHOP is administered at standard doses and schedule.  The dose and schedule for obinutuzumab in this regimen is 1000 mg on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each cycle thereafter for a total of eight cycles of obinutuzumab.  This dose and schedule were chosen for the following reasons: 
• In Study BO20999, patients were randomized to two different obinutuzumab dose 
cohorts.  In the low-dose (LD) cohort, patients received eight cycles of 400 mg of 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
74/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 obinutuzumab, with an additional 400-mg dose given on Day 8 of the first cycle.  In 
the HD cohort, obinutuzumab was given at 1600 mg on Days 1 and 8 of the 
first cycle, followed by 800 mg at Cycles 2 −8.  No DLTs were observed between the 
two doses and, although there was a slight increase of IRRs and neutropenia rates 
in the HD cohort, obinutuzumab was generally very well tolerated.  As expected, PK 
variability was lower at the higher dose.  Importantly, an increased overall response 
rate was observed in the HD cohort compared with the LD cohort (55% vs. 13%, respectively) in the subset of patients with indolent lymphoma and a trend toward 
better response rates in the HD cohort was observed in patients with aggressive 
lymphomas, arguing that a higher dose is more effective and not significantly more toxic. 
• In the HD cohort of Study BO20999, the first two doses of obinutuzumab were set at 
1600 mg.  Although well tolerated by patients, the dose administration scheme 
resulted in dose administration times of ≥
 5 hours.  With the goal of maintaining the 
loading dose concept and to provide a signi ficant amount of antibody early in the 
treatment course, it was decided to split the obinutuzumab dose administration and to change the schedule and dose during the first 2 weeks of any future studies from 
1600 mg administered on Days 1 and 8 to 1000 mg administered on Days 1, 8, and 15.  This dosing regimen may provide comparably fast rising PK exposure and 
early target saturation, while avoiding the practical challenges of delivering 1600 mg 
of drug in a single day together with chemotherapy.  The dose administered for subsequent cycles is also set at 1000 mg.  This dose and schedule will result in an 
obinutuzumab exposure of 3000 mg during the first 2 weeks for a cumulative 
exposure of 10,000 mg and is therefore very close to the regimen that has delivered the best results thus far for obinutuzumab in both indolent and aggressive 
lymphoma.  There is no indication that the additional obinutuzumab doses 
administered on Days 8 and 15 in the first cycle would negatively affect the safety of patients. 
 
Results reported to date in these ongoing studies suggest that this dose administration 
schedule is tolerable.  In order to maintain consistency with these studies, the same dosing schedule will be administered in the current study. 
3.2.6 Rationale for Dosing Schedule  
Both venetoclax plus R-CHOP/G-CHOP demonstrate rapid response of malignant and normal peripheral B lymphocytes after initial administration.  TLS has been observed following initiation of both R-CHOP and venetoclax in both FL and DLBCL, but the frequency and severity of TLS related to venetoclax is expected to be less than that seen with CLL.  Staggered dosing of venetoclax will be administered, as described in Section 3.1.2.2.  If clinically significa nt TLS is no
 t observed in this study in the initial 
cohorts then venetoclax dosing starting at Cycle 1 Day 1 or Day 2 may be explored. Patients will receive TLS prophylaxis with hydration and a uric acid-lowering agent at least 72 hours prior to the first dose of v enetoclax.  The venetoclax dose administration 
schedule was changed to administering venetoclax in Cycle 1 on Days 4 −10 and 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
75/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Cycles 2 −8 on Days 1− 10 due to as a result of toxicities observed in the first cohort of 
200 mg of venetoclax under continual daily dosing.   
3.2.7 Rationale for Treatment of Pa tients with Previously Untreated 
DLBCL 
DLBCL is potentially curable, with approx imately 60% of patients having long-term 
remissions following standard treatment with R-CHOP.  Patients with intermediate to 
high risk by the IPI have a lower chance of cure with R-CHOP therapy than those with low IPI, and patients who relapse or are refractory to R-CHOP have very poor outcomes, with most dying within 2 years ( Gisselbrecht et al. 2010 ).  Better treatments are urgently 
needed for t hese patient
s.  Bcl-2 is overexpressed in most DLBCL and likely plays a role 
in resistance.  Therefore, exploring this combination in first-line DLBCL is compelling.  Given the potential for cure of these patients with standard therapy and the importance of maintaining dose and schedule of R-CHOP, a critical issue in exploring the combination with venetoclax is to minimize the chance for dose delays or reductions.  It is critical to explore the tolerability of this combination in the proposed Phase II cohorts in order to demonstrate the feasibility of dose maintenance before embarking on a large Phase III study in the future. 
3.2.8 Rationale for Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
The risk of clinically significant PK drug inte raction between venetoclax, rituximab, or 
obinutuzumab and CHOP is expected to be low on the basis of their metabolic pathways.  Venetoclax is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9.  Rituximab and obinutuzumab are biologics administered intravenously and are not expected to modulate CYP3A4 activity and affect venetoclax metabolism.  Prednisone has been implicated as potential weak CYP3A4 inducer and/or an inducer of P-gp, which could result in reduced venetoclax concentrations depending on the prednisone dose and timing relative to venetoclax administration and the duration of the induction effect after prednisone dosing is stopped. 
Rituximab and obinutuzumab have decreased clearance with time that may be related to 
CD20 target expression and tumor burden.  Venetoclax may affect the clearance of rituximab and obinutuzumab because it has the potential to decrease tumor burden.  PK samples for rituximab and obinutuzumab will be collected to assess whether drug levels differ from the combination compared with historical data to check for potential drug-drug interactions. 
Drug-drug interaction potential between venetoclax and prednisone will also be explored 
in this study.  PK samples for prednisone will be collected on Cycle 1 Day 1 (before administration of venetoclax) and Cycle 2 Day 1 (when administered with venetoclax). 
PK samples to assess the plasma/serum levels of venetoclax, rituximab, obinutuzumab, 
and CHOP components will be collected according to the schedule in Appendix 3 .  
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
76/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Alternative PK assessments may be explored if there is substantial difficulty in obtaining 
the time points listed in Appendix 3 . 
3.2.9 Rationale for Collecting Tumor Biopsies and Peripheral Blood 
for Biomarker Studies  
DE-DLBCL, defined as Bcl-2 high and c-Myc high protein, are associated with poor 
outcomes in DLBCL.  Identifying these D E patients is a primary objective of this study.  It 
is estimated that approximately 50% of pati ents with DLBCL will have high expression of 
Bcl-2, and that approximately 20% −30% of patients with DLBCL will have high 
expression of both Bcl-2 and c-Myc (D E).  Bcl-2 is also associated with poor prognosis 
(Iqbal et al. 2011 ).  The t(14;18) translocation, which place s  the BCL2 gene under the 
control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer, is found in the GCB subtype of DLBCL; amplification of the 18q21 locus where the BCL2 gene resides are found in the 
ABC subtype.  Together, somatic genetic aberrations are found in 30% −40% of patients 
with DLBCL, and whereas, both result in overexpression of Bcl-2 at the mRNA and protein levels, Bcl-2 expression is associated with a poorer prognosis in the GCB subtype.  Therefore, the efficacy of therapy in high Bcl-2 (Bcl-2 positive) and in different 
prognostic subgroups, including ABC/GCB, will be important to help identify the target population for Phase III that will most likely benefit from venetoclax in combination with R-CHOP or G-CHOP. 
Venetoclax inhibits the ability of cancer cells to evade cell death, or apoptosis, by 
blocking the activity of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.  Nonclinical studies have demonstrated a pattern of response to venetoclax on the basis of genetic aberrations in Bcl-2, Bcl-2 protein levels, and the levels of Bcl-2 family proteins ( Souers et al. 2013).  
High levels of Bcl-2 and low levels of Mcl-1 are generally predictive of re sponse to 
Bcl-2 inhibit
ors in vitro ( Mérino et al. 2012), and loss of expression of proteins involved in 
mitochondrial apoptosis and/or upregulation of Mcl-1 is associated with 
resistance.  
In addition, high levels of at least one pro-apoptotic “sensor,” such as Noxa or Bim, is required.  The following relevant DNA, RNA, and proteins (including Bcl-2 and prognostic subgroups) will be measured at baseline to identify biomarkers that predict efficacy and, when available, also at relapse to understand mechanisms of resistance: 
• Bcl-2 and c-Myc protein expression by IHC 
• Bcl-2 and Bcl-2 family protein expression by IHC 
• BCL2 and c-MYC copy number gain by FISH and translocation t(14;18) by FISH 
• Expression of transcripts for BCL2 family members, other apoptotic genes, and 
genes associated with the ABC or GCB subtypes of DLBCL 
• Subgroups relevant to DLBCL biology that are defined genetically or by poor 
prognosis including CD79b, Myd88, CARD11, TNFAIP3, epigenetic markers, and 
MYC translocation 
MRD may have prognostic value in DLBCL.  In patients with an identifiable IgH 
rearrangement, clonal IgH rearrangements may be used as a marker of MRD.  In 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
77/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 the Phase II portion of this study, peripheral blood samples will be collected for MRD 
at baseline, Cycle 4 Day 1, 6 −8 weeks following Cycle 8 Day 1, and every 3 months 
during follow-up for 1 year.   
 
The following samples will be collected to enable the evaluation of the parameters listed 
above: 
• A tumor biopsy sample (either archival or fresh) must be collected from all patients.  
The tumor specimen must contain adequate evaluable tumor cells to enable Bcl-2 
IHC and other relevant biomarker analysis.  Samples can be in a tissue block 
(preferred) or prepared as 20 unstained serial slides, and should be accompanied 
by an associated pathology report.  The specimen must be a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimen, or another appropriate fixative must be used 
(notation of the type of fixative should be included).  Cytological or fine-needle 
aspiration as well as bone marrow samples are not acceptable. 
• In the Phase II portion of this study, a tissue punch sample must be collected from 
the tissue block in patients who have an excisional biopsy sample available. 
• The tissue punch must be submitted to the pathology central laboratory for 
construction of tissue microarrays (TMAs).  Instructions for tissue punch will be provided in the laboratory manual. 
• An FFPE  tumor biopsy sample must be collected at disease progression and sent to 
the central laboratory to evaluate venetoclax resistance mechanisms.   The sample 
must be a tissue block or 20 unstained serial slides.  
• Blood collection to evaluate blood-based approaches to classification of ABC/GCB 
and other DLBCL subgroups 
• Plasma collection at Baseline, Cycle 5, and at relapse to evaluate circulating tumor 
markers that could be associated with response/resistance including but not limited to mutations in BCL2  
 
3.3 OUTCOME MEASURES 
3.3.1 Safety Outcome Measures  
The safety and tolerability of the combination of venetoclax plus R-CHOP or G-CHOP 
will be assessed using the following primary safety outcome measure: 
• Incidence and nature of combination DLTs 
 
In addition, safety will be assessed using the following secondary safety outcome 
measures: 
• Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events and serious adverse events 
graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0.  Adverse events of special interest include

signs 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
78/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 • Maintenance of relative dose intensity of CHOP chemotherapy 
 
3.3.2 Pharmacokinetic Outcome Measures  
The following PK parameters will be derived from the plasma concentration-time profile 
of prednisone, venetoclax, and relevant metabolites following administration when appropriate, as data allow: 
• Total plasma exposure (AUC) 
• Time to maximum observed plasma concentration (t
max) 
• C max in plasma 
• Minimum plasma concentration under steady-state conditions within a dosing 
interval (C min) in plasma 
 
The following PK parameters will be determined from the concentration-time profiles of 
rituximab, obinutuzumab, and CHO components, as applicable: 
• C max in serum or plasma, as appropriate 
• C min in serum or plasma, as appropriate 
 
Other PK parameters such as clearance, volume of distribution (V), and half-life may 
also be calculated as data allow. 
3.3.3 Efficacy Outcome Measures  
The following activity outcome measures will be assessed: 
• Primary outcome measures: 
CR, as defined by PET-CT scan as well as bone marrow examination when

3.4 SAFETY PLAN 
Patients who are enrolled in this study will be carefully monitored during the entire study, 
and any new information from this and other studies will be communicated to sites and 
will result in protocol modifications as necessary to ensure appropriate risk-mitigation procedures.  Safety evaluations will consist of medical interviews, collection of adverse event information, physical examinations, vita l sign assessments, and laboratory tests, 
including hematologic, biochemical, and immunologic assessments.  Patients will be evaluated for adverse events at each study visit through 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax study treatment or the last dose of CHOP or 90 days after the last rituximab or obinutuzumab study treatment, whichever is later. 
During the dose-finding stage, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Sponsor) will hold 
teleconferences with investigators for evaluation of each dose level to review toxicities.  Additional ad hoc teleconferences will be held as necessary to discuss any ongoing issues regarding toxicity or study conduct.  In addition, an IMC and SOC will be established to review all safety data and make recommendations regarding dose selection of venetoclax.  Access to safety data will be available to the Medical Monitor via the electronic data capture (EDC) syst em.  All serious adverse events will be 
reviewed by the Medical Monitor within 24 −48 hours after reporting, and serious, 
unexpected, related adverse events will be re viewed for regulatory reporting purposes.  
Regular teleconferences will be held with investigators, study sites, and the Medical Monitor to review toxicities observed in patients in the study and to discuss decisions regarding dose and schedule modifications. 
During the Phase II portion of the study, all patients will continue to be monitored for 
safety and tolerability.  Precautionary safety measures and regular monitoring of safety by an IMC and the Sponsor enable early identification of safety signals in the study and minimize the risk to patient enrolled.  An IMC/SOC Agreement will be developed to establish the detailed roles and responsibilities of the IMC and the SOC. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd

3.4.1 Risks Associated with Ve netoclax and Their Management  
The clinical safety profile of venetoclax based on clinical data obtained in the ongoing 
Phase I studies is summarized in Section 1.2.2.3.  On the basis of clinica l  data to date, 
the known and suspected risks are described below.  Guidelines around the management of these risks through dose and schedule modifications are described in Section 4.3.6.  See the ABT-199/GDC-0199 Investigator’s Brochure for complete and 
updated det ails. 
3.4.1.1 Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
The principal DLT associated with venetoclax in the ongoing Phase I Study M12-175 to date has been TLS (in patients with CLL/SLL), primarily, but not exclusively related to 
the first dose. 
Experience from the Phase I study has suggeste d that clinically significant TLS is less 
common in NHL than in CLL; however, laboratory TLS has been observed in some 
patients with NHL.  The combination of venetoclax with effective chemotherapy and a monoclonal antibody, which may also cause TLS in patients with NHL, raises the possibility of more significant occurrences of TLS.  All patients must receive hydration and an agent to reduce uric acid as TLS prophylaxis at least 72 hours prior to starting venetoclax treatment.  Laboratory testing is required after initial dosing to monitor for metabolic changes and will be used to assess the need for closer monitoring and hospitalization for IV hydration and treatment of metabolic abnormalities caused by rapid cell lysis.  Hospitalization will be required at initial venetoclax dosing for patients who are determined to be at high risk of TLS as a result of bulky disease (i.e., any lymphoma 
mass
 ≥ 10 cm  and/or evidence of circulating lymphoma cells ).  See Section 4.4.1.5 for 
details of the TLS prophylaxis and monitoring schedule to be
 used for initial dosing. 
3.4.1.2 Cytopenias 
Lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia have been reported in the 
Phase I study conducted in heavily pretreated patients with CLL and NHL.  In certain cases, the condition was preexisting.  In this study, blood counts will be monitored closely throughout treatment.  Growth factors are permitted according to local practice, and patients will be monitored and treated promptly in case of infections (see Section 4.4.1.3).  Blood counts that meet DLT re quirements will result 
 in dose changes.  
It is recommended that blood counts be checked within 24-72 hours for patients with cytopenias that result in dose delays to see if the counts have recovered. 
3.4.1.3 Infections 
Infections of various types have occurred in patients in the Phase I study.  NHL can be associated with impaired immune function and increased infections, and it is unclear whether or how much the incidence could be increased as a result of venetoclax treatment.  Patients in this study will be closely monitored for infections, and 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
81/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 prompt therapy will be instituted, as nece ssary.  Patients are allowed to receive 
concomitant prophylactic anti-infective therapy at the investigator’s discretion (see 
Section 4.4.1.6). 
3.4.1.4 Decreased Spermatogenesis 
There is a potential for decreased spermatogenesis without recovery with the use of venetoclax.  Male patients considering preservation of fertility should bank sperm before treatment. 
3.4.1.5 Drug-Drug Interaction 
Co-administration of venetoclax with strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see Appendix 5  for examples) is not reco mmended.  
 Consider alternative medications.  If the 
patient requires use of these medications, use with caution and reduce the venetoclax dose by 2-fold for moderate inhibitors and 4-fold for strong inhibitors during co-administration. 
If the patient requires use of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers (see Appendix 5  for 
examples), use with cau tion and con
tact the Medical Monitor for guidance. 
3.4.2 Risks Associated with Rituximab Therapy and Their 
Management  
3.4.2.1 Infusion-Related Reactions 
In single-agent clinical studies of rituximab and in post-marketing surveillance studies, 
mild to moderate IRRs consisting of fever and chills/rigors occurred in the majority of patients during the first rituximab infusion.  Other frequent IRR signs and symptoms included nausea, pruritus, angioedema, asthenia, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, throat irritation, rhinitis, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, dizziness, and hypertension.  These reactions generally occurred within 30 −120 minutes of beginning 
the first infusion, and they resolved with slowing or interruption of the rituximab infusion and with supportive care (diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, IV saline, meperidine, and vasopressors).  The incidence of IRRs was highest during the first infusion and decreased with each subsequent infusion. 
Rituximab has caused severe IRRs.  In some cases, these reactions were fatal.  These 
severe reactions typically occurred during the first infusion with time to onset of 30-120 minutes.  Signs and symptoms of severe IRRs may include urticaria, hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia, or bronchospasm and may require interruption of rituximab administration.  The most severe manifestations and sequelae include pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, and anaphylactic and anaphylactoid events (see Appendix 4 ).  Approximately 80% of fatal I RRs occurred in asso
 ciation with the first 
infusion of rituximab. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
82/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 3.4.2.1.1 Management of Sever e Infusion-Related Reactions 
Administration of rituximab will occur in a setting with emergency equipment and staff 
who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.  The rituximab infusion should be interrupted for severe reactions.  Medications and supportive care measures  including but not limited to epinephrine, antihistamines, glucocorticoids, 
IV fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, and acetaminophen  should be 
available for immediate use and instituted as m edically indicated for use in the event of a 
reaction during administration.  In most cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g., from 100 mg/hr to 50 mg/hr) when symptoms have completely resolved.  Patients who require close monitoring during the first and all subsequent infusions include patients with preexisting cardiac and pulmonary conditions, patients with prior clinically significant  cardiopulmonary adverse events, and patients 
with high numbers of circulating malignant cells ( ≥
 25,000  cells /μL) with or without 
evidence of high tumor burden. 
3.4.2.2 Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Rapid reductions in tumor volume followed by acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, or hype rphosphatemia have been reported within 
12-24 hours after the first infusion of rituximab.  Rare instances of a fatal outcome have been reported in the setting of TLS following treatment with rituximab.  The risks of TLS appear to be greater in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells 
(≥
 25,000  cells /μL) or high tumor burden.  Prophylaxis for TLS including hydration and 
administration of a uric acid −lowering agent is required in this study for all patients.  A 
lower starting dose of venetoclax may be used in high-risk TLS patients (see 
Section 4.4.1.5).  Patients deemed to be at high risk for TLS complication s may, at the 
investigator’s discretion, receive their initial dose of rituximab over 2 consecutive days (see Section 4.3.2.3).  Correction of electrolyte a bnormalities, monitoring of renal 
function and 
 fluid balance, and administration of supportive care, including dialysis, 
should be initiated as indicated.  Following complete resolution of the complications of TLS, rituximab has been tolerated when re-administered in conjunction with prophylactic therapy for TLS in a limited number of cases. 
3.4.2.3 Hepatitis B Reactivation with  Related Fulminant Hepatitis and 
Other Viral Infections 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported for some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab.  The majority of these patients received rituximab in combination with 
chemotherapy ( Yeo et al. 2009). 
All patients will be scree ned for HBV infection by 
 measuring hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg), total anti-hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc), and total anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies before initiating treatment with rituximab or obinutuzumab.  For patients who show evidence of prior hepatitis B infection (i.e., with positive total hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb], negative HBsAg and undetectable HBV DNA), a consult is 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
83/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 required with a physician who has expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding 
monitoring and consideration for HBV antiviral  therapy.  These patients will be monitored 
for clinical and laboratory signs of hepatitis or HBV reactivation during and for several months following rituximab therapy (see Section 4.4.1.7).  HBV reactivation has been 
reported up to 24 months following completion of therapy.  In patients wh o develop 
reactivation 
of HBV while on rituximab, immediately discontinue rituximab and any 
concomitant chemotherapy and institute appropriate treatment (see Table 3).  
Insufficient data exist regarding the safety 
of resuming rituximab or obinutuzumab in 
patients who develop HBV reactivation. 
Additional serious viral infections, either new, reactivated, or exacerbated 
(e.g., infections caused by cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, West Nile virus, parvovirus B19, John Cunningham [JC] virus, and hepatitis C virus) have been reported with rituximab, mainly in patients who had received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  The risk of such infections with rituximab in combination with chemotherapy and venetoclax is unknown.  Particular attention should be given to patients who have had significant prior immunosuppressive treatment such as HD chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.  JC virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and death has been observed in rituximab-treated patients with hematologic malignancies or with autoimmune diseases.  Most cases of PML were diagnosed within 12 months following the patient’s last infusion of rituximab.  Physicians should consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset neurologic manifestations.  
Evaluation of PML includes but is not limited to consultation with a neurologist, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and lumbar puncture.  Physicians should discontinue rituximab or obinutuzumab (and chemotherapy and venetoclax) and consider discontinuation or reduction of any  immunosuppressive therapy in patients who 
develop PML. 
3.4.2.4 Cardiovascular Events 
Infusions should be discontinued in the event of serious or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.  Patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias should undergo cardiac monitoring during and after subsequent infusions of rituximab.  Patients with preexisting cardiac conditions including arrhythmias and angina have had recurrences of these events during rituximab therapy and should be monitored throughout the infusion and during the immediate post-infusion period. 
3.4.2.5 Bowel Obstruction and Perforation 
Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, and perforation, in some cases leading to death, were observed in patients who received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy for DLBCL.  In post-marketing reports, which include patients with low-grade or follicular NHL and patients with DLBCL, the mean time to onset of symptoms was 6 days (range, 1 −77 days) in patients with documented gastrointestinal perforation.  Complaints 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
84/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 of abdominal pain, especially early in the course of treatment, should prompt a thorough 
diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment. 
3.4.2.6 Immunization 
The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following rituximab therapy has not been studied.  Patients who participate in this study may not receive either primary or booster vaccination with live virus vaccines for at least 6 months prior to initiation of rituximab or at any time during study treatment.  Investigators should review the vaccination status of potential study patients being considered for this study and follow the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for adult vaccination with non-live vaccines intended to prevent infect ious diseases prior to study therapy.

3.4.3 Risks Associated wi th Obinutuzumab Therapy  
There may be additional potential health risks, including hitherto unknown risks, derived from exposure to obinutuzumab. 
3.4.3.1 Infusion-Related Reactions and Hypersensitivity Reactions 
(Including Anaphylaxis) 
The commonly experienced IRRs associated with obinutuzumab are characterized by hypotension, fever, chills, flushing, nausea, vomiting, hypertension, and fatigue, among other symptoms.  IRRs may be clinically i ndistinguishable from IgE-mediated allergic 
reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis).  IRRs generally appear early during the infusion or shortly after, or in some cases, up to 24 hours after the completion of obinutuzumab infusion.  Some patients have developed severe IRRs resulting in permanent discontinuation of obinutuzumab.  In some instances, concurrent signs of TLS are observed. 
In the majority of patients, IRRs were mild or moderate and could be managed by the 
slowing or temporary halting of the first infusion, but severe and life-threatening IRRs that required symptomatic treatment have also been reported. 
Respiratory infusion-related symptoms such  as hypoxia, dyspnea, bronchospasm, larynx 
and throat irritation, and laryngeal edema have also been reported.  These IRRs were 
mostly mild or moderate (NCI CTCAE v4.0, Grade 1 and 2 events), and <
 10% of the 
events were severe (Grade 3 events), occurring predominantly during the first hour of the infusion or shortly after the first infusion had finished; the events resolved with slowing or interruption of the infusion and supportive care.  The incidence and severity of IRRs decreased with subsequent infusions.  Extensive tumor burden predominantly localized in the blood circulation (e.g., high peripheral lymphocyte count in patients with CLL) may be a predisposing factor for the development of IRRs. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
85/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Hypersensitivity may be difficult to distinguish from IRRs; however, anaphylaxis has 
been reported in patients treated with obinutuzumab.  If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected during infusion (e.g., symptoms ty pically occurring after previous exposure 
and very rarely with the first infusion), the infusion should be stopped and treatment permanently discontinued.  Patients with known IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to 
obinutuzumab should not be treated. 
3.4.3.2 Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Cases of TLS have been reported with obinutuzumab administration.  To date, no patient has required hemodialysis for renal failure.  Patients with a high tumor burden, including patients with a lymphocyte count of ≥
 25  × 109/L (particularly, patients with 
B-cell CLL and MCL), are at increased risk for TLS and severe IRRs. 
3.4.3.3 Thrombocytopeni a and Neutropenia 
Severe and life-threatening thrombocytopenia, including acute thrombocytopenia, (occurring within 24 hours after the infusion) has been observed during treatment with obinutuzumab.  Fatal hemorrhagic events have also been reported in patients treated with obinutuzumab.  The greatest risk of hemorrhage in obinutuzumab-treated patients seems to be during the first cycle, although a clear relationship between thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic events has not been established.  Patients treated with concomitant medication that could possibly worsen thrombocytopenia-related events, such as platelet inhibitors and anticoagulants, may be at greater risk of bleeding.  Patients should be closely monitored for thrombocytopenia, especially during the first cycle.  If an event of thrombocytopenia occurs, regular laboratory tests should be performed until the event resolves, and dose delays should be considered in case of 
severe or life-threatening thrombocytopenia.  Transfusion of blood products (i.e., platelet transfusion) may be performed at the discretion of the treating physician according to institutional practice. 
Cases of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia, have been reported 
with obinutuzumab administration.  Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia has been observed predominantly in patients with CLL.  Patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia should be monitored until neutrophil values return to at least Grade 2 or baseline.  Use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been found to result in a rapid normalization of neutrophils, similar to what has been observed in patients treated with rituximab (see Section 4.4.1.3). 
3.4.3.4 Anti-Therapeutic Antibody 
Although obinutuzumab is a fully humanized antibody , there is a risk that anti-therapeutic 
antibodies could develop, thus reducing e fficacy and/or resulting in symptomatic 
hypersensitivity reactions.  Experienc e with similar humanized antibodies 
(e.g., trastuzumab) suggests that the incidence and titer of such antibodies will be low and will be unlikely to affect efficacy or cause unwanted immunological reactions (Genentech data on file). 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
86/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 3.4.3.5 Infection 
On the basis of its anticipated mode of action that results in profound B-cell depletion, 
obinutuzumab may be associated with an increased risk of infections.  Infections have been reported in patients who received obinutuzumab.  Therefore, obinutuzumab should not be administered to patients with active severe infections. 
Serious infections, including fatal bacterial, fungal, and new or reactivated viral infections 
(e.g., cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis B or C) have been reported with the B cell −depleting antibody 
rituximab, mainly in patients who had received the drug in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  The risk of such 
infections with obinutuzumab is unknown.  Physicians should be aware of symptoms suggestive of PML and consider the diagnosis of PML in any patient presenting with new-onset neurologic manifestations.  Evaluation of PML includes but is not limited to consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture. 
3.4.3.6 Gastrointestinal Perforation 
Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation has been reported in patients treated with obinutuzumab including fatal events.  Patients with GI involvement should be monitored for signs of GI perforation. 
3.4.4 Risks Associated with CHOP Chemotherapy  
Refer to prescribing information for doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone or prednisolone for risks related to CHOP chemotherapy. 
Common side effects of CHOP include fever, infection, hair loss, nausea and/or vomiting, 
constipation, and potential neurologic, lung, liver, and cardiac toxicity.  Patients treated with doxorubicin, an anthracycline-based chemotherapy, are at risk for cardiotoxicity.  Although the risk increases with cumulative dose, irreversible cardiotoxicity may occur at any dose level.  Patients with preexisting heart disease, hypertension, concurrent administration of other anti-neoplastic agents, prior or concurrent chest irradiation, and advanced age are at increased risk. 
3.4.5 Risks Associated with the Combination of Venetoclax plus  
R-CHOP or G-CHOP  
This Phase Ib/II study will assess the toxicities associated with the combination of venetoclax plus R-CHOP or G-CHOP.  Given their mechanisms of action and single-agent safety profiles, additive or overlapping acute toxicities for the combination of venetoclax plus R-CHOP or G-CHOP could potentially include neutropenia and TLS.  The risk of TLS will be mitigated by starting treatment with one agent before the other, to allow some reduction of disease burden before the second agent is added.  In addition, patients will receive hydration and TLS prophylaxis prior to initial dosing (see Section 4.4.1.5). 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
87/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 In terms of chronic toxicity, it is theoretically possible that inhibition of Bcl-2 could 
enhance and/or prolong neutropenia and lymphopenia following completion of R-CHOP or G-CHOP treatment.  These effects, if t hey occur, could likely manifest as an 
increased incidence of infections.  All patients will be monitored closely for infection and treated aggressively according to institutional guidelines.  WBC growth factor support will be used for all patients. 
If clinically indicated, anti-infective prophylaxis should be implemented at the 
investigator's discretion, including appropriate prophylaxis for viral, fungal, bacterial, or pneumocystis infections.  The Medical Monitor should be notified if these infections are observed.  Potential for drug-drug interactions should be considered (e.g., azoles for fungal prophylaxis).  See Appendix 5 for a list of ex cluded and cautionary medications. 
In addition, t
here has been some indication of mild decrease in cardiac contractility 
following treatment with venetoclax in animal models, though not at this time in humans.  Myocardial toxicity is a recognized dose-related toxicity of anthracyclines such as doxorubicin.  The combination could theoretically, therefore, potentiate cardiotoxicity.  Since no cardiotoxicity was noted in the Phase I part of the study, only a baseline cardiac evaluation with multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram will be performed, unless additional studies are clinically indicated during treatment. 
Potential for drug-drug interactions should be considered (e.g., azoles for fungal 
prophylaxis).  Drug interactions may occur with CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (venetoclax).  The risk of clinically significant PK drug interaction between venetoclax, rituximab, obinutuzumab, and CHOP is expected to be low on the basis of their metabolic pathways.  Rituximab has decreas ed clearance with time that may be related 
to CD20 target expression and tumor burden.  Venetoclax may affect the clearance of rituximab because it has the potential to decrease tumor burden.  Similar considerations may be relevant for obinutuzumab clearance.  Because the agents in this study have not been administered before in combination in patients with NHL, PK samples will be collected to assess whether drug levels differ from the combination compared with historical data to check for potential drug-drug interactions.  See Appendix 5  for a list of 
excluded and cautionary medication s. 
See Section 5 for complete details of the safety evaluation for this study .

4.1.4 Criteria for Tumor Biopsy Tissue  
• Eligible patients must have a repres entative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 
tumor specimen to enable the definitive diagnosis of CD20-positive NHL/DLBCL 
available at the study site. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
93/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 • The specimen must contain adequate evaluable tumor cells to enable Bcl-2 IHC and 
other relevant biomarker analysis. 
Sample can be in a tissue block (preferred) or consist of 20 unstained serial 
slides, accompanied by an associated pathology report.  If fewer than 
20 unstained serial slides (accompanied by an associated pathology report) are 
available, then the study site should consult the Sponsor (or delegate) regarding the acceptability of a fewer number of slides.  Cytological or 
fine-needle aspiration as well as bone marrow samples are not acceptable.  In countries using a different fixative than formalin, available tissue block will be accepted and notation of the type of fixative should be included.  In addition to 
slides in the Phase II portion of the study, a tissue punch for the construction of 
TMAs is required in patients who have an excisional biopsy sample available.  If the archival tissue is unavailable or insufficient based on above criteria, the 
patient may still be eligible if the patient is willing to provide tissue from a 
pretreatment core or excisional/incisional biopsy of the tumor.  Cytological or fine-needle aspiration samples are not acceptable.  The sample should be 
shipped according to instructions provided in the laboratory manual.  If a tissue 
block is provided, after necessary sections are cut and a core punch sample for TMA is taken, the remaining specimen will be returned to site. 
Tissue samples must be sent to the central laboratory within 3 weeks of patient 
randomization. 
  
4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT 
This is an open-label study.  Patients will be assigned to dose levels in the order in 
which they are enrolled.  As described in Section 3.1, enrollment in the dose-finding 
portion of th e study will be limited to
 patients with B-cell NHL with no prior R-CHOP 
therapy and who have received only a single prior treatment regimen. 
In the Phase II portion of the study, previously untreated DLBCL with higher-risk clinical features as determined by an IPI score of 2 −5 will be enrolled.  Allocation to Arm A 
(venetoclax
 + R-CHOP) or Arm B (venetoclax  + G-CHOP) will be by randomization if both 
arms are open to enrollment; allocation will otherwise be via direct assignment to the open arm.  Randomization will be performed by  an IxRS.  Patients will be assigned in a 
1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment arms until Arm B is filled, at which point all patients will be allocated to Arm A. 
After written informed consent has been obtained and preliminary eligibility has been 
established, the study site will submit documentation supporting eligibility to the Sponsor and obtain the Sponsor’s approval to enroll the patient.  After the Sponsor reviews the documentation and approves the patient for enrollment, the Sponsor will provide the dose group assignment and the patient number will be assigned via the IxRS.

94/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 4.3 STUDY TREATMENT 
4.3.1 Venetoclax  
4.3.1.1 Formulation 
The venetoclax tablets will be packaged in high-density polyethylene plastic bottles to 
accommodate the study design.  Each bottle will be labeled per local regulatory requirements.  A desiccant canister may be included in the bottle.  The tablets must be stored at 15 °C−25°C (59 °F−77°F).  If supplied with a desiccant, the desiccant canister 
should be returned to the bottle directly after each tablet removal. 
For further details, see the ABT-199/GDC-0199 Investigator’s Brochure. 
4.3.1.2 Dosage, Admini stration, and Storage 
Study patients will self-administer venetoclax tablets by mouth once daily (QD).  Each 
dose of venetoclax will be taken with approximately 240 mL of water within 30 minutes 
after the completion of breakfast or the patient's first meal of the day.  A meal containing 
approximately 30% of the total caloric content from fat is recommended to ensure 
adequate absorption of venetoclax.  On days that pre-dose PK sampling is required, the 
patient’s first meal of the day (e.g., breakfas t) will be consumed in the morning at the 
clinic, and venetoclax dosing will occur in the clinic  after completion of the to facilitate 
PK sampling.   
The recommended breakfast is as follows:   
1 box cereal (30–40 g) 
Skim milk (240 mL) 1 boiled egg 
1 slice toast (15 g) 
Margarine (10 g)  
 
Total calories should be approximately 520 Kcal; 30% of the total caloric content of the 
meal is from fat. Total grams of fat should be approximately 17 grams. 
See Section 3.1.2.1 for the venetoclax administration sched ule. 
On days wh
en venetoclax plus R-CHOP or G-CHOP are given, the order of study 
treatment administration will be venetoclax prior to rituximab or obinutuzumab, and 
rituximab or obinutuzumab prior to CHOP (with the exception of the first dose of 
prednisone in each cycle; see Section 4.3.4).  On days when both venetoclax and prednisone are given, venetoclax will be taken p r 
ior to prednisone.  If vomiting occurs 
within 15 minutes after taking venetoclax and all expelled tablets are still intact, another dose may be given and the second dose noted in the drug log.  Otherwise, no replacement dose is to be given.  In cases where a dose of venetoclax is missed or forgotten, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible and ensure that the minimal interval between the current dose and the next dose is at least 16 hours in order 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
95/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 to avoid excessive drug accumulation after the next dose.  Patients will be instructed to 
record the date and time they take their daily dose of venetoclax and prednisone.  Diaries will be provided by the Sponsor for this purpose.  Venetoclax must be stored according to labeled storage conditions. 
All patients must receive prophylaxis for TLS (see Section 4.4.1.2) prior to the initiat i
 on 
of venetoclax plus R-CHOP or G-CHOP study treatment. 
4.3.1.3 Dosage Delays and Modification 
The dose of venetoclax should be withheld for clinically significant toxicity potentially 
related to venetoclax treatment (e.g., clinical TLS, febrile neutropenia) until the toxicity has resolved or improved to Grade ≤
 2 or ≥  80% of baseline.  The dose of venetoclax 
may be reduced for Grade ≥ 3 toxicity or recurrent Grade ≥ 2 toxicity after consultation 
with the Medical Monitor (see Table 2 ). 
4.3.2 Rituximab  
4.3.2.1 Formulation 
Rituximab (Rituxan®/MabThera®) is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free liquid 
concentrate for IV administration.  Rituximab is supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in 100-mg (10 mL) and 500-mg (50 mL) single-use vials.  The product is formulated for IV administration in 9.0 mg/mL sodium chlo ride, 7.35 mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, 
and 0.7 mg/mL polysorbate 80, after reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection.  The pH is adjusted to 6.5.  Vials are for single use.  Each vial and carton will contain a label (either single-panel or booklet) affixed to the vial or carton per individual country requirements. 
4.3.2.2 Dosage, Admini stration, and Storage 
Rituximab will be administered intravenously onc e per 21-day cycle in combination with 
CHOP for up to six cycles and as a single agent for two additional cycles.  Patients who experience ongoing response without excessive to xicity may receive up to eight cycles 
of CHOP following discussion between the investigator and the Medical Monitor.  The infusion of 375 mg/m
2 will be based on the patient’s body surface area (BSA) at 
screening and will remain the same throughout the study unless there is a > 10% change 
in body weight.  On a given day, rituximab should be given after venetoclax and prior to CHOP (with the exception of the first dose of prednisone in each cycle; see Section 4.3.4). 
See Section 3.1.2.1 for administration schedule in combination with CHOP. 
Rituximab s hould not be
 administered as an IV push or bolus.  IRRs may occur.  
Premedication consisting of acetaminophen, diphenhydramine (or other suitable antihistamine), and a single dose of hydrocortisone (up to 100 mg or an equivalent dose of methylprednisolone) may also be administered beginning with the first infusion.  Premedication may attenuate IRRs.  Because transient hypotension may occur during 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
96/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 rituximab infusion, consideration should  be given to withholding antihypertensive 
medications for 12 hours prior to rituximab infusion. 
4.3.2.2.1 First Infusion 
The rituximab solution for infusion should be administered intravenously at an initial rate 
of 50 mg/hr.  Rituximab should not be mixed or diluted with other drugs.  If IRRs do not occur, the infusion rate should be escalated in 50 mg/hr increments every 30 minutes to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.  If an IRR develops, the infusion should be temporarily slowed or interrupted.  The infusion can continue at one-half the previous rate upon improvement of patient symptoms. 
4.3.2.2.2 Subsequent Infusions 
If the patient tolerates the first infusion well, subsequent rituximab infusions may be administered at an initial rate of 100 mg/hr and increased in 100-mg/hr increments at 30-minute intervals to a maximum of 400 mg/hr, as tolerated or per an institution’s standard of care IV administration procedure.  If the patient does not tolerate the first infusion well, the guidelines for the first infusion should be followed. 
Rituximab vials must be stored at 2 °C−8°C (36 °F−46°F).  Rituximab vials should be 
stored in the outer carton in order to protect them from light.  Rituximab solution for 
infusion may be stored at 2 °C−8°C (36 °F−46°F) for 24 hours and has been shown to be 
stable for an additional 12 hours at room temperature.  However, because rituximab does not contain a preservative, diluted solutions should be stored refrigerated (2°C−8°C).  No incompatibilities between rituximab and polyvinylchloride (PVC) or 
polyethylene bags have been observed. 
See the local prescribing information for Rituxan/MabThera for additional information. 
4.3.2.3 Dosage Modification 
There will be no rituximab dose modification in this study.  Patients who are at high risk 
for IRR or TLS complications (see Section 4.4.1.4) may, at the investigat or’s discretion, 
receive their initial do
se of rituximab split over 2 consecutive days (e.g., 125 mg/m2 on 
Cycle 1 Day 1, 250 mg/m2 on Cycle 1 Day 2). 
Any NCI CTCAE v4.0 toxicity Grade ≥ 3 in severity that is deemed related to rituximab 
treatment will require interruption of study treatment until resolution to Grade ≤  1.  
Resumption of rituximab treatment may be considered in patients with resolution of toxicities to Grade ≤
 2 within 3 weeks at the discretion of the investigator after 
consultation with the study Medical Monitor.  Failure of such toxicities to resolve after 3 weeks of suspended study treatment will require permanent discontinuation of rituximab. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
97/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Patients who discontinue rituximab because of rituximab-related toxicity may continue to 
receive CHOP and/or venetoclax only after consultation by the investigator with the Medical Monitor. 
4.3.3 Obinutuzumab  
4.3.3.1 Formulation 
Obinutuzumab is provided as a single-dose, sterile liquid formulation in a 50 mL pharmaceutical-grade glass vial containing a nominal 1000 mg of obinutuzumab (G3 material).  The formulated drug product consists of 25 mg/mL drug substance (G3) formulated in histidine, trehalose, and poloxamer 188.  The vial contains 41 mL (with 2.5% overfill). 
For further details, see the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure. 
4.3.3.2 Handling and Storage 
The recommended storage conditions for the obinutuzumab drug product are between 
2°C and 8 °C and protect from light.  Chemical and physical in-use stability for 
obinutuzumab dilutions in 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl) has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2 °C−8°C and at ambient temperature and ambient room lighting.  The 
prepared diluted product should be used immediately.  If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 °C−8°C.  Obinutuzumab should not be frozen 
or shaken.  Mix gently.  All transfer procedures require strict compliance with aseptic techniques.  Do not use an additional in-line filter; this will avoid potential adsorption. 
For further details, see the Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure. 
4.3.3.3 Obinutuzumab Dose and Schedule 
Obinutuzumab will be administered by IV infusion as an absolute (flat) dose of 1000 mg 
in combination with CHOP for up to six cycles and as a single agent for two additional cycles.  Patients who experience ongoing re sponse without excessive toxicity may 
receive up to eight cycles of CHOP following discussion between the investigator and the Medical Monitor.  On a given day, obinutuzumab should be given after venetoclax and prior to CHOP (with the exception of the first dose of prednisone in each cycle; see Section 4.3.4), and patients should b e observed for 30 minutes prior to sta
 rting CHOP.  
Patients at high risk for IRR or TLS complications may, at the investigator’s discretion, receive their obinutuzumab dose split over 2 consecutive days (e.g., 100 mg on Day 1, 900 mg on Day 2).  During Cycle 1, obinutuzumab will also be administered on Days 8 and 15. 
4.3.3.4 Obinutuzumab Preparation 
Obinutuzumab drug product intended for IV infusion is prepared by dilution of the drug product into an infusion bag containing 0.9% NaCl to the final drug concentration of 4 mg/mL.  With the use of a 250 mL infusion bag containing 0.9% NaCl, withdraw and 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
98/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 discard 40 mL of the sodium chloride.  Withdraw 40 mL of obinutuzumab from a single 
glass vial and inject into the infusion bag (discard any unused portion of obinutuzumab left in the vial).  Gently invert the infusion bag to mix the solution; do not shake. 
Administration sets with PVC, polyurethane, or polyethylene as product contact surfaces, 
and IV bags with polyolefin, polypropylene, PVC, or polyethylene as product contact surfaces are compatible and may be used. 
4.3.3.5 Obinutuzumab Administration 
Obinutuzumab should be administered to patients in a clinical setting (inpatient or outpatient), where full emergency resuscitation facilities are immediately available and patients should be under close supervision of the investigator at all times.  Do not administer as an IV push or bolus.  After the end of the first infusion, the IV line or central venous catheter should remain in place for ≥
 2 hours in order to be able to administer IV 
drugs if necessary.  If no adverse events occur after 2 hours, the IV line may be removed or the central venous catheter may be de-accessed.  For subsequent infusions, access (either through an IV line or central venous catheter) should remain in place for at least 1 hour from the end of infusion, and if no adverse events occur after 1 hour, the IV access may be removed. 
See Section 4.4.1.4 and Section 4.4.1.5  for guida
 nce on the us e of premedication and 
prophylaxis of TLS prior to administration of obinutuzumab.  Instructions for the first and 
subsequent infusions of obinutuzumab are presented in Table 1.

99/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Table 1 Administration of First and Subsequent Infusions 
of Obinutuzumab 
First Infusion (Day 1) Subsequent Infusions 
• Begin infusion at and initial rate of 
50 mg/hr.  
• If no infusion reaction occurs, increase the 
infusion rate in 50 mg/hr increments every 
30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.  
• If an infusion reaction develops, stop or 
slow the infusion.  Administer 
infusion-reaction medications and supportive care in accordance with institutional protocol.  Resume the infusion at a 50% reduction in rate (the rate being used at the time that the hypersensitivity or infusion-related reaction occurred) if the 
reaction has resolved.  • If a patient experienced an infusion reaction 
during the prior infusion, start at the same rate 
as the first infusion (50 mg/hr) and follow 
directions as noted. 
• If the patient tolerated the prior infusion well 
(defined as an absence of Grade 2 reactions 
during a final infusion rate of >
 100 mg/hr), 
begin the infusion at a rate of 100 mg/hr.  
• If no infusion reaction occurs, increase the 
infusion rate in 100 mg/hr increments every 
30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.  
• If an infusion reaction develops, stop or slow 
the infusion.  Administ er infusion-reaction 
medications and supportive care in 
accordance with institutional protocol.  Resume the infusion at a 50% reduction in rate (the rate being used at the time that the hypersensitivity or infusion-related reaction 
occurred) if the reaction has resolved.  
 
Obinutuzumab should be given as a slow IV infusion through a dedicated line.  
IV infusion pumps should be used to control the infusion rate of obinutuzumab.  Do not administer as an IV push or bolus. 
On days when both obinutuzumab and CHOP are given, obinutuzumab will be 
administered prior to CHOP (except for first dose of prednisone in each cycle; see Section 4.3.3.6) and patients sh ould be observed for 30 minutes prior to starting
  
CHOP.  CHOP chemotherapy may be administe red the next day if it cannot be given on 
the same day as obinutuzumab administration or if the obinutuzumab dose is split between 2 days.  Prior to each obinutuzumab infusion that is given in combination with CHOP (Day 1 of Cycles 1 −6), patients should take the Day 1 dose of oral prednisone 
(100 mg) specified for each cycle of the CHOP regimen.  The prophylactic use of corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg of IV prednisolone or equivalent) may also be considered for patients thought to be at high risk for IRRs if deemed appropriate by the investigator and should be also administered prior to the obinutuzumab infusion. 
For management of IRRs and anaphylaxis, see Section 4.3.3.8. 
4.3.3.6 Premedication 
Thirty to 60 minutes prior to all obinutuzumab infusions (following venetoclax dosing, if 
applicable), all of the following premedications will be given (unless contraindicated): 
• Oral acetaminophen (650 −1000 mg) 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
100/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 • An antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine (50 −100 mg) 
• Prior to each obinutuzumab infusion that is followed by CHOP chemotherapy, 
patients should take the Day 1 dose of prednisone (100 mg) specified for each cycle 
of the CHOP regimen. 
 
The use of prophylactic corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg IV prednisolone or equivalent) may 
also be considered for patients thought to be at high risk for IRRs and when deemed appropriate by the investigator; they should also be administered prior to the obinutuzumab infusion. 
If the dose of obinutuzumab is split, the Day 2 dose of prednisone (100 mg) specified for 
each cycle of the CHOP regimen should be given prior to the infusion of obinutuzumab. 
4.3.3.7 Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
For patients with evidence of TLS, obinutuzumab should be discontinued and the patients treated as clinically indicated.  Following the complete resolution of TLS complications, obinutuzumab may be re-administered at the full dose during the next infusion in conjunction with prophylactic therapy as indicated (see Section 4.4.1.5). 
4.3.3.8 Management of Infusion-Re lated Reactions and Anaphylaxis 
Medications (including epinephrine for SC in jections, corticosteroids, diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride for IV injection) and resuscitation equipment should be available for immediate use at point of infusion.  Management of infusion-related symptoms for obinutuzumab is summarized in  Table 2.  In the event of a life-threatening IRR (that may 
include pulmonary or c ardiac events) or  an IgE-mediated anaphylactic r
eaction, 
obinutuzumab should be discontinued and no additional drug should be administered.  Patients who experience any of these reacti ons should receive aggressive symptomatic 
treatment and will be discontinued from study treatment. 
Patients who experience obinutuzumab-associated, infusion-related temperature 
elevations of >
 38.5 °C or other minor infusion-related symptoms may be treated 
symptomatically with acetaminophen (≥  500 mg) and/or H 1- and H 2-histamine− receptor 
antagonists (e.g., diphenhydramine hydrochloride, ranitidine).  Serious infusion-related events, manifested by dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress, should be managed with additional supportive therapies (e.g., supplemental oxygen, β
2-agonists, epinephrine, and/or 
corticosteroids) as clinically indicated according to standard clinical practice.

such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride if they have not been received in the previous 
4 hours.  IV saline may be indicated.  For bron chospasm, urticaria, or dyspnea, patients may 
require antihistamines, oxygen, corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg of IV prednisolone or equivalent), and/or bronchodilators.  For hypot ension, patients may require vasopressors. 
 
4.3.3.9 Cardiac or Pulmonary Events 
Patients who have preexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions should be monitored 
carefully throughout the infusion and the post-infusion period. 
4.3.3.10 Dosage Modification or Delay 
There will be no obinutuzumab dose modification in this study.  See Section 4.3.6 and 
Table 3 for dose-delay guidelines. 
4.3.4 CHOP Chemotherapy  
4.3.4.1 Dosage and Administration 
CHOP chemotherapy consists of IV cyclophos phamide, IV doxorubicin, vincristine 
administered by IV push, and oral prednisone or prednisolone.  Standard CHOP will be 
administered for six 21-day cycles.  Patients who experience ongoing response without excessive toxicity may receive up to eight cycles of CHOP following discussion between the investigator and the Medical Monitor. 
• Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m
2 administered intravenously on Day 1 
• Doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 administered intravenously on Day 1 
• Vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 administered by IV push on Day 1 with a cap of 2.0 mg 
• Prednisone 100 mg/day orally (PO) on Days 1 −5 
Note:  The dose of prednisone follows the National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network’s recommendations (2010)  based on  Czuzman and colleagues ( 1999)  
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
102/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 and Hiddemann and colleagues ( 2005) .  Prednisone may be replaced with 
prednisolon
e (1:1 conversion, 100 mg) in countries where prednisone is not 
available or is not the therapy of choice. 
The use of a taper of prednisone (or equivalent) after Day 5 is permitted when 
felt to be appropriate according to the investigator’s standard practice. 
 
CHO(P) will be administered according to the standard preparation and infusion 
procedures at each investigational site and after the rituximab or obinutuzumab infusion.  Refer to the specific package inserts for preparation, administration, and storage guidelines. 
On a given day, CHOP should be given after venetoclax plus rituximab or obinutuzumab, 
with the exception of the first dose of prednisone in each cycle, when prednisone is 
administered prior to the rituximab or obinutuzumab infusion.  On all other days, when 
rituximab or obinutuzumab is not administered, prednisone is given as per institutional CHOP administration standard.  Rituximab or obinutuzumab administration should be completed at least 30 minutes prior to administration of the CHO (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and doxorubicin) infusions. 
Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine may be given on Day 2 of Cycle 1 if the 
rituximab or obinutuzumab dose is split or if the extended time of antibody administration does not permit dosing of first CHOP on the same day.  If CHOP dosing is performed on Day 2 of Cycle 1, the first dose of venetoclax should be administered 3 days after CHOP (see Section  3.1.2.1). 
4.3.4.2 Dosage Modification or Delay 
See Section 4.3.6 and Table 3. 
4.3.5 Administration of Granul ocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor  
All patients must receive G-CSF as primary prophylaxis for neutropenia starting with 
Cycle 1 and continuing through each additional cycle of CHOP  therapy received. 
4.3.6 Dosage Delays and Modifications  
4.3.6.1 Dosage Delays and Modificat ions:  Venetoclax, Rituximab, 
Obinutuzumab, and CHOP Chemotherapy 
Guidelines for dose delay and modification of R/G-CHOP and venetoclax are shown in 
Table 3.  These guidelin es pertain to  dose delays and modifications based on physical 
examination findings, observed toxicities, and laboratory results obtained within 72 hours before study treatment administration.  Dose  delays and dose modifications as a result 
of adverse events not specified in Table 2 should proceed on the basis of 
 the principle of 
maintaining the dose intensity of R/G-CHOP.  The determination of all dose and schedule modifications will be made on the basis of the investigator’s assessment of ongoing clinical benefit with continuing study treatment in consultation with and with the approval of the Medical Monitor.  It is recommended that blood counts be checked within 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
103/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 24−72 hours for patients with cytopenias resulting in dose delays to see if the counts 
have recovered. 
No dose modifications of rituximab or obinutuzumab are allowed.  Cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, and venetoclax doses may be re-escalated (even to the full dose) 
with the approval of the Medical Monitor. 
If administration of chemotherapy is delay ed, the administration of rituximab, 
obinutuzumab, and CHOP should be delayed for the same time frame; for example, 
if CHOP therapy is delayed, administration of rituximab should also be delayed so that they are given together beginning on Day 1 of the same cycle. 
For non-hematologic toxicities, dosing of R-CHOP or G-CHOP may be resumed upon 
resolution to Grade ≤
 1 or baseline status.  Resumption of dosing without complete 
resolution of toxicity may only be considered after careful weighing of the benefits and 
risks with the patient and agreement between the investigator and the Sponsor. 
A dose delay of 14 days is permitted for R-CHOP or G-CHOP to allow recovery of 
hematologic toxicities to Grade ≤  2 or non-hematologic toxicities to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline 
status for the first episode.  Actions for recurrent hematologic adverse events are described in Table 3.  If tr eatment is delayed for more than 2 weeks (except for 
hepatitis B r 
eactivation), the patient should be withdrawn from study treatment, except in 
exceptional circumstances requiring discussion with the Medical Monitor.  (Note that 
lymphopenia is not considered a cytopenic toxicity, because it is an expected outcome of therapy)  Patients who discontinue all study treatment for adverse events should remain 
in the study and continue to have disease assessments through progression and standard follow-up.

Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
109/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 4.3.7 Permanent Treatment  Discontinuation Criteria  
Patients who experience toxicity that can be clearly attributed to any particular study 
drug treatment may discontinue treatment with the specific agent.  If toxicity cannot be clearly attributed to a single agent and is considered possibly related to the combination treatment, treatment with multiple agents should be discontinued.  Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than PD should remain in the study and continue to have disease assessments per protocol. 
4.3.7.1 Permanent Treatment Discont inuation Criteria for Venetoclax 
A patient should discontinue venetoclax permane ntly if any of the following occurs: 
• Grade ≥ 3 toxicity that has a reasonable possibility of being related to the 
administration of venetoclax and that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 2 within 3 weeks 
• Recurrent Grade 4 neutropenia with infection and despite G-CSF support 
• Disease progression 
• Any dose delay of ≥ 4 weeks after last dose 
 
Patients who discontinue venetoclax for reasons other than PD should remain on the 
study and continue to have disease assessments per the protocol.  Patients may continue treatment with R-CHOP or G-CHOP only if it is determined to be in the best interests of the patient, after discussion between the investigators and Medical Monitor. 
4.3.7.2 Permanent Treatment Disconti nuation Criteria for Rituximab or 
Obinutuzumab 
A patient should discontinue rituximab or obinutuzumab permanently if any of the following occur:  
• Grade 4 infusion-related symptom or anaphylaxis:  The patient should be withdrawn 
from study treatment immediatel y and supportive treatment given. 
• Recurrence of Grade 3 infusion-related symptoms at re-challenge, regardless of 
timing (e.g., within same session or at the next session) 
 
4.3.7.3 R-CHOP or G- CHOP Chemotherapy 
Patients should discontinue protocol therapy for any dosing delay exceeding 14 days for 
the initiation of the next planned cycle of R-CHOP or G-CHOP.  Any exceptions will require Sponsor approval. 
4.4 CONCOMITANT AND EXCLUDED THERAPIES 
4.4.1 Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient from 7 days prior to screening through 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax or CHOP, or 90 days after the last dose of rituximab or obinutuzumab, whichever is later.  All 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
110/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the 
Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
Patients who are receiving oral contracept ives, stable doses of hormone replacement 
therapy, or other maintenance therapy should continue their use. 
Steroid use not otherwise dictated by the protocol CHOP treatment will follow the 
guidelines outlined below: 
• Corticosteroid use  > 30 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent:  Not allowed within 
7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1  except as specified below 
• Corticosteroid use 15 −30 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent:  Must be documented 
to be on a stable dose of at least 4 weeks’ duration prior to first dose of study drug. 
• Corticosteroid use  < 15 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent:  Allowed 
 
Exceptions to the above guidelines: 
• Corticosteroid used for malignancy-related symptom control (up to 100 mg/day of 
prednisone or equivalent) prior to initiation of study treatment.  Once study treatment 
has been given, corticosteroid use may be tapered down (must be  ≤ pre-study 
treatment dose) for no more than 5 days. 
• Premedication for rituximab or obinutuzumab infusions, as indicated per protocol 
and/or site local practice (may replace dose of CHOP prednisone) 
• Inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease 
• Topical steroids 
• Replacement corticosteroid therapy for an inherited or acquired deficiency 
• Steroid use to treat emergent issues not related to anti-neoplastic intent is allowed 
for no more than 7 days per event.  For steroid treatment  > 7 days, the Medical 
Monitor must be consulted to discuss allowing the patient to continue treatment. 
 
4.4.1.1 CNS Prophylaxis 
CNS prophylaxis with intrathecal chemotherapy may be given according to institutional 
practice and its use documented on the eCRF.  CNS prophylaxis with systemic chemotherapy may be given only after completion of the primary response assessment (6−8 weeks after Day 1 of Cycle 8).  
4.4.1.2 Prophylaxis for Hemorrhagic Cystitis 
Patients should be adequately hydrated prior to and after cyclophosphamide administration and should be instructed to void frequently.  Mesna may be used as prophylaxis according to institutional practice.  
4.4.1.3 Treatment and Pr ophylaxis of Neutropenia 
G-CSF should be administered as primary prophylaxis starting with Cycle 1 of therapy  
and continue through each cycle of CHOP therapy received  for all patients unless there 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
111/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 is a medical contraindication or the investigator feels it is not in the patient’s best interest 
to receive G-CSF. 
4.4.1.4 Premedication before Ritu ximab or Obinutuzumab Therapy 
Rituximab or obinutuzumab should not be administered as an IV push or bolus because IRRs may occur.  Patients should be premedicated with acetaminophen/paracetamol and an antihistamine prior to all infusions of obinutuzumab.  A single dose of prophylactic corticosteroids (e.g., 100 mg of IV prednisolone or equivalent) may also be administered beginning with the first infusion, comprising the prednisone component of the CHOP treatment.  Premedication may attenuate IRRs.  Because transient hypotension may occur during rituximab or obinutuzumab infusion, consideration should be given to withholding antihypertensive medications for 12 hours prior to infusion. 
4.4.1.5 Prophylaxis for Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
TLS is a risk for patients with NHL who are treated with high cell-killing agents.  The risk 
of TLS is a continuum based on multiple factors that include tumor burden and comorbidities.  Risk is highest for those with bulky disease, elevated absolute 
lymphocyte count, elevated pretreatment LDH levels, compromised renal function, and 
dehydration.  All patients should undergo tumor burden assessment  and CBC with 
WBC differential, and blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine).  Pre-existing chemistry abnormalities should be corrected prior to initiation  of treatment with venetoclax.   
Patients who do not present with bulky disease are not considered at higher risk for TLS and do not require hospitalization, but may be hospitalized per discussion with the investigator and Medical Monitor. 
The risk of TLS in the setting of R-CHOP or G-CHOP should be assessed by the 
investigator and prophylaxis and management undertaken per institutional standard. 
All patients must receive prophylaxis for TLS prior to the initiation of the first dose of 
venetoclax.  Prophylaxis will include the following: 
• Appropriate hydration, consisting of a fluid intake of approximately 2 −3 L/day 
starting 24− 48 hours days prior to the start of venetoclax treatment and continued 
for at least 24 hours after the first dose (for patients for whom volume overload is 
considered a significant risk, hospitalization should be considered) 
• Administration of an agent to reduce uric acid, such as allopurinol 300 mg/day, 
orally beginning 72 hours prior to the first venetoclax dose.  Rasburicase IV should 
be administered (unless medically contraindi cated) for those patients with elevated 
uric acid levels prior to treatment, which is defined as a value above the local 
laboratory ULN or 476 μmol/L.  Agents should be given until normalization of serum 
uric acid and other laboratory evidence of TLS (e.g., elevated serum LDH levels). 
• Laboratory results should be reviewed and electrolyte values should not 
demonstrate any clinically significant abnormalities prior to the first dose of 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
112/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 venetoclax, if abnormalities are observed, the patient should receive additional 
prophylactic treatment and hydration prior to the initiation of dosing. 
• Patients at higher risk of TLS will be hospitalized for the initial venetoclax dose. 
• For patients at particularly high risk for TLS, as judged by the investigator, 
consideration may be given to starting at a lower dose of venetoclax and increasing 
venetoclax dose in a stepwise fashion in di scussion with the Medical Monitor.   
 
On the day of the initial visit with administration of venetoclax (see Section 3.1.2.1), 
serial vital sign assessments will be performed, and serum chemistry an
d hematology 
samples will be drawn prior to the dose of venetoclax and at 8 and 24 hours following 
the dose (see Appendix 1 ).  The serum chemistry and hematology samples will be 
immediately sent to the laboratory, and the investigator or de signee must
 promptly 
review the results.  Laboratory results from pre-dose samples must be reviewed prior to venetoclax administration unless laboratory results from within the prior 24 hours have already been reviewed.  Laboratory values obtained prior to the dose of venetoclax are to be used to determine whether a patient developed a change related to TLS.  Laboratory results from the 24-hour post-dose assessments must be reviewed prior to receiving the dose of venetoclax for that day.  Patients who develop electrolyte changes suggestive of TLS should undergo aggressive management and further monitoring per 
Appendix 6 . 
4.4.1.5.1 Hospitalization 
Patients exhibiting specific characteristics at screening or initiation of venetoclax 
treatment are considered to be at high  risk for development of  TLS and must be 
hospitalized for more intensive prophylaxis and monitored during the initial dose of 
venetoclax.  These patients are identified by the presence of any of the following:    
• Any lymph mass ≥ 10 cm on the screening CT scan 
• Out-of-range (high) absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) or the presence of abnormal 
cells in the peripheral blood differential signifying circulating lymphoma cells 
 
In addition to characteristics requiring mandatory hospitalization, other patient 
characteristics may suggest an increased risk  of TLS.  These include but are not limited 
to the following:   
• Overall disease burden (e.g., several enlarged lymph nodes, even if none reaching 
10 cm) 
• Elevated LDH levels 
• Compromised renal function, as evidenced by low CRCL 
• Extensive bone marrow involvement 
• Dehydration  
 
Hospitalization is not mandatory for patients who exhibit these characteristics, but these 
and any other factors that are considered relevant to TLS should be considered in the 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
113/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 overall assessment of the patient’s state and their risk to develop TLS.  Investigators 
should use their judgment in their assessment of the patient’s risk of TLS development and may choose to hospitalize any patient they consider to be at risk for the development of TLS during the first dose of venetoclax, with approval of the Medical 
Monitor.  
Hospitalization will begin the evening prior to the first dose of venetoclax and continue 
for 24 hours after the first dose.  Upon admission, serum chemistry and hematology laboratory samples should be drawn, and IV hydration should be started with a target of 150− 200 mL/hr or as clinically appropriate.  Laboratory results should be reviewed and 
electrolyte values should not demonstrate clinically significant abnormalities prior to the first dose of venetoclax, or the patient should receive additional prophylactic treatment and hydration prior to the initiation of dosing.  A nephrologist (or acute dialysis service) must be consulted/contacted on hospital admission (per institutional standards) to ensure emergency dialysis is available and the appropriate staff is aware and prepared to handle any necessary intervention for TLS.  Telemetry should also be considered. 
Serial vital sign assessments will be performed, and TLS laboratory samples will be 
drawn (serum chemistry as defined in Section 4.5.1.5) prior to the first do se of 
venetoclax and at 8, 12,
 and 24 hours post-dose; additionally, hematology samples will 
be drawn at 8 and 24 hours post-dose (see Appendix 1 ).  These samples are to be 
immediately sent to the laboratory and the investigator or de signee must
 promptly review 
the results.  Laboratory values obtained prior to the dose of venetoclax are to be used to determine whether a patient developed a change related to TLS.  Laboratory results from the 24-hour post-dose sample must be reviewed prior to receiving the dose of venetoclax for that day.  Patients who develop electrolyte changes suggestive of TLS should undergo aggressive management and further monitoring per Appendix 6 . 
4.4.1.6 Infection Prophylaxis 
If clinically indicated, anti-infective prophylaxis for viral, fungal, bacterial, or pneumocystis infections is permitted.  Although there is a potential for drug-drug interactions, there are likely to be limited potential clinical effects, therefore trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole can be considered for pneumoc ystis prophylaxis, with close clinical 
monitoring.  The Medical Monitor should also be consulted regarding any consideration of the use of azoles as anti-fungal prophylaxis or therapy because of the potential for drug-drug interactions. 
4.4.1.7 Monitoring and Treatment  for Hepatitis B Reactivation 
Patients who are both HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive may be included in this study.  These patients should have HBV-DNA levels obtained monthly during the study and for at least 12 months after the last cycle of therapy by means of real-time PCR with the use of an assay that has a sensitivity of at least 10 IU/mL  
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
114/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 If the HBV-DNA assay becomes positive and is above the WHO cutoff of 100 IU/mL, 
treatment with R-CHOP or G-CHOP chemotherapy will be held and the patient should be treated (for at least 1 year after the last dose of rituximab or obinutuzumab) with an appropriate nucleoside analogue and immediately referred to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist for management.  Patients may resume R-CHOP or G-CHOP chemotherapy once HBV-DNA levels decrease to undetectable levels. 
If the HBV-DNA assay becomes positive and is ≤
 100 IU/mL, the patient should be 
retested within 2 weeks.  If the assay is still positive, treatment with R-CHOP or G-CHOP 
chemotherapy will be held and the patient should be treated with an appropriate nucleoside analogue (for at least 1 year after the last dose of rituximab or obinutuzumab) and immediately referred to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist for management.  Patients may resume R-CHOP or G-CHOP c hemotherapy once the HBV-DNA levels 
decrease to undetectable levels. 
If a patient’s HBV-DNA level exceeds 100 IU/mL while the patient is receiving anti-viral 
medication, treatment with R-CHOP or G-CHOP will be permanently discontinued (see 
Section 4.3.6, Table 3). 
Patients in countries where prophylactic anti-viral medication s for hepatitis B reactivation 
are the stan 
dard of care may be treated prophylactically. 
4.4.1.8 Other Concomitant Medications 
Necessary supportive measures for optimal medical care will be given throughout the 
study according to institutional standards, including the use of growth factors (e.g., erythropoietin) if clinically indicated.  G-CSF will be administered as primary 
prophylaxis in each cycle of  CHOP  therapy (see Section 4.4.1.3). 
Anti-emetic therapy may be instituted
 for any patient if clinically indicated.  It is 
recommended that CHOP infusions be administered following premedication with a 
serotonin (5-HT3) antagonist (i.e., dolasetron, ondansetron, etc.) or per institutional practice. 
Antidiarrheal therapy may be instituted for any patient if clinically indicated per 
institutional practice. 
Live-virus vaccines should not be given within 28 days prior to the initiation of 
study treatment or at any time during study treatment.  Systemic steroid therapy other 
than the prednisone component of CHOP will not be allowed during study treatment with the exceptions noted in Section 4.4.1. 
Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone-replacement therapy, or other 
maintenance therapy should continue their use. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
115/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 4.4.2 Excluded Therapy  
Patients who are discontinued from study treatment will be followed for safety outcomes 
for 30 days following the patient’s last dose of venetoclax or CHOP (or 90 days following the patient’s last dose of rituximab or obinutuzumab, whichever is later) or until the patient receives another anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. 
Use of the following therapies is prohibited during the study:

Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
117/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
Please see Appendix 1  for the schedule of assessments performed during the study. 
4.5.1 Definitions of Study Assessments  
4.5.1.1 Medical Hist ory and Demographics 
Medical history includes all clin ically significant diseases, sm oking history, prior cancer 
history, prior cancer therapies and procedures, and all medications used by the patient 
from 7 days preceding the screening visit to Cycle 1 Day 1. 
4.5.1.2 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include measurements of heart ra te, systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
while the patient is in a seated position, temperature, weight, and BSA (screening only unless
 > 10% change in weight).  Scheduled vital sign assessments should occur prior to 
drug dosing if applicable unless otherwise specified (see Section 4.4.1.5). 
4.5.1.3 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination should include the evaluation of head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat and CV, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded at each subsequent physical examination.  New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events if appropriate. 
As part of tumor assessment, physical exami nations should also include the evaluation 
of the presence and degree of enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. 
Targeted physical examinations (including weight) should be limited to systems of 
primary relevance (i.e., CV, respiratory, those associated with symptoms, and those 
associated with tumor assessment [lymph nodes, liver, and spleen]). 
4.5.1.4 Tumor and Response Evaluation 
All measurable disease must be documented at screening by a combined PET-CT scan 
with a diagnostic quality CT component.  Response assessments will be determined by 
the investigator on the basis of imaging studies and bone marrow examinations (if 
appropriate), with the use of the modified Lugano Classification  (Cheson et al. 2014 ; see 
Appendix 2 ).  A five-p o int scale score is required as part of the PET scan response.  
Responses will also be assessed by the IRC (see Section 3.7). 
Clinical resp onse asse
ssment should incl ude evaluation of the presence and degree of 
enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, and sple nomegaly by physical examination. 
Patients will be evaluated for disease respons e by PET-CT imaging after Cycle 4 and at 
6 to 8 weeks after Day 1 of Cycle 8 or last cycle received .  A bone marrow examination 
must be repeated to confirm a CR if it was previously positive , if it was not performed, 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
118/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 or if it was indeterminate at screening.   For sites at which PET-CT is not available for 
interim assessment (after Cycle 4), diagnostic CT imaging is an acceptable alternative. 
Diagnostic-quality CT scan with use of oral and IV contrast (unless medically 
contraindicated) must be obtained at baseline , after Cycle 4  and at end of treatment 
evaluation (6 to 8 weeks after Day 1 of Cycle 8  or last cycle received ).  If PET-CT with 
diagnostic CT is not obtainable, a separate diagnostic CT scan must be performed at 
these timepoints in addition to the PET scans. 
All patients who have not progressed will then be followed with clinical assessments 
every 3 months until progression or close of study, whichever occurs first.  Assessments will be based on full physical examination.  CT scans (with oral and IV contrast, unless medically contraindicated) will be performed every 6 months for 2 years and as clinically 
indicated during these follow ups .  If a patient exhibits clinical signs of possible disease 
progression (i.e., increased or de novo enlargement of liver, spleen or lymph nodes on 
physical examination), additional assessments including PET-CT or contrast-enhanced 
CT scan and/or bone marrow must be performed to evaluate for PD . 
CT scans (with contrast) should include chest, abdomen, and pelvis scans; CT scans of the neck should be included if clinically indicated  (MRIs may be used instead of CT 
scans in patients for whom CT scans are contraindicated) .  CT scans for response 
assessment may be limited to areas of prior involvement only if required by local 
regulatory authorities.   
Bone marrow examinations should include biopsy and/or aspirate for morphology and 
flow cytometry and are required at screening. 
4.5.1.5 Laborat ory Assessments 
On days of study drug administration, pr e-dose laboratory samples should be drawn 
within 0–4 hours before the start of treatment, unless otherwise specified.  Cycle 1 Day 1 local laboratory assessments can be performed on Day -1 if this schedule is preferable to the site.  Instruction manuals and supply kits will be provided for all central laboratory assessments. 
4.5.1.5.1 Central La boratory Assessments 
Samples for the following assessments will be sent to one or several laboratories or to the Sponsor for analyses. 
• Lymphocyte subset counts.  Whole blood samples will be analyzed by flow 
cytometry for B cells (CD19
+), T-cell subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+), and NK cells 
(CD16+, CD56+)  
• Hepatitis B DNA levels (when appropriate) 
Monitoring of HBV-DNA levels is mandatory for patients who are positive for 
HBcAb and enter the study with negative titers.  For instructions on the 
management of these patients, see Section 4.4.1.7. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
119/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 • PK assays 
Serum samples will be obtained for measurement of rituximab or 
obinutuzumab concentrations and EDTA-anticoagulated; plasma samples will 
be obtained for measurement of venetoclax or CHOP concentrations at 
timepoints noted in Appendix 3 .  The  sampl es will b e sent to the central 
laboratory  and then to a Sponsor designated bioanalytical laboratory or to the 
Sponsor or  designee for analysis.   Relevant biotransformation products of 
study treatment may also be analyzed at the discretion of the Sponsor.  
• Blood and tumor tissue (tumor biopsy) for BCL2 family expression (by IHC), copy 
number alteration and translocation status (by FISH), DLBCL prognostic markers, and other DLBCL disease biology markers including resistance markers. 
• Peripheral blood for MRD assessments 
 
4.5.1.5.2 Local La boratory Assessments 
Samples for hematology, serum chemistry, liver function, and pregnancy will be 
analyzed at the study site’s local laboratory. 
• Hematology:  complete blood count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC count, and WBC 
count), platelet count, ANC, absolute lymphocyte count, and percent or absolute 
differential counts) 
• Serum chemistry:  sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, BUN, 
creatinine, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, 
ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, and uric acid 
• Viral serology and detection 
Hepatitis B (HBsAg and HBcAb) 
HCV antibody (also HCV RNA by PCR if the patient is HCV antibody positive) 
• Serum pregnancy test in females of childbearing potential 
 
4.5.1.6 Electrocardiogram 
A 12-lead ECG is required at screening and as clinically indicated.  ECGs for each 
patient should be obtained with use of the same machine when possible.  ECGs should be obtained in triplicate. 
4.5.1.7 MUGA/Echocardiogram 
MUGA scans will be obtained prior to treatment (see Appendix 1 ).  Echocardiogram may 
be used if MUGA is not available.  Any clin ically significant changes in cardiac function 
must be reported within 
7 days. 
4.5.2 Screening and Pr etreatment Assessments  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed by the Medical Monitor or designee to confirm that patients meet eligibility criteria and are approved for enrollment before the first dose of study drug.  Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before performing any study-specific screening tests or 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
120/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 evaluations.  Informed Consent Forms for patients who are not subsequently enrolled 
will be maintained at the study site. 
Screening and pretreatment tests and eval uations will be performed within 21 days 
preceding the first dose of study drug (except PET-CT scan, which may be performed up 
to 28 days preceding the first dose of study drug, providing no anti-tumor therapy was administered in this period).  Results of standard-of-care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent and within 21 days prior to first dose of study drug may be used (bone marrow examination could have been performed up to 3 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1); such tests do not need to be repeated for screening. 
See the Schedule of Assessments provided in Appendix 1  for the schedule of screening 
and pretreatment assessments. 
4.5.3 Roche Clinical Repository  
4.5.3.1 Overview of the Roche Clinical Repository 
The Roche Clinical Repository (RCR) is a centrally administered group of facilities for 
the long-term storage of human biologic specimens including body fluids, solid tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).  The collection and analysis of RCR specimens will facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug therapy for patients in the future. 
Specimens for the RCR will be collected from patients who give specific consent to 
participate in this optional research.  RCR specimens will be used to achieve the following objectives: 
• To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, adverse events, or disease 
progression 
• To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology 
• To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug absorption 
and disposition 
• To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance 
characteristics of these assays 
 
4.5.3.2 Approval by the Institut ional Review Board or Ethics 
Committee 
Collection and submission of biological samples to the RCR is contingent upon the 
review and approval of the exploratory research and the RCR portion of the Informed Consent Form by each site's Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) and, if applicable, an appropriate regulatory body.  If a site has not been granted approval for RCR sampling, this section of the protocol (Section 4.5.3) will not be 
applicable a t that site.   
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
121/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 4.5.3.3 Sample Collection 
The following samples will be collected for identification of dynamic (non-inherited) 
biomarkers: 
• Tissue and blood samples will be collected and sent to the central laboratories as 
part of the planned study assessments.  Any samples at the central laboratories, 
except PK samples, that remain from the planned study assessments may be taken 
and sent to the RCR if the patient consents to the optional RCR sampling. 
 
The following samples will be collected for identification of genetic (inherited) biomarkers: 
• One whole blood sample for DNA extraction will be drawn at baseline. 
 
For all samples, dates of consent and specimen collection should be recorded on the 
associated RCR page of the eCRF.  For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the Sample Handling and Logistics Manual. 
RCR specimens will be destroyed no later than 15 years after the date of final closure of the associated clinical database.  The RCR storage period will be in accordance with the IRB/EC-approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements). 
The dynamic biomarker specimens for DNA analys is will be subject to the confidentiality 
standards described below. 
4.5.3.4 Confidentiality 
Given the sensitive nature of genetic data, Roche has implemented additional processes 
to ensure patient confidentiality for RCR specimens and associated data.  Upon receipt by the RCR, each specimen is "double-coded" by replacing the patient identification number with a new independent number.  Data generated from the use of these specimens and all clinical data transferred fr om the clinical database and considered 
relevant are also labeled with this same independent number.  A "linking key" between the patient identification number and this new independent number is stored in a secure database system.  Access to the linking key is restricted to authorized individuals and is monitored by audit trail.  Legitimate operational reasons for accessing the linking key are documented in a standard operating procedure.  Access to the linking key for any other reason requires written approval from the Pharma Repository Governance Committee and Roche's Legal Department, as applicable. 
Data generated from RCR specimens must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of national and local health authorities, and Roche monitors, representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate. 
Patient medical information associated with RCR specimens is confidential and may only 
be disclosed to third parties as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or separate 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
122/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, 
unless permitted or required by law. 
Data derived from RCR specimen analysis on individual patients will generally not be 
provided to study investigators unless a request for research use is granted.  The aggregate results of any research conducted using RCR specimens will be available in 
accordance with the effective Roche policy regarding study data publication. 
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know-how originating from 
the use of the RCR data will become and re main the exclusive and unburdened property 
of Roche, except where agreed otherwise. 
4.5.3.5 Consent to Participate in  the Roche Clinical Repository 
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation in the RCR.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RCR.  Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at any time and for any reason during the storage period.  A separate, specific signature will be required to document a patient's agreement to provide optional RCR specimens.  Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature. 
The investigator should document whether the patient has given consent to participate 
by completing the RCR Research Sample Informed Consent eCRF. 
In the event of an RCR participant's death or loss of competence, the participant's 
specimens and data will continue to be used as part of the RCR research. 
4.5.3.6 Withdrawal from th e Roche Clinical Repository 
Patients who give consent to provide RCR specimens have the right to withdraw their 
specimens from the RCR at any time for any reason.  If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to the testing of his or her specimens, the investigator must inform the Medical Monitor in writing of the patient's wishes with the use of the RCR Subject Withdrawal Form and, if the trial is ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the RCR Research Sample Withdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF.  The patient will be provided with instructions on how to withdraw consent after the trial is closed.  A patient's withdrawal from Study GO27878 does not, by itself, constitute withdrawal of specimens from the RCR.  Likewise, a patient's withdrawal from the RCR does not constitute withdrawal from Study GO27878. 
4.5.3.7 Monitoring  and Oversight 
RCR specimens will be tracked in a manner consistent with GCP by a quality-controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information management system, to ensure compliance with data confidentiality as well as compliance with authorized use of specimens as specified in this protocol and in the Informed Consent Form.  Roche 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
123/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 monitors and auditors will have direct access to appropriate parts of records relating to 
patient participation in the RCR for the purposes of verifying the data provided to Roche.  
The site will permit monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, and health authority inspections by providing direct access to source data and documents related to the RCR samples. 
4.5.4 Assessments during Treatment  
All visits must occur within  ± 1 day from the scheduled date, unless otherwise noted.  All 
assessments will be performed on the day of the specified visit unless a time window is specified.  Assessments scheduled on the day of study drug administration of each cycle 
should be performed prior to study drug infusion, unless otherwise noted.   
See the Schedule of Assessments provided in Appendix 1  for the schedule of treatment 
period assessments. 
4.5.5 End of Treatment Visit  
Patients who complete the study treatment period (defined as eight cycles) or who 
discontinue early will have an End of Treatment Visit, 6 to 8 weeks from Day 1 of the last 
cycle received.   
The visit at which response assessment shows PD may be used as the End of 
Treatment Visit. 
See the Schedule of Assessments provided in Appendix 1  for assessment s to be 
performed. 
4.5.6 Follow-Up Assessments  
Ongoing adverse events thought to be related to venetoclax, CHOP, rituximab, or 
obinutuzumab will be followed until the event has resolved to baseline grade, the event is assessed by the investigator as stable, new anti-tumor treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, or when it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse event. 
Patients will be followed for response until disease progression, death, or study closure, 
whichever occurs first.   
4.5.7 Survival Follow-Up Assessments  
Survival follow-up information will be collected via telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or clinic visits approximately every 6 months until death, lost to follow-up, consent withdrawal, or study termination by Roche, whichever occurs first.  All patients will be followed for survival and new anti-lymphoma therapy information unless the patient requests to be withdrawn from follow-up (this request must be documented in the source documents and signed  by the investigator),  is lost to follow-
up, dies, or the study is terminated by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.  If the patient withdraws from the study, the study staff may use a public information source 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
124/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 (e.g., county records) to obtain information about survival status only if permitted per 
local regulations. 
Study closure will occur approximately 2 years after the last patient has completed 
treatment. 
See the Schedule of Assessments provided in Appendix 1  for specified follow-up 
assessm ent
s. 
4.6 PATIENT DISCONTINUATION 
Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time.  
Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Patient withdrawal of consent at any time 
• Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study 
• Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient 
 
See Section 4.3.7 for treatment discontinuation criteria. 
See 
Appendix 1  for assessments tha t are to be p erformed for patients who prematurely 
withdraw from the study. 
4.7 STUDY DISCONTINUATION 
Premature termination of this clinical trial may occur because of a regulatory authority 
decision, change in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.  In addition, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd retains the right to discontinue development of venetoclax in combination with Rituximab or Obinutuzumab and CHOP at any time.  F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to inclusion of the intended number of subjects, but intends only to exercise this right for valid scientific or administrative reasons.  After such a decision, the investigator must contact all participating subjects within 1 week.  As directed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, all trial materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible. 
4.8 POST-STUDY ACCESS  TO VENETOCLAX , OBINUTUZUMAB, 
AND RITUXIMAB  
The Sponsor will offer post-study access to the study drug (venetoclax, obinutuzumab, and rituximab) free of charge to eligible patients in accordance with the Roche Global Policy on Continued Access to Investigatio nal Medicinal Product, as outlined below. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
125/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 A patient will be eligible to receive stud y drug after completing the study if all  of the 
following conditions are met:

4.9 ASSAY METHODS  
Rituximab and obinutuzumab serum concentrations will be measured using a validated 
ELISA method.  Plasma concentrations of venetoclax will be measured using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrom etry method.  The CHO components of 
CHOP may be measured in plasma if needed to confirm exposure for these three chemotherapy drugs.  Plasma concentrations of prednisone will be measured if needed to test for a potential effect of venetoclax on prednisone pharmacokinetics.  Bcl-2 and other exploratory markers will be ev aluated from lymph node tissue with use of 
validated IHC, FISH, quantitative real-time PCR, and sequencing methodologies. 
4.10 STATISTICAL METHODS 
The final analysis will be based on patient data collected through study discontinuation.  Analyses will be based on treated patients (i .e., patients who have received any amount 
of R/G-CHOP or venetoclax).  Analyses will be provided separately for the dose-finding and extension cohorts where appropriate.  Data from patients who receive R-CHOP or G-CHOP only (i.e., have not received any v enetoclax), will be summarized separately. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
126/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 4.10.1 Analysis of th e Conduct of the Study  
Enrollment, major protocol violations, and discontinuations from the study will be 
summarized separately for the dose-finding and extension cohorts where appropriate. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and type 
and duration of malignancy will be summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. 
This study is not designed to detect sex-specific differences.  There is no existing clinical 
data to suggest sex-specific differences regarding efficacy or safety of the investigational drugs.  Therefore, a specific male/female distribution is not defined for the study.  Males and females are equally eligible to participate if they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. 
Study drug administration data will be listed by dose level and line of therapy and any 
dose modifications will be flagged.  The number  of doses, treatment cycles, and average 
dose received for venetoclax plus R-CHOP or G-CHOP for the schedule/cohort will be 
summarized by cohort and dose level with the use of means, SDs, medians, and ranges. 
4.10.2 Safety Analyses  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, summaries of changes from screening assessments in laboratory test results, ECGs, and changes in vital signs. 
All recorded adverse event data will be listed by line of therapy, study site, patient 
number, and schedule/cohort.  All adverse events occurring on or after first study treatment will be summarized by mapped term, appropriate thesaurus levels, and NCI CTCAE v4.0 toxicity grade.  All serious adverse events will be listed separately and summarized. 
Incidence and nature of DLTs experienced within the combination DLT assessment 
window will be listed by dose cohort and study ar m.  Patients who withdraw from study 
treatment prior to completing the DLT assessment window for reasons other than DLT will be considered un-evaluable for DLT and MTD assessments and will be replaced. 
Deaths reported during the study treatment period and those reported during follow-up 
after patient discontinuation will be listed. 
Relevant laboratory and vital sign (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood 
pressure) data will be displayed by time, with NCI CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3 and 4 values identified where appropriate. 
4.10.3 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Mean serum and plasma concentrations, as appropriate, of venetoclax, rituximab, obinutuzumab, and CHOP components versus time will be tabulated and plotted, and 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
127/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 summary statistics will be computed for each scheduled sampling time after appropriate 
grouping.  Concentration-time data for venetoclax and the other analytes will be analyzed using non-compartmental methods, and the PK parameters will be grouped and summarized as appropriate. 
Additional analyses, such as population PK/pharmacodynamic analysis, may be 
performed to characterize the pharmacokinetics and potential correlations of exposure with dose, demographics, pharmacodynamic, safety, and efficacy outcomes.  The results of such additional analyses may be reported separately from the clinical study report.  At the discretion of the Sponsor, all analyses may be extended to include relevant biotransformation products of study treatment. 
4.10.4 Activity Analyses  
4.10.4.1 Tumor Assessment Data 
All patients in the extension cohort who receive any amount of venetoclax or 
R-CHOP/G-CHOP will be included in the activity analysis. 
Response assessment (CR, PR, etc.) as assessed by investigator and central review 
(IRC) by both CT and by combined PET-CT imaging will be summarized.  Summaries will be provided across all patients, by Bcl- 2 and c-Myc status and molecular subtype.  
Cross-tabulations with IPI score will be pr ovided as exploratory analyses, provided that 
enough patients are available within cells.  DOR and PFS will be summarized.  An exploratory analysis of response will be prov ided on the subset of patients who receive 
six cycles of CHOP. 
Response assessment is determined using the modified Lugano Classification:  Revised 
Criteria for Response Assessment ( Cheson et al. 2014 ) specified in Appendix 2 .  Among 
patients with
 an OR, DOR will be defined as the ti
me from the initial CR or PR to the 
time of disease progression or death.  If a patient does not experience death or disease progression before the end of the study, DOR will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment. 
PFS is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to disease progression or 
death while enrolled in the study (defined as death from any cause within 12 weeks of 
last tumor assessment).  If a patient has not experienced PD or death, PFS will be censored at the day of the last tumor assessment. 
4.10.4.2 Interim Analyses 
Interim analyses will be incorporated into the Phase II portion of the study in order to guide potential early stopping of enrollment in the event of lower than expected CR rate.  Data from completed and ongoing studies using R-CHOP and/or G-CHOP will be used as historical controls for comparison.  Currently available data indicates that the historical CR rate based on CT is 65% for Bcl-2 high patients and 72% for Bcl-2 low patients.  Historical PET-defined CR rates for each of the four biological subgroups are 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
128/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 expected to be available from ongoing studies for comparison by the time of first interim 
analysis.  A n extension of the  predictive probability design ( Lee and Liu 2008 ) will be 
used to guide stopping by
 comparing CR rates in the venetoclax  + R-CHOP arm with 
historical controls using R-CHOP.  If at any time, interim analysis suggests that the CR 
rate is lower than expected, the IMC and SOC will review the data and decide whether to recommend stopping enrollment.  Interim analysis decision rules will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan, and will use the most current historical control data available at the time of analysis. 
Additional analyses will be incorporated into the Phase II portion of the study in order to 
evaluate the safety and tolerability of the recommended Phase II dose of venetoclax and to guide early stopping of enrollment, a decrease of dose or dosing schedule for safety reasons on the basis of toxicities observed and ability to maintain chemotherapy dose intensity. 
4.10.4.3 Predictive Diagnostics 
Assay results of additional markers beyond Bcl-2, c-Myc, and molecular subtype may be explored and may be reported by response status. 
4.10.5 Exploratory Analyses  
The effects of demographic and baseline pr ognostic characteristics, including BCL2  
copy number gain and expression of transcripts for BCL2 and family members, other 
apoptotic genes, and genes associated with the ABC or GCB subtypes of DLBCL on efficacy outcomes) will be evaluated using un ivariate and/or multivariate statistical 
methods such as Cox regression and logistic regression. 
4.10.6 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size for the dose-finding stage is based on a modified 3  + 3 design in order 
to guide dose and schedule selection for the Phase II portion on the basis of DLTs.  The expected enrollment for the dose-finding stage is 3 −6 patients per dose level in each of 
the R-CHOP
 + venetoclax and G-CHOP  + venetoclax arms. 
The sample size for the R-CHOP  + venetoclax arm in Phase II is based on obtaining a 
sufficient number for estimation of PET-negative CR rate in patients with D E (Bcl-2 and 
c-Myc co-expressing) DLBCL, overall, for Bcl-2 high patients, and within each of four mutually exclusive biological subgroups:  Bcl-2 high and ABC, Bcl-2 high and GCB, Bcl-2 low and ABC, and Bcl-2 low and GCB.  The expected enrollment for the R-CHOP
 + venetoclax arm in Phase II is approximately 160 −200 patients in order to 
enroll approximately 50 D E-DLBCL patients, approximately 80 −100 Bcl-2 high patients, 
and approximately 40 −50 patients in each of the two Bcl-2 high subgroups.  With 
50 patients, 95% confidence intervals for estimation of CR would have a margin of error not exceeding 16%.  The margin of error would decrease to 9% with 150 patients and to 8% with 200 patients.  Table 5 shows Clopper a nd Pearson 95% CIs for expected 
observed rates for sample sizes 
of 50, 100, 150, and 200.

4.11 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
The Sponsor will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality 
checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC with use of eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of discrepant data, the Sponsor will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC sy stem.  The Sponsor will produce an EDC Study 
Specification document that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data.  Central Laboratory data will be sent directly to the Sponsor through use of the Sponsor’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.  eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data will be consistent with Sponsor’s standard procedures. 
5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
5.1 SAFETY PARAMETERS AND DEFINITIONS 
Safety assessments will consist of monito ring and recording adverse events including 
serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, measurement of 
protocol-specified safety laboratory assessments, measurement of protocol-specified vital signs, and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. 
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor as outlined in 
Section 5.3. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
130/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 5.1.1 Adverse Event  
According to the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a clinical  investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product regardless of causal attribution.  Therefore, an adverse event can be any of the following: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section 5.2.5.10 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition  (
e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline 
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
 
5.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (Immedia tely Reportable to the Sponsor)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) 
• Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death) 
• This does not include any adverse event that might have caused death had it 
occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue.   
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.2.5.11) 
• Results in p ersistent or 
significant disability and/or incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug 
• Significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above) 
 
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not  synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity 
of an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to 
NCI CTCAE v4.0 criteria; see Section 5.2.3); the event itself may be of relatively 
minor medical signif i
cance (such as severe headache without any further findings).  
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
131/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient or event outcome or action 
criteria usually associated with events that  pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital 
functions.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor 
immediately via the Adverse Event eCRF (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section 5.3.2 for reporting instructions). 
5.1.3 Adverse Events of Special In terest (Immediately Reportable to 
the Sponsor)  
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately via the Adverse Event eCRF (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event; see Section 5.3.2 for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of 
special inter 
est for this study include the following: 
• Cases of potential drug-induced liver inju ry that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy’s 
law (see Section 5.2.5.7) 
• Suspected t r
ansmission of an infectious agent by the study drug, as defined below 
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term only
 applies when a 
contamination of the study drug is suspected. 
• Grade 4 febrile neutropenia 
• Grade ≥ 3 IRRs to rituximab or obinutuzumab 
• Grade ≥ 4 TLS 
 
Hepatitis B reactivation will be followed as an adverse event of particular interest. 
5.2 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.1.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and re
ported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.3, Section 5.4, and 
Section 5.5. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
132/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.1.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.2.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.2.4
).   
5.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact.  All adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
After informed consent  has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol-mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see Section 5.3.2 for instructions for reporting se rious adverse events). 
After initiation of stud 
y medications (venetoclax, rituximab, obinutuzumab, or CHOP), 
all adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be reported through 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax or CHOP, or 90 days after the last dose of rituximab or obinutuzumab, whichever is later.  After this period, the investigator should 
report any deaths, serious adverse events or adverse ev ents of special interest that are 
believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see Section 5.5). 
5.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient eval uation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive 
questions include: 
“How have you felt since your last clinic visit?” 
“Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?” 
 
5.2.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE v4.0 will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 6 will be used for a ssessing se verity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening:  
hospitalization or prolongation of hospi talization indicated, disabling or 
limiting self-care activities of daily living b, c

Note:  Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE (v4.0), which can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevel opment/electronic_appl ications/ctc.htm 
a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
b Examples of self-care activities of daily living include bathing, dr essing and undressing, 
feeding one's self, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who are not bedridden. 
c If an event is assessed as a "significant medi cal event," it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section 5.3.2  for reporting in structions), per the definition of serious 
adverse event in Section 5.1.2 . 
d Grade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.3.2  for 
reporting in
structions), per the definiti on of serious adverse event in Section 5.1.2 . 
 
5.2.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see Table 7): 
• 
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable) 
• Known association of the event with t he study drug or with similar treatments 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study 
• Presence of risk factors in the patient or  use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event 
• Presence of non −treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event 
 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
134/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Table 7 Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts, 
evidence, science-based rationales, and clinical judgment?  
YES There is a plausible temporal relati onship between the ons et of the adverse 
event and administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot 
be readily explained by the patient’s clin ical state, interc urrent illness, or 
concomitant therapies, and/or the adver se event follows a known pattern of 
response to the study drug, and/or the adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction, and if applicable, 
reappears upon rechallenge. 
NO Adverse events will be considered related, unless they fulfill the criteria as 
specified below:  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study 
drug (e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant medication ) and/or the adverse event has no 
plausible temporal relationship to administration of the study drug 
(e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after first dose of study drug). 
 
For patients who receive combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol-mandated therapy. 
5.2.5 Procedures for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF; use of colloquialisms and abbreviations should be avoided. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event description field on the 
Adverse Event eCRF. 
5.2.5.1 Infusion-Related Reactions 
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and that are judged to be related to study drug infusion should be captured as a diagnosis (e.g., "infusion-related reaction [IRR]") on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If possible, avoid ambiguous terms such as "systemic reaction."  Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated IRR eCRF.  If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated IRR eCRF. 
5.2.5.2 Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
For adverse events other than IRRs (see Section 5.2.5.1), a diagnosis (if known) should 
be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individ
ual signs and symptoms 
(e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
135/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and 
symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event report based on of the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
5.2.5.3 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events.  A m edically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
5.2.5.4 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded at the time the event is first reported, and the severity should be updated to reflect the most extreme severity any time the event worsens.  If t he event becomes serious, the Adverse Event 
eCRF should be updated to reflect this, and the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.3.2 for reporting instructions).  The  Adverse Event eCRF should be 
updated by changing th
e event from "non-serious" to "serious," providing the date that 
the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events. 
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
136/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 5.2.5.5 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by clinical symptoms 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
Note:  For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse 
events. 
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in  deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≥ 5 × ULN associated with cholestasis), only the 
diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., “elevated potassium,” as opposed to “abnormal potassium”).  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should 
be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF unless the etiology 
changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens (see Section  5.2.5.4 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events). 
5.2.5.6 Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Accompanied by clinical symptoms 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
137/Protocol GO27878, Version 8  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF unless the etiology 
changes.  The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens (see Section 5.2.5.4 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events). 
5.2.5.7 Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (“Hy’s law”).  Therefore, investigators must report the occurrence of either of the following as an adverse event: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >
 3 × ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST > 3 × ULN in combination with clinical jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.2.5.2) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning o f 
the event), either as a se
rious adverse event  or an adverse event of special interest 
(see Section 5.3.2). 
5.2.5.8 Deaths 
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.2.1) that are attributed 
by the investigator sole ly to progression of lymphoma should be record 
ed only on the 
Study Completion/Early Discontinuation eCRF.  All other deaths on the study, regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.3.2).   
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distin ct event.  The event or condit 
ion 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  The term "sudden death" should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
138/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 without preexisting heart disease, within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the 
case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, "unexplained death"  should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should be replaced by the established cause of death. 
During survival follow-up, deaths attributed to progression of lymphoma should be 
recorded only on the Study Completion/Early Discontinuation eCRF.  
5.2.5.9 Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only
 if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., "more frequent headaches"). 
5.2.5.10 Lack of Efficacy or  Worsening of Lymphoma 
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease should not
 be recorded as adverse events.  These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.  In most cases, the expected pattern of progression will be based on the modified Lugano Classification:  Revised Criteria for Response Assessment (see Appendix 2 ).  In rare cases, the determination of clinical 
progression 
will be on the basis of symptomatic deterioration.  However, every effort 
should be made to document progression with the use of objective criteria.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is the result of disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event. 
5.2.5.11 Hospitalization or  Prolonged Hospitalization 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalizat ion (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospital) 
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.1.2), except as outlined 
below. 
The followin g hospitaliza
tion scenarios are not  considered to be adverse events: 
• Planned hospitalization r equired by the protocol (e.g., to provide TLS prophylaxis 
or monitoring without significant clinical sequelae, or to perform an efficacy 
measurement for the study) 
• Hospitalization for respite care 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
139/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 • Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met: 
The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the 
study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected 
normal progression of the disease 
The patient has not experienced an adverse event 
• Hospitalization due solely to progression of the underlying cancer 
 
The following hospitalization scenarios are not considered to be serious adverse events, 
but should be reported as adverse events instead: 
• Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient 
care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours. 
 
5.2.5.12 Adverse Events As sociated with an Overdose or Error in Drug 
Administration 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event but may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills serious criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.3.2). 
5.3 IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGATOR TO SPONSOR 
Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report 
such events to the Sponsor immediately  via the Adverse Event eCRF; under no 
circumstances should reporting take place more than 24 hours after the investigator 
learns of the event.  The following is a list of events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: 
• Serious adverse events 
• Adverse events of special interest • Pregnancies 
 
The investigator must report new significant follow-up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately via the Adverse Event eCRF (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
becoming aware of the information).  New significant information includes the following: 
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis 
• Significant new diagnostic test results 
• Change in causality based on new information 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
140/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 • Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery 
• Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event 
 
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.

Toll-free numbers for the Help Desk and Medical Monitor contact information will be distributed to all investigators (see "Protocol Administrative and Contact Information & List of Investigators").  
5.3.2 Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and  
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
5.3.2.1 Events Occurring prior to Initiation of Study Drug 
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a protocol-mandated intervention should be reported.  A paper Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form and fax cover sheet should be completed and faxed to Roche Safety Risk Management or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), with use of the fax numbers provided to investigators (see "Protocol Administrative and Contact Information & List of Investigators").  The Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form can also be scanned and e-mailed. 
5.3.2.2 Events Occurring afte r Initiation of Study Drug 
After initiation of study drug, serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be reported through 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax or CHOP or 

 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
141/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 90 days after the last dose of rituximab or obinutuzumab, whichever is later.  
Investigators should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the EDC system.  A report will be generated and sent to Roche Safety Risk Management or its designee by the EDC system. 
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, a paper Serious Adverse 
Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form and fax cover sheet should be 
completed and faxed or scanned and emailed to Roche Safety Risk Management or its 
designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), with use 
of the fax numbers provided to investigators (see "Protocol Administrative and Contact Information & List of Investigators").  After the EDC system is available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system.   
Instructions for reporting post-study adv erse events are provided in Section 5.5. 
5.3.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies  
5.3.3.1 Pregnancies in Female Patients 
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the 
investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 12 months after the last dose of venetoclax or rituximab or within 18 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab, whichever is later.  A Pregnancy eCRF should be completed by the investigator immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy) and submitted via the EDC system.  A pregnancy report will automatically be generated and sent to Roche Safety Risk Management.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue through conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  In addition, the investigator will update the Pregnancy eCRF when updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available. 
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, a paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy 
Reporting Form and fax cover sheet should be completed and faxed  or scanned and 
emailed  to Roche Safety Risk Management or its designee immediately (i.e., no more 
than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy) with use of the fax numbers provided to 
investigators (see "Protocol Administrative and Contact Information & List of Investigators").  Once the EDC system is available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
142/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 5.3.3.2 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients 
Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 12 months after the last dose of venetoclax or rituximab or within 18 months after the last dose of obinutuzumab, whichever is later.  A Pregnancy eCRF should be completed by the investigator immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy) and submitted via the EDC system.  Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study drug.  The pregnant partner will need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for follow-up on her pregnancy.  Once the authorization has been signed, the investigator will update the Pregnancy eCRF with additional information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy.  An investigator who is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus, to support an informed decision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or obstetrician. 
In the event that the EDC system is unavail able, follow reporting instructions provided in 
Section 5.3.3.1. 
5.3.3.3 Abortions 
Any abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor considers 
abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.3.2).   
5.3.3.4 Congenital Anom alies/Birth Defects 
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study drug or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.3.2). 
5.4 FOLLOW-UP OF PATIEN TS AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS 
5.4.1 Investigator Follow-Up  
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow-up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial-related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. 
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
143/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 verification.  If, after follow-up, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be 
established, an explanation should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.  
If the EDC system is not available at the time of pregnancy outcome, follow reporting instructions provided in Section 5.3.3.1. 
5.4.2 Sponsor Follow-Up  
For serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the 
Sponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. 
5.5 POST-STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS 
At the time of study treatment  completion or study treatment  discontinuation, the 
investigator should instruct each patient to report to the investigator any subsequent adverse events that the patient’s personal physician believes could be related to prior study drug treatment or study procedures.   
The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious 
adverse event
 or adverse event of special interest that occurs after the end of the 
adverse event reporting period (defined as 30 days after the last dose of venetoclax or CHOP or 90 days after the last dose of rituximab or obinutuzumab, whichever is later [see Section 5.2.1]) if the event is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment.  
The Sponsor should also be notified  if the investigator becomes aware of the 
developmen 
t of cancer or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a subsequently conceived 
offspring of a female patient exposed to study drug or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug. 
The investigator should report these events directly to Roche Safety Risk Management 
via telephone or via fax machine or scanned and emailed with the use the Serious 
Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form and fax cover sheet 
(see "Protocol Administrative and Contact Information & List of Investigators"). 
5.6 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES, 
INVESTIGATORS, INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS, AND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES 
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and adverse events of 
special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable health authorities on the basis of applicable legislation. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
144/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events with the use of the following reference documents: 
• ABT-199/GDC-0199 Investigator's Brochure 
• Obinutuzumab Investigator’s Brochure • Local prescribing information for rituximab  
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed.

6.3 INFORMED CONSENT FORM 
The Sponsor’s Sample Informed Consent Form will be provided to each site.  The 
Sponsor or its designee must review and approve any proposed deviations from the Sample Informed Consent Form or any alternate consent forms proposed by the site (collectively, the “Consent Forms”) before IRB/EC submission.  Patients must be re-consented to the most current version of the Consent Forms during their participation in the study.  The final IRB/EC-approved Consent Forms must be provided to Sponsor for regulatory purposes. 
The Consent Forms must be signed by the patient or the patient’s legally authorized 
representative before his or her participation in the study.  The case history for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
146/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 was obtained prior to participation in the study.  A copy of each signed Consent Form 
must be provided to the patient or the pati ent’s legally authorized representative.  If 
applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local language. 
All signed and dated Consent Forms must remain in each patient’s study file and must 
be available for verification by study monitors at any time. 
The Informed Consent Form should be revised whenever there are changes to 
procedures outlined in the informed consent or  when new information becomes available 
that may affect the willingness of the patient to participate. 
For any updated or revised Consent Forms, the case history for each patient shall 
document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained for the updated/revised Consent Form for continued participation in the study.  The final revised IRB/EC-approved Informed Consent Form must be provided to the Sponsor for regulatory purposes. 
If the site utilizes a separate Authorization Form for patient authorization to use and 
disclose personal health information under the HIPAA regulations, the review, approval, and other processes outlined above apply except that IRB/IEC review and approval may not be required per study site policies. 
6.3.1 Optional Research Informed Consent  
If archival tissue and/or plasma/serum collection for optional research described in Section 4.5.3 is approved by the IRB/IEC, the Consent Form entitled “Sa m
 ple Research 
Informed Consent Form” will be provided by the Sponsor to each study site.  This form gives patients the option to authorize the collection and use of these samples and personal health information for additional research purposes.  Signing of this separate consent form is not required for enrollment in the trial but is required prior to any optional research sample collection.  All proc edures outlined above for review, approval, 
processing, and use of Consent Forms also apply to this optional research form. 
In the United States, each Informed Consent Form may also include authorization 
allowing the institution, investigator, subinvestigator, and the Sponsor(s) to use and disclose Personal Health information in compliance with the HIPAA of 1996. 
Signed and dated Informed Consent Forms must remain in each patient’s study file and 
must be available for verification by study monitors at any time. 
6.4 COMMUNICATION WITH THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD 
OR ETHICS COMMITTEE 
This protocol, the Informed Consent Forms, any information to be given to the patient, and relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB/EC by the Principal 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
147/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Investigator for review and approval before the study is initiated.  In addition, any patient 
recruitment materials must be approved by the IRB/EC. 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for providing written summaries of the status of 
the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the regulatory requirements and policies and procedures established by the IRB/EC.  Investigators are also responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protocol changes or amendments and of any unanticipated problem s involving risk to human patients 
or others. 
In addition to the requirements to report prot ocol-defined adverse events to the Sponsor, 
investigators are required to promptly
 report to their respective IRB/EC all unanticipated 
problems involving risk to human patients.  Some IRBs/ECs may want prompt 
notification of all serious adverse events, whereas others require notification only of events that are serious, assessed to be related to study treatment, and are unexpected.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports or other safety-related communications from the Sponsor.  Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with regulatory requirements and with the policies and procedures established by their IRB/EC and archived in the site’s Study File. 
6.5 STUDY MONITORI NG REQUIREMENTS 
Site visits will be conducted by an authorized Sponsor representative to inspect study data, patients’ medical records, and eCRFs.  The Principal Investigator will permit Sponsor monitors/representatives and collaborators, the FDA, other regulatory agencies, IRBs, and the respective national or local health authorities to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study. 
6.6 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS 
eCRFs are to be completed using a Sponsor-designated EDC system.  Sites will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion.  eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordance with instructions from the Sponsor. 
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff.  eCRFs should be 
reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee. 
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records. 
6.7 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
148/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  They include but are not limited to hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at the pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial.  
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must never be obliterated or destroyed. 
To facilitate source data verification, the investigators and institutions must provide the 
Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities. 
6.8 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly  into a study site’s computerized medical 
record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computeriz ed systems used in clinical research.  An 
acceptable computerized data collection system (for clinical research purposes) would be one that:  1) allows data entry only by authorized individuals, 2) prevents the deletion or alteration of previously entered data and provides an audit trail for such data changes (e.g., modification of file), 3) protects the database from tampering, and 4) ensures data preservation. 
In collaboration with the study monitor, the Sponsor’s Quality Assurance group may 
assist in assessing whether electronic records generated from computerized medical record systems used at investigational sites can serve as source documents for the purposes of this protocol. 
If a site’s computerized medical record system is not adequately validated for the 
purposes of clinical research (as opposed to general clinical practice), applicable hardcopy source documents must be maintained to ensure that critical protocol data entered into the eCRFs can be verified. 
6.9 STUDY MEDICATION ACCOUNTABILITY 
All study drugs required for completion of this study will be provided by the Sponsor.  The recipient will acknowledge receipt of the drug by returning the appropriate documentation form indicating shipment content and condition.  Damaged supplies will be replaced. 
 
Venetoclax (GDC-0199)—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 
149/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Accurate records of all study drugs received at, dispensed from, returned to, and 
disposed of by the study site should be recorded with the use of the Drug Inventory Log. 
Study drugs will either be disposed of at the study site according to the study site’s 
institutional standard operating procedure or returned to the Sponsor with the appropriate documentation, as determined by the study site.  If the study site chooses to destroy the study drug, the method of destruction must be documented. 
The Sponsor must evaluate and approve the study site’s drug destruction standard 
operating procedure prior to the initiation of drug destruction by the study site. 
6.10 DISCLOSURE OF DATA 
Patient medical information obtained by this  study is confidential and may be disclosed 
to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or separate authorization to use and disclose personal health information) signed by the patient or unless permitted or required by law. 
Medical information may be given to a patient’s personal physician or other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare for treatment purposes. 
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of the FDA and other regulatory agencies, national and local health authorities, the Sponsor monitors/representatives and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for each study site, if appropriate. 
6.11 RETENTION OF RECORDS 
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of investigational medicinal product, including eCRFs, electronic Patient Reported Outcome data (if applicable), Informed Consent Forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study, or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, whichever is longer.  After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations. 
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor.  Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to another party or moving them to another location.

159/Protocol GO27878, Version 8 Appendix 2  
The Modified Lugano Classification:  Revised Criteria for 
Response Assessment 
Responses should be determined on the basis of radiographic and clinical evidence of 
disease.  Assessment of positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) should follow the Recommendations for Initial Evaluation, Staging, and Response Assessment for Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin’s  Lymphoma:  The Lugano Classification 
described by Cheson (2014), is presented in the Revised Criteria for Response 
Assessment table with the following modifications:  (1) For complete response (CR), if 
the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma or indeterminate prior to treatment, the 
infiltrate must have cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy; (2) For PET-CT-based partial 
response (PR), CT criteria for PR (or CR) must also be met. 
Selection of measured dominant (indicator) lesions:   
• Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions 
selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters 
A measurable node must have a longest transverse diameter of a 
lesion (LDi) >
 1.5 cm. 
A measurable extranodal lesion should have an LDi > 1.0 cm. 
• Nodes should preferably be from disparate regions of the body and should include, 
where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. 
• Non-nodal lesions include those in solid organs (e.g., liver, spleen, kidneys, and 
lungs), gastrointestinal (GI) involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpation. 
• If possible, they should be from disparate regions of the body 
• Should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these 
sites are involved 
 
Selection of non-measured (non-indicator) lesions: 
• Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly assessable 
disease should be considered not measured. 
These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not 
selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for 
measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected disease that would be difficult to follow 
quantitatively with measurement, including pleural effusions, ascites, bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be confirmed and followed by imaging. 
 
In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites (e.g., GI tract, liver, and bone marrow), 
18F-fleurodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with 
complete metabolic response, but should be no higher than surrounding normal

It is recognized that in Waldeyer’s ring or extranodal sites 
with high physiologic uptake or with activation within spleen or marrow (e.g., with chemotherapy or myeloid colony-stimulating factors), uptake may be greater than normal mediastinum and/or liver.  In this circumstance, complete metabolic re sponse may be inferred if uptake at 
sites of initial involvement is no greater than surrounding normal tissue even if the tissue has high physiologic 
uptake. Target nodes/nodal masses must regress to ≤ 1.5 cm in LDi.

Recommendations for Initial Management of Electrolyte 
Imbalances and Prevention of Tu mor Lysis Syndrome in the 
Setting of Treatment with Venetoclax 
First dose of venetoclax or dose increase: 
• Within the first 24 hours after either the first dose or dose increase, if any laboratory 
criteria below are met, the patient should be hospitalized for monitoring and the 
investigator notified.  No additional venetoclax doses should be administered until resolution.  A rapidly rising serum potassium level is a medical emergency. 
• Nephrology (or acute dialysis service) must be consulted and/or contacted on 
admission (per institutional standards to ensure emergency dialysis is available). 
• Intravenous (IV) fluids (e.g., D5 1/2 normal saline) should be initiated at a rate of at 
least 1 mL/kg/h rounded to the nearest 10 mL (target 150 to 200 mL/h; not 
<
 50 mL/h).  Modification of fluid rate should also be considered for individuals with 
specific medical needs. 
• Monitor for symptoms or signs of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS; e.g., fever, chills, 
tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, hypotension, muscle aches, 
weakness, paresthesias, mental status changes, confusion, and seizures).  If any 
clinical features are observed, recheck potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, calcium, 
and creatinine within 1 hour. 
• Vital signs should be taken at time of  all blood draws or any intervention. 
• The management recommendations below focus on the minimum initial responses 
required.  If a diagnosis of TLS is established, ongoing intensive monitoring and multi-disciplinary management will be as per institutional protocols.

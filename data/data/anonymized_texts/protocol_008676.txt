1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
Summary  
 
Metastatic  prostate  cancer  is predominantly  bone -tropic,  and bone  metastases  result  in blood  
dyscrasias,  cord compression,  fracture,  pain,  neurologic  compromise,  and death.  New therapies  
are desperately needed,  and many  novel  targeted  therapies,  androgen  receptor (AR) -targeted  
treatmen ts, chemotherapies,  vaccines,  immunologic  drugs  and immunotoxins  are currently  being  
tested.  Unfortunately,  drug development  and clinical  care for these  patients  is significantly  
hampered  by the lack of any standard  means  of accurately  assessing  the primary  reservoir  of 
distant  disease,  which  is embedded  in the marrow  of the axial skeleton.  
 
Bone  scintigraphy  demonstrates reactive  bone  deposition  only and not the cancer itself.  Bone  
lesions  shown  on computerized  tomography  (CT) and plain radiographs  generally  only appear  as 
sclerotic  lesions  that bear no relation  to active  tumor size, nor can  these  methods distinguish  
between  the healing  effects  of successful  therapy  vs. the osteoblastic  response  of bone  to a 
tumor that  is continuing  to progress  on therapy.  
 
The lack of good  imaging  methods  hampers  decision  making  in terms  of when  to apply  or modify  
conventional  treatment  methods  as well as limiting  new drug development.   Accurate  imaging  
modalities  are particularly  needed  in the age of targeted  or biologic  therapies,  where  effective  
therapies  may be cytostatic  and may not result  in significant  prostate -specific  antigen  (PSA)  
declines.  In such  cases,  molecular  imaging  may be the only means  by which  early  biologic  activity 
of a new drug may be detectable  in a Phase  I or Phase  II study.  Furthermore  when  targeted  
therapies  are to be used  it is desirable  to have  an imaging  test that identifies  that the target  is 
present  in order to select  patients  and that may be also be used  to determine  if the target  is being  
“hit” or downregulated.  Many examples  of this target  selection  and monitoring  approach  exist.  
Examples  include  bone  scan  for selection  of radionuclide  therapy  with Sm-153 EDTMP  or Sr-89 
chloride,  I-123 MIBG  to select  patients  for I-131 MIBG  therapy  or In-111/Ga -68 Somatostatin  
receptor  scintigraphy  to select  patients  for Y-90/Lu -177 Somatostatin  receptor therapy.  
 
The Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer Center (MSKCC)  Genitourinary  (GU) Oncology  Service   
has long collaborated  with the Nuclear  Medicine  Service  and the Department  of Radiology  to 
develop  novel  imaging  modalities for prostate  cancer.  Using  the MSKCC  clinical  states  model  
(Scher and  Heller  2000 ) as a template  for radiologic  investigations  as well as clinical  
investigations,  we have  established  a methodology  for exploring  positron  emission  tomography  
(PET)  in prostate  cancer  that controls  for clinical  state,  disease  progression,  scanning  algorithm,  
method  of interpretation,  data collection,  and data analysis.  Using  these  techniques,  we have  
demonstrated  that fluorine -18-fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG)  PET can be used  to detect  disease  and 
demonstrate  treatment  effects  and that fluorinated  dihydrotestosterone  (FDHT)  PET can be used  
to detect  disease  and demonstrate  pharmacodynamic  effects  of AR-targeted  agents ( Morris,  
Akhurst  et al. 2002 ; Larson,  Morris  et al. 2004 ; Zanzonico,  Finn et al. 2004 ; Morris,  Akhurst  et al. 
2005 ). Furthermore  we have  collaborated  on imaging  and therapy  based  antibody  approaches  
targeting  Prostate  Specific  Membrane  Antigen  (PSMA).  These  approaches  have  shown  the 
feasibility  of using  an antibody to target  prostate  cancer  (Bander,  Trabulsi  et al. 2003 ; Nanus,  
Milowsky  et al. 2003 ; Milowsky,  Nanus  et al. 2004 ; Bander,  Milowsky  et al. 2005 ; Morris,  Divgi  et 
al. 2005 ; Morris,  Pandit -Taskar  et al. 2007 ; Pandit -Taskar,  Morris  et al. 2008 ). Currently  in 
collaboration with the chemistry  core we have  been  developing  Zirconium -89 (89Zr) , a positron - 
emitting  radionuclide,  labeled  to J591  has been  approved  by the IRB (protocol  #11-126) and 8 
patients  have  been  accrued  thus far (up to 4-28-2012)  without  dose  limiting  toxicity.  J591  is an 
antibody  that recognizes  the external  domain  of prostate -specific  membrane  antigen.  Furthermore

 we have  prepared  clinical  grade  89Zr trastuzumab  and a protocol  is being  written.  Thus  we have  in 
place the technology  to develop  89Zr labeling  of antibodies  of interest.  
 
Six-transmembrane  epithelial  antigen  of the prostate -1 (STEAP1)   is a multi -transmembrane,  
cell-surface  antigen  of unknown  function  that is overexpressed  in 8 5% of human  epithelial  
prostate  cancers.  Genentech  has developed  an antibody,  MSTP2109A  that binds  to STEAP1.  
They  have  developed  an antibody  drug conjugate  (ADC)  DSTP3086S   that contains  the 
humanized  lgG1  anti-STEAP1  monoclonal  antibody  MSTP2109A  and a potent  anti-mitotic  
agent,  monomethyl  auristatin  E (MMAE),  linked  through  a protease -labile   linker,  
maleimidocaproyl -valine -citrulline -p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl  (MC-VC-PAB).  This reagent  is 
currently  in a phase  I therapeutic  multicenter  trial in which  MSKCC  is participating  (PI Daniel  
Danila  protocol,  MSKCC  11-016).  Therefore  it is desirable  to develop  an imaging  reagent that  
identifies  the presence  and intensity  of the target  by in vivo imaging.  In addition,  if the tracer  
appears  to identify  prostate  cancer metastases  effectively,  then it may further  be developed  as an 
imaging  biomarker for prostate  cancer  even  independent  of the specific  STEAP1 -targeted  
therapy.  
 
 
Schema  
 
Cohort  1A and 1B will each  have  the same  clinical  characteristics  and inclusion  criteria  
requirements.   Both sets of patients  will undergo  serial  pharmacokinetics  and serial  imaging  
exams  post 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  injection.  
 
Upon  the completion  of pharmacokinetics  and serial  imaging  (post  Cohort  1A), patients  will 
proceed  accordingly  based  upon tumor  detection  observed,  and whether  there  is suggestio n of 
antigen  sink or rapid  clearance  that affects  tumor imaging.  The difference  between  the 2  cohorts  
will be that 1A will receive  10 mg total of DFO -MSTP2109A  and if cohort  1B is necessary,  
because  criteria  described  above  of suboptimal  imaging  or pharmacokinetics,  patients  will receive  
20 mg total of DFO -MSTP2109A.    From   cohort  1A (10mg)   or 1B (20 mg), we will decide  what 
antibody  amount  (10 or 20 mg) is best and the optimal  time of image  acquisition.   Cohort 2 will 
then consist  of patients  with the same  characteristics  and inclusion  criteria  as in cohort  1A and 1B,  
with the only difference  being  that they will receive  the best dose  determined  from cohort  1A or   
1B (10 or 20mg).  Furthermore,  they will not undergo  pharmacokinetics  and rather than serial  
imaging,  the patients will only have  one scan  at an optimal  time post injection  of antibody  
determined  from serial  imaging  of Cohort  1A and 1B.

3.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
3.1 The Problem  Being  Addressed:  Limitations  of Conventional  Imaging  
Modalities  for Prostate  Cancer  Metastases  
 
Progressive  prostate  cancer  spreads  to bone  more  commonly  than to any other site,  yet 
monitoring  bone  metastases  to quantify  cancer regression  and progression  remains  
inconsistent  at best.  In addition,  a significant  percentage  of patients  have  soft tissue,  
predominant  nodal  disease.  The standard  Phase  II response  criteria  for solid tumors  do 
not apply,  and despite  the rapid  evolution  of imaging  modal ities for prostate  cancer,  
visualizing  of tumor spread  to bone  is still in the early stages  of development.  For 
example,  as seen  on plain radiographs,  when  prostate  cancer  spreads  to bone,  tumor  
growth  in the marrow  results  in osteoblastic  changes,  which,  in the end stage,  result  in the 
complete  replacement  of the marrow  space.  While  most  physicians  accept  that sclerotic  
healing  of a lytic lesion  constitutes  tumor regression,  sequential  monitoring  of lesions  that 
are initially sclerotic  is problematic  because  the bone  architecture  rarely  reverts  
histologically  back  to normal.  Even  if all tumor cells  are destroyed,  there  may be no visible  
changes  on standard  scans.  In these  cases,  only a direct  biopsy  can determine  if viable  
tumor  cells are present.  Other  imaging  modalities  have  significant  limitations  in identifying  
viable  tumor  as described  below.   Immunotherapy,  radioimmunotherapy  or antibody  drug 
conjugate  (ADC)  related  therapy are  dependent  on targeted  antigen  concentration.  While  
patients  may be selected  based  on antigen  expression  based  on tumor  biopsy,  this is an 
invasive  technique  and is limited  by impracticality  of multiple  tumor  biopsy.  In contrast,  
using  a radiolabeled  antibody  approach  allows  one to non invasively select  patients  based  
on antigen  content  and allows  assessment  of multiple  tumor sites.

Imaging  modalities  in prostate  cancer  
 
3.1.1  Radionuclide  bone  scanning  
 
In prostate  cancer,  bone  scintigraphy,  although  useful  for staging,  has limited  
usefulness  because  rather than  providing  a direct  measure  of cancer activity,  it reflects  
the reaction  of bone  to the surrounding  cancer.  In addition,  the common  occurrence  of 
the flare phenomenon  (a paradoxical  increase  in intensity  after successful  therapy)  
complicates  the interpretation  of scans  on a serial  basis.  
 
 
3.1.2  Cross -sectional  imaging  
 
The cross -sectional  imaging  modalities  that are used  to evaluate  prostate  cancer  
include  CT, magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI),  and the emerging  technology  of 
magnetic  resonance  spectroscopy  (MRS).  The utility  of each  of these  modalities  varies  
according  to the stage  of disease.  At present,  no modality  can distinguish  viable  
disease  from necrotic  or nonmalignant  tissue.  
 
CT is well suited  for detecting  soft tissue  disease,  but has limited  utility  in assessing  
early  changes  in bone.  CT is not sensitive  enough  to detect  small  volume  nodal  
disease  or tumor in  non enlarged  lymph  nodes.  CT also does  not effectively  evaluate  
disease  that is confined  to the prostate  and adjacent  area.  
 
MRI:  To provide  the most  accurate  assessment  in the region  of the prostate,  
neurovascular  bundles,  and seminal  vesicles,  MRI is considered  the modality  of 
choice.  In addition,  MRI can detect  soft tissue  disease  and is most  useful  to 
corroborate  bone  scintigraphy findings  (particularly  when  the earliest  involvement  is 
thought  to be present  in the bone  marrow).  MRI is most  sensitive  in the axial skeleton  
and pelvis,  and is less effective  in the ribs, chest  wall, and skull.  
 
 
3.2 Positron  Emission  Tomography  (PET)  
 
PET has advantages  over conventional  imaging  methods  because  it quantitatively  
assesses  biologic  processes  in vivo and can assess  different  processes  using  specific  
radiotracers.  Processes  that can be analyzed  with currently  available  reagents  include  
glucose  and amino  acid metabolism and  proliferation,  blood  flow, and receptor status  (i.e., 
androgen  receptor).  Most  studies  have focused  on the accumulation  of FDG.  
 
 
3.2.1  PET scanning  with fluorine -18-fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG)  
 
During  the past decade,  investigators  at MSKCC  have  shown  that PET imaging  in 
prostate  cancer can  be tested  prospectively  using  rigorous,  carefully  controlled  
standard  clinical  trial designs  traditionally  reserved  for therapeutics  (Morris,  Akhurst  et 
al. 2002 ; Morris,  Akhurst  et al. 2005 ). The method  has been  to enroll  patients  
registered  in therapeutic  clinical  trials to the imaging  trials to undergo  imaging  in 
conjunction  with their treatment.

IRB#:12 -178 A(3)   
  
 
 
3.2.1.1  FDG  PET and bone  metastases  
 
Previous  studies  found  that the sensitivity  of FDG PET for detecting  metastases  
was poor.  However,  these  were  not prospective,  and the populations  studied  were  
not controlled  for progression,  clinical  state,  or type  of treatment  (Apolo,  Pandit - 
Taskar  et al. 2008 ). These  trials demonstrated  the need  for rigorous  controls  in 
prostate  cancer clinical  trials  of new tracers.  To that end, we examined  a uniform  
cohort  of patients  with progressive  metastatic  prostate  cancer.  We tracked  each  
bone  lesion  from inception  to progression,  starting  with 1 scan  before  baseline  and 
2 follow -up scans  after baseline,  if feasible.  FDG PET was sensitive  enough  to 
identify  active  disease  and distinguish  it from quiescent  or noncancerous  lesions  
(Morris,  Akhurst  et al. 2002 ). 
 
3.2.1.2  FDG  PET and evaluation  of treatment  effect  
 
In our prospective  study,  FDG  PET captured,  in a single  imaging  modality,  the 
information  usually  captured  by the standard  composite  clinical  endpoint  of PSA,  
bone  scintigraphy,  and soft tissue  imaging.  Twenty -two patients  with castrate  
metastatic  prostate  cancer  registered  to clinical  trials  of anti-microtubule  
chemotherapy also  participated  in our imaging  study.  We followed  them to  either  
progression  or death.  After 4 weeks  of chemotherapy,  FDG  PET and PSA were  in 
agreement  in 86% of cases;  in 91% of cases,  FDG PET correctly  identified  
whether  the patient’s  disease  was progressing.  After  12 weeks  of therapy,  FDG  
PET, PSA,  and standard  imaging  were  compared.  PET correctly  identified  the 
clinical  status  in 94% of cases.  These  data suggest  that FDG  PET,  when  studied  
prospectively  in a population  rigorously  controlled  for clinical  state  and disease  
progression,  can effectively  demonstrate  treatment  effects (Morris,  Akhurst  et al. 
2005 ). FDG  PET can demonstrate  marked  posttreatment  changes  in response  to 
chemothera py similar to PSA,  furnishes  information  regarding  tumor  metabolism,  
and demonstrates  antitumor effects  on a lesional  basis.  By contrast,  simultaneous  
bone  scintigraphy  demonstrates  no such  effects  and is nearly  useless  in 
demonstrating  post-treatment  changes.  
 
 
3.2.2  STEAP1  antigen  and MSTP2109A  antibody  
 
Six-transmembrane  epithelial  antigen  of the prostate -1 (STEAP1)   is a multi - 
transmembrane,  cell-surface  antigen  of unknown  function  that is overexpressed  
in  85%  of human  epithelial  prostate  cancers,  and low and restricted  expression  
only in normal  prostate  tissue  (Hubert,  Vivanco  et al. 1999 ; Challita -Eid, Morrison  
et al. 2007 ). 
 
Genentech  has developed  a humanized  anti-STEAP1  monoclonal  lgG1  
antibody  MSTP2109A  that recognizes  this antigen.  An anti-mitotic  agent  
monome thyl auristatin  E (MMAE)  based  ADC  DSTP3086S  has been  developed  
by Genentech,  and is currently  under clinical  evaluation  in a multicenter clinical  
trial in which  MSKCC  is participating.  The ADC  as a therapy  takes  advantage  of 
the targeting  capability  of the antibody  and the cytotoxic  activity  of MMAE,  
which  binds  to microtubules  and disrupts  the microtubule  network.  Following  
antigen -specific  binding  of the ADC,  the complex  of the target  antigen  and the 
conjugate  is internalized  and MMAE  or MMAE -containing  catabolites  are

 released  intracellularly,   resulting  in inhibition  of cell division  and growth,  and 
culminating  in cell death  (Doronina,  Toki et al. 2003 ; Francisco,  Cerveny et al. 
2003 ). It is anticipated  that presence  of the antigen  is a prerequisite  for tumor  
targeting  and delivery of  the toxic pay load.   We believe  that it would  be useful  to 
evaluate  a radiolabeled anti-STEAP1  antibody  to determine  the presence  and 
intensity  of target  antigen  on prostate  tumors,  in vivo. 
 
Both the anti-STEAP1  antibody,  MSTP2109A,  and its ADC  showed  similar  and 
high binding  activity (low nanomolar) to human  and cynomolgus  monkey  STEAP1  
but no binding  to rat or mouse  STEAP1  orthologues. The pharmacokinetics  and 
disposition   of unconjugated  antibody  and its ADC  are driven  mainly  by the 
anti-STEAP1  antibody  component  and expected  to be similar  between  
antibody  and ADC.  
 
The pharmacokinetics  of anti-STEAP1  antibody,  MSTP2109A  and its conjugate  
DSTP3086A  were  linear  in both rats and non-tumor  bearing  mice,  as expected  for 
non-binding  species.  DSTP3086A  also demonstrated  linearity  in cynomolgus  
monkeys   (a binding  species)  over the tested  dose  range  i.e., 0.3-5.0 mg/kg),  
which  is expected  given  the non-detectable  level of STEAP1  expression   in normal  
tissues.  
 
MSTP2109A  has been  used  in humans  as the targeting  moiety  of an antibody  drug 
conjugate  (ADC  DSPT3086S)  that is being  used  in a Phase  1 trial at MSKCC..   The 
Anti-STEAP1  intact  antibody  MSTP2109A   has not been  used  in humans.  Safety  
data in non-human  primates  and rodent  are available for both the antibody  
MSTP2109A  and the antibody drug conjugate  DSPT3086S.   Anti-STEAP1  antibody  
MSTP2109A  was included  in non-GLP toxicity  studies  in both Sprague -Dawley rats 
and in cynomolgus  monkeys.  Single  doses  of 60 mg/kg  MSTP2109A  in rats and 2 
doses  every  3 weeks  of 24 mg/kg  MSTP2109A  exhibited  no toxicologically  
significant  changes compared  to vehicle  control.  
 
The primary  safety  signal  identified  for the anti-STEAP1  ADC  DSTP3086S  in 
cynomolgus  monkeys  and rats was bone  marrow  toxicity,  specifically  dose - 
dependent,  reversible  neutropenia.  The toxicity  findings  with the ADC  were  
consistent  with the mechanism   of action  (microtubule  inhibition)  of the cytotoxic  
component  (MMAE)  of DSTP3086S,  and were  considered  to be MMAE  specific  
and independent  of STEAP1  target.  
 
A toxicity  study  in mice  using  our DFO -MSTP2109A formulation  at 50 mg/kg  did not 
show  toxicity  ( no observable  effect  level).  
 
The drug conjugate  DSTP3086S  has been  used  in 26 patients  as of 08/22/2012  as 
part of an ongoing Phase  I multi -center  clinical  trial - MSKCC  protocol 11 -016. 
Currently,  enrollment  is occurring at 2.8 mg/kg.  Only  two DLT have  been  observed  
consisting  of transaminitis  at the 2.25 mg/kg,  and elevated liver  enzymes  in a 
patient  treated  at a dose  level  of 2.8 mg/kg.  Reversible liver  toxicity  was observed  
in pre-clinical assessments  with DSTP3086A and  likely  represents  toxicity  
attributable  to the drug conjugate  Otherwise,  treatments  have  been very  well 
tolerated  with very  mild side effects  possibly  related  to treatment  such  as Gr1 
hypotension  constipation  or diarrhea.  Other  89Zr-labeled  antibodies  have  been  used  
in patients  with good  tumor  localization  and tolerated  well (Borjesson,  Jauw  et al. 
2006 ; Borjesson,  Jauw  et al. 2009 ; Dijkers,  Munnink  et al. 2010 ). As of date, the  
protocol  conti nues  to accrue.

3.2.2.1  89Zirconium  
89Zr is an attractive  metallo -radionuclide  for use in immuno -PET due to favorable  
decay  characteristics.  It has a 78.4h  half life and a 22.7%  positron  yield.  
 
Standardized  methods  for the routine  production  and isolation  of high-purity  and 
high-specific -activity  89Zr using  a small  cyclotron are  reported.  Optimized  cyclotron  
conditions  reveal  high average  yields  of 1.52 ± 0.11 mCi/muA*h  at a proton  beam  
energy  of 15 MeV and current  of 15 muA using  a solid,  commercially available  89Y- 
foil target  (0.1 mm, 100%  natural  abundance).  89Zr was isolated  in high 
radionuclidic  and radiochemical  purity  (>99.99%)  as (89Zr)Zr -oxalate  by using  a 
solid-phase  hydroxamate  resin  with >99.5% recovery of the radioactivity.  The 
effective specific  activity  of 89Zr was found  to be in  the range  of 5.28 −13.43  
mCi/microg  (470 −1195  Ci/mmol)  of zirconium.  
 
New methods  for the facile  production  of (89Zr) Zr-chloride  are reported.  
Radiolabeling  studies  using  the trihydroxamate  ligand  desferrioxamine  B (DFO)  
gave  100% radiochemical  yields  in <15 min at room temperature,  and in vitro 
stability  measurements  confirmed  that (89Zr) Zr -DFO  is stable with respect  to ligand  
dissociation  in human  serum  for >7 days.  Small -animal  PET imaging  studies  have  
demonstrated  that free 89Zr (IV) ions  administered  as (89Zr) Zr-chloride  accumulate  
in the liver, whilst  (89Zr) Zr -DFO  is excreted  rapidly  via the kidneys  within  <20 min. 
 
These  results  have  important  implications  for the analysis  of immuno -PET imaging  
of 89Zr-labeled  monoclonal  antibodies.  The detailed  methods  described  can be 
easily  translated  to other radiochemistry  facilities  and will facilitate  the use of 89Zr in 
both basic  science  and clinical  investigation s (Holland,  Sheh  et al. 2009 ; Holland,  
Caldas -Lopes  et al. 2010 ; Holland,  Divilov et al. 2010; Holland,  Divilov et al. 2010 ). 
 
 
3.2.3  Pharmacokinetic  and biodistribution  of chimeric  or humanized  
monoclonal  antibodies.  
 
We have  based  our antibody  mass  dose  selection  on the lack of cross  reactivity  of the 
STEAP1  antigen  in normal  human  tissues.  Furthermore  we have  drawn  on the 
experience  with various other antibodies  to select  our initial  mass  of DFO - 
MSTP2109A.  The pharmacokinetics  of a variety  of radiolabeled  antibodies  has been  
determined  in humans.  Some  antibodies  have  cross  reactivity  with normal  antigens  in 
vivo and thus require  a certain mass  amount  in order to optimize  pharmacokinetics   
and biodistribution.  As an example  clinical  trials  with 89Zr trastuzumab  have  shown  that 
mass  of about  50 mg is necessary in  trastuzumab  naïve  patients.  In contrast,  studies  
with the chimeric  89Zr-cmAb  U36 found  adequate targeting  when  using  10 mg of the 
IgG. We have  utilized  PET imaging  of I-124 anti huA33  antibody  to target  A33 antigen,  
a transmembrane  glycoprotein  with homology  to tight junction -associated  proteins  that 
is present  in normal  colon  and small  bowel  epithelium  as well as in over 95% of human  
colon  adenocarcinoma  and approximately  50% of gastric  and  pancreatic  cancers,  
while  absent  in most  other  human  tissues  and tumors  (Sakamoto,  Kojima  et al. 2000 ). 
Our studies  utilizing  10 mg of  I-124 A33 have  shown  excellent  targeting  and have  
demonstrated  Vd close  to that of plasma  3,257 + 631 mL, T1/2 of ~ 65 h and Co of 
~31.9%ID/L  (Carrasquillo,  Pandit -Taskar et al. 2011 ). In our experience  the use of 10 
mg of I-124 chimeric  antibody  cG250  resulted  in excellent  imaging  of renal  cell tumors  
Amended:  09/02/15  Page  12 of 36 
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER

IRB#:12 -178 A(3)   
 (Divgi,  Pandit -Taskar et  al. 2007 ). The pharmacokinetic  analysis  in a clinical  trial that 
used  2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 mg of I-131 cG250  showed  that at the 2  mg dose  levels  there  
was faster clearance  but at all other  levels  there  was no dose  response  with a median  
T1/2 of 68.5 h. When doses  of 25 and 50 mg of cG250  were  administered  there  was 
less tumor uptake  than at the 10 mg dose  (Steffens,  Boerman  et al. 1997 ). Humanized  
antibody  hPAM4  specifically  binds  a mucin  glycoprotein  expressed  in pancreatic  
adenocarcinomas.  A clinical  trial using  In-111 hPAM4   showed  good targeti ng and 
similar  pharmacokinetics  of doses  ranging  from < 10 mg compared  to 100 mg (Gulec,  
Cohen  et al. 2011 ) with T1/2 of 91.2h.  An ongoing  clinical  trial using  I-124 GC33  
humanized  antibody  in patients  with hepatocellular  carcinoma,  being  perfor med at 
MSKCC  by Ghassan  Abou -Alfa and Jorge  A. Carrasquillo  has shown  good  targeting  at 
doses  of 10 mg (unpublished  observation).  In contrast,  at considerably  higher  doses  of 
GC33  (390 mg) tumor uptake  was significantly  blocked,  down  to 1/3 of that seen  with 
the 10 mg dose  (SUV  21versus  7). Therefore  it is expected  that antibodies that have  
little cross  reactivity  with normal  tissue  will exhibit  favorable  pharmacokinetic  for tumor  
imaging  with mass  amount  of approximately 10 mg. 
 
 
3.2.4  Rationale  for 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  PET use in prostate  cancer  
 
Various  radionuclides  are available  to label  monoclonal  antibody  for imaging,  
pharmacokinetics  and biodistribution.  Antibodies  labeled  with positron  emitters  have  
significant  advantage  compared  to single  photon  emitters.  These  include  the higher  
sensitivity,  spatial  resolution  of PET and its quantitative  ability.  At MSKCC  we have  
used  various  positron  emitters  for labeling  antibodies.  I-124 has been  used  by our 
group  and is a good isotope  for labeling  non internalizing  antibodies.  Other groups  
have  pioneered  the use of 89Zr  labeled  antibodies  and its successful  use in patients  
has been  reported  (Borjesson,  Jauw  et al. 2006 ; Dijkers,  Munnink  et al. 2010 ). It is well 
known  that for antibodies  that internalize  there  is significant  improved  retention  of radio  
metals  compared  to Iodinated  antibodies  (Naruki,  Carrasquillo  et al.  1990 ). 89Zr has an 
ideal  half-life that is well matched  to the half life of intact  IgG. Correlating  STEAP1  
tumor targeting  with the response  to DSTP3086S may allow  for optimal  patient  
selection.  Furthermore  from this  study  we will determine  the ability  of 89Zr-DFO - 
MSTP2109A  to identify  metastatic  castrate  resistant  prostate  cancer.  This may allow  us 
to perform future  studies  to phenotype  the cancer (FDG,  PSMA,  STEAP1  and 
androgen  receptor status)  and may have  a potential  role in other drug  development.  
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
Patients  with progressive  castrate  resistant  metastatic  prostate  cancer  are eligible  to 
register  for this study,  providing  all other  eligibility  criteria  are met. Patients  can be co- 
registered  to therapeutic  clinical  trials,  but may not receive  any therapeutic  treatments  
associated  with those  trials  within  4 weeks  prior to  our imaging  study.  
 
We have  based  our selection  of a 10 mg starting  dose  on the lack of cross  reactivity  of the 
STEAP1  antigen  in normal  human  tissues  and work with other  antibodies  reported  in the 
literature.   Cross -reactivity  of MSTP2109A  antibody  with normal  and binding  affinity  was 
similar  between  cynomolgus  monkey  and human,  the cynomolgus  monkey  serves  as a 
pharmacologically  relevant  model  to predict  human  pharmacokinetics.  DSTP3086A  
demonstrated  pharmacokinetic linearity  in cynomolgus  monkey over the tested  dose  
range  of 0.3-5.0 mg/kg.  Therefore  it is expected  that there  will be no antibody  sink to

Amended:  09/02/15  Page  13 of 36  
 rapidly  clear  the antibody  injected.  An amount  of 10 mg is expected  to be adequate  for 
tumor  imaging.  The rationale  for 10 mg is based  on the fact that this is an amount  that  
has been  used  successfully  with other  antibodies  that have minimal  or minor  cross  
reactivity  with normal  tissues  in vivo (Divgi,  Pandit -Taskar et  al. 2007 ; Carrasquillo,  Pandit - 
Taskar  et al. 2011 ). Nonetheless,  since  no pharmacokinetic  or imagi ng studies  have  been  
performed  with 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A,  initial  studies  must  determine  an acceptable  mass  
for imaging.  In order to streamline  antibody  mass  selection,  initial  Cohort  1A patients  (up  
to 6 in cohort) will receive  10 mg of 89Zr  -DFO -MSTP2109A  and will undergo  
pharmacokinetics  and serial  imaging.  Decision  of whether  to study  a second  cohort,   
Cohort  1B,  at a higher  dose  (20 mg) will be based  predominantly  on the basis  of whether  
adequate  tumor targeting  is observed  (tumor detection  in >75% of STEAP1  positive  
patients).  As secondary  measure  we will evaluate  for unexpected  normal  organ  
accumulation,  based  on PET imaging  and evidence  of rapid  plasma  clearance  based  on 
pharmacokinetic  parameters  and tumor targeting.  If adequate  tumor targeting  is achieved  
we will use the starting  dose  of 10 mg in patients  enrolled  in Cohort  2. The absence  of 
antigen  sink may be confirmed  if pharmacokinetics  show  Vd of less than 3 times  plasma  
volume,  T1/2 is greater  than 50 h and if visually  there  is no binding  to normal  tissues above  
that expected  from blood  pool.   If there  is suggestion  of antigen  sink, and           
inadequate  tumor  targeting,  we will evaluate  an additional  6 patients  who will receive  total 
dose  of 20 mg (Cohort  1B). The patients  in Cohort  1B also will undergo  pharmacokinetics,  
imaging  and whole  body  measurements  as outlined for the 10 mg cohort  in section  9.0. 
Once  the milligram  dose  to be administered  is selected,  a second  group  of patient s 
(Cohort  2) consisting  of up to 15 patients  will be enrolled,  that will have  only 1 whole -body  
scan,  at a time point  to be determined  based  on the results  of Cohort  1A or 1B patients.  
 
Because 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  has not been  evaluated in  patients,  toxicity  assessment  
will be performed  using  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  v4. 
 
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
The intervention  is the administration  of a single  dose  of the 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  tracer  
for imaging  purposes.  In Cohort  1A or 1B,  after administration  of the experimental  tracer,  
the patient  will undergo  up to four PET scans  during  the 7 days  post injection,  whole  body  
probe  measurements  and pharmacokinetics.  In Cohort  2, patients  will undergo  injection  of 
89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A, and  they will undergo  one PET scan  from top of skull to mid thigh  
(this may be adjusted  based  on known  extent  of disease)  and no pharmacokinetics  will be 
performed.  The primary  population  will be those  who are planning  to enroll  in the 
therapeutic  trial using  DSTP3086S  (11-016),  although  for Cohort  1A, 1B and potentially  
Cohort  2 patients  that meet  the inclusion  criteria  may be enrolled  even  if not considered  
for DSTP3086S  therapy.  No clinical  management  decisions  will be made  based  on 89Zr 
DFO - MSTP2109A  imaging.  Patients  may not be re-imaged  on this trial. 
 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
 
MSTP2109A is  a humanized  antibody  that targets  STEAP1  that will be labeled  with 89Zr. We will 
use 89Zr, a positron -emitting  radionuclide,  labeled to MSTP2109A via DFO.  This protocol  will 
explore  the feasibility  of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  PET imaging;  the tracer’s  pharmacokinetic  (PK) 
and biodistribution  properties;  its ability  to detect  disease  relative  to standard  imaging  modalities.

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
Recruitment Plan  (with  Limited  Waiver  of Authorization)  
A member of the 11-016 clinical  trial or the patient’s  treatment  team  at MSKCC  will identify  
potential  study  participants.   Men of all races  and ethnic  groups  will be considered  for study  
participation.   Candidates  must  conform to all inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  to be accepted  into 
the study.  
If the investigator  is a membe r of the treatment  team,  s/he will screen  their patients’  medical  
records  for suitable  research  study  participants  and discuss  the study  and their potential  for 
enrolling  in the research  study.   Potential  subjects  contacted  by their treating  physician  will be 
referred  to the investigator/  research  staff of the study.  
The principal  investigator may  also screen  the medical  records  of patients  with whom  they do not 
have  a treatment  relationship  for the limited  purpose  of identifying  patients  who would  be eligible  
to enroll  in the study  and to record  appropriate  contact  information  in order to approach  these  
patients  regarding  the possibility of enrolling  in the study.  
During  the initial  conversation  between  the investigator/  research  staff and the patient,  the patient  
may be asked  to provide  certain  health  information  that is necessary  to the recruitment  and 
enrollment  process.  The investigator/  research  staff may also review  portions  of their medical  
records  at MSKCC  in order to further assess  eligibility.   They  will use the information  provided  by 
the patient  and/or  medical  record  to confirm that  the patient  is eligible  and to contact  the patient  
regarding  study  enrollment.  If the patient  turns  out to be ineligible for the research  study,  the 
research  staff will destroy  all information  collected  on the patient  during  the initial  conversation  
and medical  records  review,  except  for any information  that must  be maintained  for screening  log 
purposes.  
In most  cases,  the initial  contact  with the prospective  subject  will be conducted  by either  the 
treatment  team,  investigator or the research  staff working  in consultation  with the treatment  team.  
The recruitment  process  outlined  presents  no more  than minimal  risk to the privacy  of the patients  
who are screened  and minimal  protected  health  information  (PHI)  will be maintained  as part of a 
screening  log.  For these  reasons,  we seek  a (partial)  limited  waiver  of authorization for the 
purposes  of (1) reviewing  medical  records  to identify  potential  research  subjects  and obtain  
information  relevant  to the enrollment  process;  (2) conversing  with patients  regarding  possible  
enrollment;  (3) handling  of PHI contained  within  those  records  and provided  by the potential  
subjects;  and (4) maintaining  information  in a screening  log of patients  approached  (if applicable).

9.1 TREATMENT/ INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
9.2 Pharmacokinetics  
 
Patients  are not required  to fast before  89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  injection  or imaging.  
 
Catheter insertion  and Pharmacokinetics  
 
If feasible,  2 intravenous catheters  (Hep -Lock) will be placed  by staff in the Nuclear  
Medicine  department  for radiopharmaceutical  administration  and blood  sampling,  or 
alternatively  a central  line may be used  for injection  or sampling.  The intravenous  catheter  
will be removed  at the conclusion  of the imaging  session.   If two  lines are not feasible,  one 
line will be used  for both injection  and PK sampling  with intervening  10 cc saline  flush  and 
change  of catheter  hub. Patients  in Cohort  2 (no pharmacokinetics,  will not require  a 
second  catheter).  
 
89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A : To determine  clearance  and for metabolite  analysis  of the drug,  
Cohort  1A and 1B patients (up  to 6 patients  per cohort)  receiving  89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  
will have  serial  blood  samples  drawn.   Blood  samples  will be obtained  in green  top tube:  
• Just prior to injection of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  (baseline)  
• Approximately 5 ± 2, 15 ± 5, 30 ± 9, 60 ± 19, and 120 to 240 minutes  after 
injection  of the tracer.  
• One sample  at the time of each  subsequent  day of imaging  (24 + 8h, ~48-96h 
and ~120 -168h  post injection).  
 
 
These  data are used  to determine  the time-activity  curves  for plasma  (% injected  
dose/liter).   Blood  is centrifuged,  and the plasma pipetted  and counted.   Samples may be 
tested  for breakdown  products  by TCA or HPLC.  Blood  will also be aliquoted  for 
sampling,  if in the first 3 patients  no binding  is observed  to blood  elements  only plasma  
sampling  will be counted  in subsequent  patients.  
 
For each  blood  sample,  4-6 mL of blood  will be drawn  in green  top tubes.  
 
Patients  in Cohort  2 will undergo  injection  and 1 imaging  session,  but no pharmacokinetics  
will be performed.

9.3 Imaging  
 
89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  
Radiolabeling  of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A:  The DFO -MSTP2109A  will be labeled  in 
accordance  with the MSKCC  investigator sponsored IND.  The study  will be performed  
under  an FDA approved  IND for 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A,  no studies  will be performed  until 
the IND is approved.   The final product  will contain  up to 5 mCi and will have  been  brought  
up to desired  total antibody  quantity  (e.g. 10 or 20  mg) of DFO -MSTP2109A  by adding  
cold carrier  dfo-MSTP2109A  as outlined  in the design  section.   The product  will have  met 
the release  criteria  specified  in the IND. Immunoreactivity   and sterility  assays  will be 
performed  post release.  
 
The investigational  product  label  will include  the patient  name,  MRN  and the calibration  
date and time.  The investigational  product  is to be used  within  8 hours  of manufacturing.  
 
PET scanning:  In order to provide  reproducible  clinical  data,  we will acquire  all 89Zr-DFO - 
MSTP2109A  PET scans  on the GE PET-CT scanner  DSTE  at MSKCC  or the same  or a 
newer  generation  scanner.  Once  a study  is begun  in one scanner,  it will be continued  on 
the same  scanner unless  malfunction/emergency  issues  prevent  this.  Intravenous  
injection  of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A (maximum  of 5 mCi ± 10%) will be given  over 5-15 
minutes.   Initially  we will start with ~ 5 mCi of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A;  the activity may be 
adjusted  downward  based  on visual  review  of image  quality.   A PET-CT scan  extending  
from top of skull to mid thighs  will be performed  to determine  the biodistribution.  The low 
dose  CT portion  of the 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A  on the first day will utilize  80 mA (low mA) 
and on subsequent  days,  we will use 10 mA in order  to minimize  radiation  exposure.  In 
order to minimize  imaging  time,  lower  limbs  will be included  only for patients  with known  
lesions  in lower  limbs  on previous  imaging  and if at least  5 other  lesions  are not identified  
in the torso.  
 
Active  lesions   will be identified  (Nuclear Medicine  investigator  and MM) based  on 
conventional  images  and those  thought  to represent  active  disease  based  on review of the 
patients  conventional  images  and treatment  history  (ie external  radiation)  will be 
considered  as lesions  for determination  of antibody  localization.  A lesion   will be 
considered  present  if there  is greater  localization  than that expected  based  on blood  pool 
distribution  of the tracer.   Given  that at present  we do not know  the heterogeneity  of the 
antigen  between  lesions or  between  primary  and metastatic  disease  a patient  will be 
considered positive  if any  of the active  lesions  are identified  with the 89Zr-DFO - 
MSTP2109A  . We will, nonetheless  tabulate  the number of lesions  and their status  based  
on 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A.  When  pathologic  material  that has been evaluated  for the 
presence  of STEAP1  is available  for any specific  lesion,  we will correlate  the presence  of 
STEAP1  with imaging  results.  
 
Patients  in Cohort  1A (and if performed  Cohort  1B) will also have  imaging  at 4 time points  
post-injection  to allow  for selection  of optimal  imaging  time and dosimetry  determination.  
For these  patients,  top of skull to mid thigh  scans will be acquired:  
 
• Within  one to four hours  following  injection  of tracer  on Day 1 
• ~24 ± 8hours  post-injection  (Day  2) 
• ~48−96 hours  post-injection  (once  during  Days  3−5) 
• ~120 −168 hours  post injection  (once  during  Days  6−8)

Images  will be analyzed  with ROI and SUVmean  and max measurements  will be obtained.  
The serial  quantitative  data obtained  over the various  organs  of interest  (heart,  liver, 
spleen,  kidney,  lung and any other  organ  that exhibits  uptake  will be collected.  These   
data can then be utilized  to determine  organ  time activity  curves  and the dosimetry can  be 
calculated.  Uptake  and clearance  values  will be summarized  using  descriptive  statistics  
(mean,  median  standard  deviation.   Once  the biodistribution  and pharmacokinetics  have  
been  characterized,  subsequent  patients  will not require  serial  imaging  and 
pharmacokinetics,  but rather will have  a single  scan  at an optimal  time point  determined  
based  on the patients in  cohort  1A and or cohort  1B. We will determine  the time at which  
the greatest  number  of lesions  are seen.  This is likely  to be between  3-8 days,  but choice  
will be based  on the first Cohort  1 patients’  data,  using  the most  frequent  day at which  the 
most  lesions  are seen  and/or at  times  at which  best contrast is  observed  determined  
visually.   Thus,  for the remainder  of the patients  in Cohort  2, PET scan  will be performed  
once.  The timing  of this scan  will be determined  based  on findings  from Cohort  1A and/or  
1B, as described  above.  
 
Infusion  reactions  with MSTP2109A  intact  IgG have  not been  evaluated.  Infusion  reaction  
to the ADC  DSTP3086S  antibody  drug conjugate  in 18 patient  treated  thus far have  been  
minor  and not clinically significant  (i.e. none  or Gr1).In  the event  of fever,  rigors,  shortness  
of breath,  or other evidence  of infusion  reaction,  patients  may receive  diphenhydramine  
25-50 mg IV and Tylenol  650 mg PO as felt to be clinically  appropriate  by the treating  
physician.   The emission  data are typically acquired  for 3−10 minutes  per bed position  
depending  upon  the time post-injection  and visual  quality  of the images.  Index  lesions  will 
be identified  based  on the patient’s  conventional  diagnostic  imaging.  
 
Images  will be stored  as Digital  Imaging  and Communications  in Medicine  (DICOM)  on the 
PACS  and HERMES.   Images  to be sent out to Genentech  will be burned  on a CD or 
equivalent  by patient.   All images  will be anonymized  according  to institutional  policy  with 
the patients  code  used  as identifiers.  
 
No decision  on the patients’  health  care management  will be made  on the basis  of 
Imaging  with 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A.  
 
9.4 Whole  body  probe  measurements  (Cohort  1) 
 
Patients  in Cohort  1 will undergo  whole  body  dose  measurement  using  a NaI probe  placed  
at ~3 meters  from the patient.  These  measurements  will be performed  the day of  
injection of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  before  voiding  and after first void, and at each  time the 
patient  returns  for imaging  (typically  less than 5 minutes).  
 
9.5 Assessment  for Toxicity  
 
Safety  Outcome  Measures  (CTCAE  v4) 
Infusion  Reaction  
Patients  will be monitored  during  and after 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  infusion  for 90 
minutes  after the infusion.   Patients  who experience  infusion -related  symptoms  should  
be managed  as directed  in Table  1. 
 
The safety  and tolerability  of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  wi l l be assessed  using  the 
following  primary  safety  outcome  measure:

Symptoms  Guidance  
Grade  1 • Slow  or hold infusion  
• Give supportive  treatment  
• Upon  symptom  resolution,  may resume  infusion  rate escalation  
at the investigator’s  discretion  
Grade  2 • Slow  or hold infusion  
• Give supportive  treatment  
• Upon  symptom  resolution,  may resume  infusion -rate escalation  
at the investigator’s  discretion  
Grade  3 or Grade  4 • Discontinue  infusion  
• Give supportive  treatment  
Patient  may be imaged  if sufficient  tracer  has been  administered  and 
the patient  is stable,  at the discretion  of the administering  investigator.  
 
Given  that this is a humanized  antibody  and the antibody  will be administered  only once  
under this  protocol  the likelyhood  of development   of human  anti human  antibody  is low. 
Patients  enrolled,   who are being  treated  with the ADC  under  protocol  11-016 will be 
monitored  for the presence  of anti-ADC  antibodies  as is currently  stated in  that study.  
Thus  the presence,  if any,  of anti MSTP2109A,  that would  potentially  interfere  with ADC  
targeting  will be evaluated  in those  patient  on protocol  11-016.  Baseline  serum and  4-6 
wk post infusion  serum  (serum separator  or red top tube)  will be collected  and banked  for 
future  determination  of HAHA  response  as requested  by the FDA (Dr.  Carrasquillo  lab, 
storage  approximately  -70oC). 
 
10.0   EVALUATION  DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
Laboratory  Safety  Assessments  
 
Blood  testing:  
Hematology  and blood  chemistry  assessments  (CBC,  PSA,  serum  BUN,  creatinine,  AST,  ALT,  
total bilirubin,  alkaline  phosphatase,  albumin,  blood  glucose  levels,  and serum  testosterone  level)  
will be done  at the time points  described  in Table  2. Additional  blood  tests  may also be performed  
at the discretion  of the investigator  for the purposes  of planning  treatment  administration,  dose  
modification,  or investigation  and follow -up of adverse  events.  These  additional  tests  will not be 
documented  in the CRF.  
Serum  samples  collected  from baseline  and 4-6 weeks  after administration  of DFO-MSTP2109A  
will be stored  to assay  for immune  response  to  89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  (assay  to be 
developed).This  assay  may be done  in house  or shipped  to Genentech  for processing.

11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Risks  
 
89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  PET/CT  Scans  
As part of this scan  there  is radiation  delivered from the 89Zr and from the  low dose  CT scan  that 
are performed  as part of the CT for attenuation  correction  and co-registration.  Although  any 
exposure  to ionizing  radiation  has the potential  to cause  some  harm to tissue,  the radiation  
exposures  in this study  are comparable  to the low-level exposures  associated  with common  
diagnostic  procedures  such  as CT scanning.  There  remains  a low theoretical  risk of developing  a 
cancer  at some  point  later in life as a result  of the radiation  exposure  received  in this study.  This 
risk is particularly  low for adults  given  the fact that the radiation  from the scans  will be over 
several  weeks.  Participants  should  not father a baby while  on this study.  Acceptable  birth control  
methods  include  abstinence,  double  barrier method,  surgically  sterilized  patient  or partner.  This 
risk is much  smaller that  the clinical  risks posed  by the patient’s  current  cancer.  
 
DFO -MSTP2109A  
 
Potential  risks associated  with DFO -MSTP2109A  are similar to those  of other  humanized  
antibody  and include  allergic  reactions,  characterized  by fever,  chills,  and sometimes  rashes  or 
hives.   Less  likely  shortness  of breath  can occur.  Rare  allergic  reactions  can present  as shock  or 
death  or swelling  of the throat.  Such  reactions  are usually  addressed  by stopping  the 
administration  of the drug,  administering  steroids,  acetaminophen  and/or diphenhydramine,  and 
restarting  the drug at a slower  rate if the reaction  is not severe.  
 
There  is a very small  risk of infection.  This could  cause  itching  or redness  at the area on the 
patient’s  arm where  the IV was placed.  89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  tracer

 Radiation  Dosimetry  
 
Normal -organ  radiation  absorbed  doses  and the effective dose  for 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  in 
human  were  estimated  based  on measured  time-activity  data in mice.  The time-activity  data 
(percent  of the injected  dose  per gram (%ID/gm)  versus  time (t) post -administration)  for each  
organ  were fit to an exponential  functions  and the resulting  function  were  analytically integrated  
(incorporating  the radioactive  decay  of 89Zr) to yield the residence  time (cumulated  activity)  of 89Zr 
in each  organ.  The mouse organ  89Zr residence  times  were  converted  to 89Zr residence  times  in 
human  organs  (for the 70-kg Standard  Man anatomic  model)  by adjusting  for the difference  in 
fractional  organ  masses  between  mice  and humans.  The resulting  human  residence  times  were  
then entered  into the OLINDA/EXM  radionuclide  dosimetry  program,  which  implements  the MIRD  
(Medical  Internal  Radionuclide  Dosimetry)  algorithm,  to yield the normal -organ  radiation  absorbed  
doses  (in rad) and effective  dose  (in rem) for 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A in  man.   Assuming  a 5-mCi 
administered  activity  of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  and a low-dose  (80 mA) and three  very-low-dose  
(10-mA) CT scans  are to be performed,  with approximate  CT effective  doses  of 0.90 rem and  
0.11 rem the radiation  dosimetry  is tabulated  below.

12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
Positive lesions  on 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  will be defined  visually as a focus  of  accumulation  of 
radioactivity  that is deemed  to not be physiologic  and is higher than  adjacent  or contralateral  
background.   Antibody  scan  will be read blinded from clinical  history  and conventional  imaging  
modalities. Two  different  experienced,  blinded  readers  will visually analyze  the 89Zr-DFO - 
MSTP2109A  scans,  and SUVmax/mean  will be determined  in lesions  identified  and in normal  
organs  and blood  pool.  To study  the accumulation  and biodistribution  of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  in 
patients  with progressive  prostate  cancer,  the accumulation of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  will be 
assessed  for each  site and compared  with the baseline  radionuclide  bone scan,  FDG PET/CT,  
CT, and/or  MRI imaging.  The definition  of a positive  lesion  will be a lesion  identified  by an 
experienced  reader on  conventional  imaging  CT/MRI,  bone  scan,  and/or  FDG  scan  consistent  
with metastatic  disease,  as is currently  done  clinically.   Lesions  on 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  or 
conventional  imaging  will be read in a scale  of 1 to 5, 1= negative,  2 = probably negative,  3= not  
sure,  4= probably  positive  and 5= definitively  positive.  Once  this is done,  a consensus  master  list 
of lesions  will be created  that compares  all imaging  conventional  imaging  modalities(CT/MRI,  
FDG  PET,  bone  scan),  only those  lesions  that are conspicuously  positive  (i.e., “4 or 5”) by  
imaging  will be considered  as a positive  site of disease.  Discrepant  findings  between  findings  on 
conventional imaging  and 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  modalities  will be considered  false  positive  or 
false  negative.   Although  it would  be ideal  to biopsy  any site that is considered  abnormal  this is 
not logistically  feasible  or ethically  acceptable.  Successful  imaging  will be considered  a sensitivity  
of detection  of > 75% of patients  that are STEAP1  positive.   One or 2 non-blinded  readers  
(access  to clinical,  laboratory  and imaging  data) will identify  “positive  lesions” . 
 
As a first level,  we will compare  site by site. Since  the individual  modalities  are based  on different  
mechanisms  of uptake,  they may not have  exact  correspondence  in space,  since  bone  scan  is a 
2D modality  and looks  at bone  reaction  and 89Zr looks  at tumor  antigen  expression  and is a 3D 
modality.  
 
For this  purpose,  we have  made  a list of standardized  anatomic  sites,  to make  sure that a positive  Muscle  1.21 6.05 7.25

 lesion would  have  a positive  89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  uptake.  As a second  level,  we will compare  
lesion  by lesion.  Sensitivity  and specificity  of the imaging  modalities  will be compared  in those  
patients  receiving  the better/”adequate”  antibody  mass.  The “better/adequate” dose  is defined  as 
that which  will allow  us to visualize  the targeted  number of lesions  defined  and will consist  of 
either  10 or 20  mg of DFO -MSTP2109A  antibody.  
 
12.1 Bone  Scan  
 
Each  lesion  will be evaluated  using  the same  5-point  scale.  These  findings  will be 
compared  with that of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  PET scanning.  
 
Any discrepant  reading  of the antibody  images  or conventional   images  will require  review  
of the images  by both readers  who will discuss  and reach  a consensus,  if a consensus  
cannot  be reached  the finding  shall be considered  “not sure” and  categorized  as negative.  
 
 
 
12.2 CT and MRI 
 
Available  CT and/or  MRI imaging  done  clinically  will be used  as a correlative  diagnostic  
imaging tool  to compare  to results  of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A PET scanning.  Sensitivity  of 
89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A PET scanning  to detect  lesions  will be compared  with routine  
imaging  including  CT, MRI, FDG  PET,  and bone  scans.  Furthermore  soft tissue  lesions  
greater  than 2 cm on CT or MRI will also be compared  to 89Zr -DFO -MSTP2109A  in order  
to overcome  the issues  of partial  volume.  
 
13.0 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
Participation  in the study  is strictly  voluntary.  Patients  have the right to withdraw  from the study  at 
any time.  If a patient  chooses  to withdraw,  he or she must  inform  the investigator immediately.  In 
addition,  the investigator  has the right to terminate  participation  of any patient  at any time if it is 
deemed  in the patient’s  best interest.  The reason and  circumstances  for premature  
discontinuation  will be documented  in the patient’s  medical  records.  Possible  examples for 
reasons  of premature  study withdrawal  include  withdrawal  of consent,  SAE or intolerable  AE, or 
any other medical  illness  at investigator’s  discretion.  
 
14.1 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
14.2 Primary  Objective  
 
The primary  objective  of this protocol  is to determine  the feasibility,  safety  and tolerability  
of single  dose  administration of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  antibody.  
A patient  with STEAP1  positive  tumor will be considered  antibody -imaging -positive  if 20% 
or more  of the active  lesions  are detectable  (STEAP1  positivity  is an eligibility  criterion  for 
protocol  11-016 which forms  the basis  of eligibility  for this protocol;  see section  6 for 
details).  Active  lesion  means  any lesion  that was identified  by conventional  imaging  
methods and  clinical  data at baseline.  We have  selected  a low threshold  of  20% for this 
first imaging  study  for 3 reasons:  1) we do not know  what the heterogeneity  of antigen  
expression  is within  a number of lesions  in the same  patient;  2) we will consider  positive  
any lesion  based  on conventional  clinical  imaging  criteria,  in which  case  some  lesions  
considered  positive  may be false positive  and more  importantly  3) our main  emphasis  is to 
evaluate whether  patients  whose  tumor  images  are positive  with 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  
are more  likely  to have  a response  to the antibody  based  drug conjugate  used  under  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#:12 -178 A(3)  
Amended:  09/02/15  Page  27 of 36  
 protocol  11-016. Thus,  we do not want to discard  this agent  if we can use it as a 
theranostic  (defined as  an agent  that is integrated  into the drug development  process  so 
as to guide  patient  selection  and drug development)  for the development  of the antibody  
base  drug conjugate  being  used  under  protocol  11-016. Nonethe  less, we intend  to 
evaluate   treatment  response  of all available  lesions  in this way we will maximize  our 
ability  to determine  the relationship  between  uptake  of antibody  and response.  
 
If, for any patient,  there  is evidence  of an “antigen  sink” based  on rapid  clearance  < 50 h or Vd>3  
times  plasma  volume,  we will consider  a patient  antibody -imaging -positive  if 20% or more  of the 
active  lesions  are visualized.  The presence  of an “antigen  sink” may  bind a significant  amount  of 
antibody  and make  less available  for binding  to tumor.  
 
Antibody  imaging  will be considered  feasible  if 75% of the patients  are antibody -imaging -positive  
as defined  above..We  will enroll  6 patients  (cohort  1A) at the 10mg  dose  level for an initial  decision  
on feasibility.  If 4 or more  of these  patients  have  20% or  more  of their active  lesions  detectable    
by 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  then we will consider the agent  feasible  for imaging,                  
otherwise  we will proceed  to cohort  1B. If the true feasibility  rate is 40%,  this rule will affords  more  
than 82% chance  that cohort  1B will be opened  for enrollment;  this probability is less than 17% if 
the true feasibility  is 75%.  We will also require  that none  of these  patients  experience  dose  severe  
toxicity  attributable  to the initial  10 mg  dose  before  cohort  1B is opened  for enrollment.  
 
If severe  adverse  effect  (grade  3 or 4 CTCAE)  is observed  in any cohort  we will review  with 
MSKCC -DSMC  and IRB before  continuing  with accrual.  If  3 patients  in cohort  1A do no not show  
acceptable  imaging,  as described  above,  we will proceed  to cohort  1B. 
 
In cohort  1B, 6 more  patients  will be enrolled  at a higher dose  (20mg)  for safety  and 
pharmacokinetic  evaluation.   Serial  blood  draws  will be used  to estimate  the pharmacokinetic  
profile of the 10 and 20mg  89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  in this  patient  population.  Pharmacokinetic  
analysis  will be performed  using  a non-compartmental  analysis;  standard  parameters  such  as 
AUC,  clearance,  volume of  distribution,  and Co will be reported.  Descriptive  statistics  will be 
tabulated.  If 3 patients  in Cohort  1B have  antibody negative  imaging  accrual   will stop.  If 4 
patients  in cohort  1B have  positive  imaging  we will move  to cohort   2 using  the best imaging  dose  
from cohort  IA or 1B..  
 
Based  on pharmacokinetic  analysis  from cohorts  1A and 1B an optimal  time point  (based  visually  
on optimal  image  quality  for tumor detection  and clinically/logistically  feasible)  will be determined  
for imaging  and cohort  2 will enroll  up to 15 patients  at the dose  also determined  from cohorts  1A 
or 1B. These  patients  will undergo  a single  whole -body  scan  at the optimal  time point.  The ability  
of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  to detect  tumors  will be estimated  from this cohort using  the proportion  
of antibody -imaging -positive  patients (within  +/-22% if the true detection  rate is 75%).  
 
This study  does  not intend  to find the maximal  tolerated  dose  of DFO-MSTP2109A.  This is a 
diagnostic  agent  that is expected  to have  low incidence  of adverse  events.   Patients  will be 
monitored  closely  looking  for evidence  of adverse  events.   Because  patients  will likely  start new 
therapies  within  2 weeks  of receiving   89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A   only short  term toxicity  will be 
evaluated.  The safety  and tolerability  of 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  will be assessed  using  the 
following  primary  safety  outcome  measures:  Incidence  and nature  of incidence,  nature,  and 
severity  of adverse  events;  and change  in vital signs  and clinical  laboratory  results.  Incidence  and

 severity  of adverse  events  will be summarized  with descriptive  statistics.  
 
Dosimetry:  SUVmax/mean  (that can easily be converted  to %ID/g)  in normal  organs  of patients  
from Cohort  1A and Cohort 1B  will be determined  and this data over time will be used  to 
determine  the residence  time in each  visualized  organ  (liver,  spleen,  kidney  and lung),  other  
organ  will be evaluated  if clinically  appropriate.  The median  residence  time value  will be used  in 
OLINDA  software  to calculate  the dosimetry.  
 
14.3 Secondary  objectives  
 
One of our secondary  exploratory  objectives  is to estimate  the uptake  in tumors.  We will present  
lesion -based  summary  statistics  for the uptake  adjusted  for clustering.  Another  secondary  
objective is  to correlate  89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  imaging  to response  to treatment  in those  patients  
recruited  to protocol  11-016 DSTP3086S  ADC.   Outcome  measures  to be correlated  include  
those  that are outlined  in the parent  protocol  11-016 and include  PSA response,  RECIST  
response,  presence  or absence  of new bone  scan  lesion  and progression  free survival.  We will 
use Kaplan -Meier  estimates  and 95% confidence  intervals  to correlate  these  outcomes  with 
imaging  response.

15.3 Randomization  
 
This research  study  does  not require  randomization  procedures.  
 
16.1 DATA  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
A Research  Study  Assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to the study.  The responsibilities  of the RSA 
include  project  compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory  
monitoring,  problem  resolution  and prioritization,  and coordinate  the activities  of the protocol  study  
team.  
 
The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  database.  Source  documentation  
will be available  to support  the computerized  patient  record.  
Study  personnel  will record  clinical  data in each  patient’s  source  documents  (i.e., the  patient’s  
medical  record).  
MEMORIAL  SLOAN -KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER  
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#:12 -178 A(3)  
Amended:  09/02/15  Page  29 of 36  
 The investigator  will maintain  adequate  and accurate  records  to enable  the conduct  of the study  
to be fully documented  and the study  data to be subsequently  verified.  After study  closure,  the 
investigator will maintain  all source  documents,  study -related  docu ments,  and the data stored  in 
the database  used  for data collection.  Records  will be retained  and securely  stored  for a minimum  
of 2 years  after the completion  of all study  activities.  
 
Data  will be entered  throughout  the duration  of the trial as patients  are enrolled.  Accrual  is 
expected  to last 2 years.  
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Regularly  scheduled  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor patient  accruals  and 
the completeness  of registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to 
assess  missing  data and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and the extent  and accuracy  of 
evaluations  and follow -up will be monitored  periodically  throughout  the study period,  and 
potential  problems  will be brought  to the attention  of the principal  investigator  for 
discussion  and action.  
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by the 
study  team  at least once  a year,  more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The data and safety  monitoring  (DSM)  plans  at MSKCC  were  approved  by the National  
Cancer Institute  in September 2001.  The plans  address  the policies  set forth by the NCI in 
the document  entitled  Policy  of the National  Cancer Institute  for Data  and Safety  
Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials , which  can be found  at  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/clinicaltrials . The DSM  plans  at MSKCC  were  established  
and are monitored  by the Office  of Clinical  Research.  The MSKCC  DSM  plans  can be 
found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at: http://mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/html/70775.cfm . 
 
There  are severa l different  mechanisms  by which  clinical  trials are monitored  for data,  
safety,  and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  
protocol  monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and 
staff education  on clinical  research  quality  assurance)  and departmental  procedures  for 
quality  control,  and there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for 
monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials programs.  The committees:  Data  and Safety  
Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  
Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  report  to the MSKCC  Research  
Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for 
its level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH 
sponsored,  in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be 
addressed,  and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  
activation.  
 
For this  protocol,  we will use the following  patient  safety  monitoring  plan and monitoring   
for adverse  events,  in terms  of the test performed  and their timing  relative  to injection  (see 
Table  1 and 2).  Patient  will be observed  closely  during  infusion  and serial  vital signs  will 
be monitored  every  half hour for at least  2 h or later if the patient  remains  in the 
department.  Patients  will be queried  for adverse  events  up to 6-8 days after infusion.  
 
Safety  reviews  will be performed  by the MSKCC -DSMC  with yearly review  by the IRB.

17.1 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
This study  will be conducted  in compliance  with the protocol,  GCP  guidelines  established  by the 
International  Conference  on Harmonization,  and the ethical  standards  set forth in the Declaration  of 
Helsinki  2004  (available  at: www.laakariliitto.fi/e/ethics/helsinki.html ). 
 
A limited  waiver  of authorization  will be utilized  to effectively  screen  and track  patients  in screening,  
however  the recruitment  process  outlined  presents  no more  than minimal  risk to the privacy  of the 
patients  who are screened  and minimal  protected  health  information  (PHI)  will be maintained  as part  
of a screening  log. 
 
This protocol  does  not have  therapeutic  intent  and does  not offer patients  therapeutic  benefit.  This 
will be clearly  conveyed  to patients  when  communicating  the potential  toxicities/side  effects  of 
participating  in this trial. Participation  in the trial is voluntary  and there  will be no financial  benefit  (or 
burden)  for the patients.  Participants  will not be charged  for 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  PET scans,  
whole  body  probe  counts,  radiotracer  drugs,  extra  blood  draws  (to measure  radiotracer activity),  and 
optional  biopsies.  
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by the Principal  
Investigator and  approved  by the IRB and Privacy  Board  (IRB/PB).  
 
17.3 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
 
Any SAE must  be reported  to the IRB/PB  as soon  as possible  but no later than  5 calendar

 The PI’s signature  and the date it was signed  are required  on the completed  report.  
 
For IND/IDE  protocols:  
The CRDB  AE report  should  be completed  as above  and the FDA assigned  IND/IDE  number  
written  at the top of the report.  If appropriate,  the report  will be forwarded  to the FDA by the 
SAE staff through  the IND Office.  
 
17.2.1  
 
SAE Reporting  To Genentech:  
 
All written  IND Safety  Reports  submitted  to the FDA by the Investigator  must  also be 
faxed  to Genentech  Drug  Safety:  
• Serious  AE reports  that are related  to the 89Zr-MSTP2109A  will be transmitted  to Genentech  within  
fifteen  (15) calendar  days  of the Awareness  Date.  
• Serious  AE reports  that are unrelated  to the 89Zr-MSTP2109A  will be transmitted  to Genentech  
within  thirty  (30) calendar  days  of the Awareness  Date.  
 
Investigators  must  report  all SAEs  to Genentech  within  the timelines  described  above.  The completed  
MedWatch/case  report  should  be faxed  immediately  upon  completion  to Genentech  Drug  Safety  at: 
 
(650)  225-4682  
OR 
(650)  225-5288  
 
 
17.4 SAE Recording  and Grading  
 
17.3.1  Recording  
 
The investigator must  assess  each  event  to determine  if it meets  the criteria for 
classification  as a serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  or serious  adverse  drug reaction  (ADR).  
An SAE/ADR  as defined  in the Code  of Federal  Regulations  (21CFR312.32)  is any event  
that: 
 
• Results  in death  
• Is life-threatening  
• Results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongs  an existing  hospitalization  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity  
• Results  in congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Is medically  significant  in the opinion  of the investigator  
 
All SAEs  that occur any  time a patient  is on study  (i.e., as soon  as the informed  consent  
has been  signed)  or within  30 days of the 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  scan  must  be reported,  
regardless  of the suspected  relationship  to 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A.  Any SAE occurring  
more  than 30 days after the  89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  scan  must  be reported  if a causal  
relationship to 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A is  suspected.  
 
Because  the subjects  enrolled  in this clinical  investigation  will be exclusively  patients  with 
advanced  prostate  cancer,  these  patients  will typically  have  received  extensive  medical  
care before  and at the time of enrollment  in the study.  Such  medical  care includes  
extensive  diagnostic  radiological  studies,  such  as x-rays,  CT scans,  and nuclear   
medicine  studies  (e.g.,  bone  scans)  and, in at least some  cases,  external  beam radiation  
therapy,  brachytherapy,  or both.  The additional  radiation  doses  associated  with the 89Zr-

 DFO -MSTP2109A  study  will typically  represent  a small  increment  in their “lifetime”  
exposures,  given  the number of clinical  studies  (CT, bone  scan,  FDG  scan)  and that 
many  of these  patients  will have  had primary  radiation  to their prostate  or external  beam  
radiation  to bone.  
 
When  accounting  for many  tests  per year,  the radiation  doses  (on the order  of 10 rem) lie 
well within  the “low-dose”  range —well below  the threshold  doses  (typically  on the order of 
100 rem or greater)  for any known  deterministic  effects.  A detailed  description  of the 
expected dosimetry  from the 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A  is included  (Table 3).  The dose  of 
89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A per administration  (~5mCi)  gives  the lowest  amount  that would  be 
consistent  with the research  goal,  namely,  biodistribution,  metabolism,  and 
pharmacokinetics  of the compound.  
 
17.3.2  Grading  Severity  
 
All adverse  events  will be graded  for intensity  on a scale  of 0 to 5. Severity grades  will be 
recorded  and based  on the  CTCAE  v4.0.  
 
17.3.3  Attributing  Causality  
 
The investigator  will evaluate  the potential  relationship  between  all clinical  AEs,  abnormal  
laboratory  values,  and the 89Zr-DFO -MSTP2109A,  and categorize  the relationship  
according  to the descriptions  in Table  5. Abnormal  laboratory  values  of clinical  
significance  that were  present  at baseline  and did not change  in either severity  or 
frequency  during  the experimental  therapy  or intervention  and/or that  can obviously be 
attributed  to the underlying  disease  will be evaluated  by the investigator and recorded  in 
the “unrelated”  category.

Probable  AE is  likely  related  to the 89Zr-DFO - 
MSTP2109A  
Definite  AE is  clearly  related  to the 89Zr-DFO -

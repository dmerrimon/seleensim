infinity, calculated using the terminal elimination rate constant.  
• AUC
0-t/AUC 0-inf: Ratio of AUC 0-t to AUC 0-inf. 
• Cmax: Maximum observed concentration. 
• Tmax: Sampling time at which C max occurs. Where the 
maximum value occurs at more than one time point, T max 
will be the first time point with this value.  
• Kel: Apparen t first order terminal elimination rate constant 
calculated by linear least square regression analysis using the maximum number of points in the terminal log -linear 
phase.  
• t
½: Apparent first order terminal elimination half -life. 
• Cl: Plasma clearance.  
• Vss: Total volume of distribution. 
Primary Endpoints  • AEs.  
• FLU -IGIV PK parameters.

 Secondary Endpoints  The secondary endpoint is an  outcome based on the ordinal 
scale at Day 8 that has 6 mutually exclusive categories:  
• Death;  
• Hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU);  
• Non-ICU hospitalization, requiring supplemental oxygen;  
• Non-ICU hospitalization, not requiring supplemental 
oxygen;  
• No longer hospitalized, but unable to resume normal 
activities; or  
• No longer hospitalized with full resumption of normal activities.  
Exploratory 
Endpoints  The exploratory endpoints are:  
• Ordinal scale assessment at Day 4 (72 hours post dose). 
• Change from baseline to Day 4 in NEW score. 
• Number of days hospitalized. 
• Pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment of the relationship between PK and viral load. 
Safety Parameters  AEs related to the study treatment , lab results and concomitant 
medications will be c ollected throughout the study.

 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
1.1 Trial Drug  
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  is an innovative biopharmaceutical company with a long 
history of developing, manufacturing and marketing a variety of fractionated plasma products 
for international markets. The Sponsor will refer to Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc. throughout this protocol.  
The Sponsor is developing an Anti- Influenza Immunoglobulin Intravenous (FLU- IGIV) 
human product for the treatment of serious influenza infection in hospitalized patients. The 
FLU -IGIV product will be manufactured using the same hyperimmune manufactu ring 
platform process as the FDA and Health Canada licensed products: CNJ -016
® [Vaccinia 
Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human), VIGIV], ANTHRASIL® [Anthrax Immune 
Globulin Intravenous (Human), AIGIV], WinRho® SDF [Rho(D) Immune Globulin 
Intravenous (Human)], HepaGam B® [Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human) Injection], and 
VARIZIG® [Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)]†. 
Proprietary Name: To be determined (TBD)  
Proper / Common Name: Anti- Influenza Immunog lobulin Intravenous (Human) 
Abbreviated Name: FLU -IGIV  
Code Name: NP -025 
Anti-Influenza Immunog lobulin Intravenous will be formulated in multiple  single -use vial(s) 
as a ster ile liquid stabilized with 10% maltose and 0.03% polysorbate 80 (pH between 5.0 
and 6.5) and free of any preservatives. 
Anti-Influenza Immunoglobulin is produced from source plasma collected from Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) licensed plasma collection establishments in the United States 
(US) and Health Canada/US FDA licensed plasma collection establishments in Canada from 
healthy donors who have recovered from influenza (convalescent) and/or were vaccinated 
against seasonal influenza strains. The plasma contains a relatively high concentration of antibodies directed against seasonal influenza strains, specifically influenza A strains H1N1 
and H3N2. Influenza antibodies have been correlated with vaccine efficacy and the passive

 transfer of anti -influenza antibodies are effective in animal models of severe influenza ( 2), 
(4), (5), (6). Clinical proof of concept from treatment with convalescent plasma and purified 
intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV) suggest that FLU- IGIV can raise antibodies levels and 
impact the course of serious illne ss caused by influenza A  (7), (8), (9).  
FLU -IGIV is a purified immun oglobulin preparation containing antibodies to seasonal 
influenza A virus strains. It is a glycoprotein of 150–160 kilodaltons. 
FLU -IGIV will be used in conjunction with SOC, including supportive measures, ventilator 
and fluid management and the prevention and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia, 
which will be captured in the case report form (CRF). Based on current CDC guidance on 
Treatment Considerations for Patients Hospitalized with S uspected or Confirmed influenza  
(or equivalent) ( 1), (2) it is recommended that SOC include a minimum 5 day course of 
oseltamivir (75  mg/twice a day). All antiviral treatments post-symptom development and 
during the study will be recorded in the C RF. 
Immun oglobulin G molecules are glycoproteins composed of one or more units, each 
containing four polypeptide chains: two identical heavy chains (H) and two identical light chains (L). The amino terminal ends of each polypeptide show considerable variation in 
amino acid composition and are referred to as the variable (V) regions to distinguish them from the relatively constant (C) regions. The L chain consists of one variable domain V
L and 
one constant domain C L. The H chain consists of a variable domain V H, and three constant 
domains (CH 1, CH 2, and CH 3). The number of amino acids, along with the molecular weight 
of each heavy chain is approximately twice that of each light chain.  
Influenza therapies target prevention and treatment of influenza illness. Currently, seasonal influenza vaccines against circulating viral strains are available for active immunization to influenza A and B. In addition, antiviral therapies, including neuraminidase inhibitors, can 
prevent and treat acute uncomplicated influenza by  inhibiting viral replication. Yet seasonal 
influenza remains a significant annual disease burden in the United States and worldwide. 
The current vaccines and therapeutics have not proven to be adequate to prevent serious 
influenza illness, including the significant number of annual medical visits, hospitalizations 
and deaths attributed to influenza ( 10). While vaccination reduces influenza incidence and 
severity, vaccine effectiveness is dependent on vaccine coverage, individual response rates 
and the match between the vaccine and circulating influenza strains. While neuraminidase 
inhibitors are potent at inhibiting virus replication, they have limited effectiveness when used beyond 48 hours after infection and antiviral resistant strains have emerged ( 11). Currently 
there are no approved therapies for serious influenza in hospitalized patients, creating an unmet need to treat and improve outcomes in this population. The use of convalescent plasma and fractionated immun oglobulins has been suggested as a complementary strategy to 
treat influ enza virus infection, modify the outcomes of severe disease and provide additional 
benefit to the standard of care ( 12), (13 ). 
The safety profile for immun oglobulin products is well-established in the clinic. 
Immun oglobulins are normal constituents of the human body fluid, and they are used at 
physiological levels without creating pharmacologic/toxicologic active metabolites ( 14). The 
Protocol Number IA -001

 planned clinical doses for FLU- IGIV fall into the range  of doses used for VIGIV and 
ANTHRASIL, and are expected to have a similar safety and pharmacokinetic profile.  
1.2 Clinical Trial Rationale  
There is an unmet medical need for the treatment of serious influenza in hospitalized 
patients. While neuraminidase inhi bitors are utilized as part of the standard of care in 
hospitalized influenza they are most effective when used within 48 hours of symptoms ( 15), 
however, they are not approved for use in this indication. The Sponsor is developing FLU-IGIV ; an anti -influenza immun oglobulin product from high titer plasma to treat serious 
illness caused by influenza A in hospitalized patients.  
The safety profile for im munoglobulin products is well-established in the clinic. 
Immunoglobulins are normal constituents of the human body fluid, and they are used at 
physiological levels without creating pharmacologic/toxicologic active metabolites ( 14). 
Furthermore, The Sponsor has a long history of developing immunoglobulin -based therapies, 
including the licensed products outlined above. Like other human immunoglobul ins, The 
Sponsor’s hyperimmune products have been studied in several healthy volunteer and patient 
trials; the safety profile is consistent with other immunoglobulin products and the pharmacokinetic profile is similar for each product with a half -life of a pproximately 24 to 28 
days after intravenous administration. Taking these data and the following factors into consideration, a Phase I safety and pharmacokinetic trial in healthy volunteers is not planned for FLU -IGIV. Baseline anti -influenza titers in hea lthy volunteers are expected to complicate 
the pharmacokinetic analysis, or if a threshold of acceptable baseline anti -influenza titers is 
set it would significantly restrict enrolment into a Phase I study. Furthermore, determining the anti -influenza titer s and pharmacokinetic profile in severe patients is expected to be more 
informative and may be predictive of patient outcomes rather than a Phase I study in healthy volunteers. In addition, The Sponsor is currently manufacturing an anti -influenza 
hyperimmu ne for the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) using 
the same standardized and validated hyperimmune manufacturing process and product formulation. The NIAID anti-influenza hyperimmune has been evaluated in a pilot study in influenza patients and is currently being studied in a Phase 3 trial in hospitalized influenza 
patients ( 16, 17, 18).  While a Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetic trial in healthy volunteers 
is not planned for FLU-IGIV, the doses planned for FLU- IGIV are bracketed by licensed 
products VIGIV and ANTHRASIL that were administered in healthy volunteer studies (VA-
003b, AX-001) , and are expected to have a similar safety and pharmacokinetic profile.  
The Sponsor’s clinical development plan consists of a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled dose ranging study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and clinical 
bene fit of FLU -IGIV in hospitalized patients with serious illness caused by influenza A 
infection. The primary objective of this study, which initiated in the 2017–2018 flu season, is to determine the optimal dose of FLU-IGIV based upon safety and pharmacokine tics in 
hospitalized patients with serious illness caused by laboratory -confirmed influenza A 
infection. The secondary objective is to evaluate the clinical benefit of FLU- IGIV in the 
same population, and to examine exploratory efficacy endpoints to be used in further development. 
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 25 of 62 
 A second study, a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study evaluating the 
efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of FLU -IGIV in hospitalized patients with serious 
influenza A infecti on is also planned. The primary objective of this study, which will be 
initiated following completion of the Phase 2 study, will be  to evaluate the efficacy and 
clinical benefit of FLU -IGIV use in hospitalized patients with serious illness caused by 
laboratory-confirmed influenza A inf ection.  
In the clinical trials, the eligible serious hospitalized population will be defined by in -patient 
or intensive care unit status and the severity of illness using the National Early Warning 
(NEW) score  (19), as discussed further in section 6.7.9 Nat ional Early Warning (NEW) 
Score below. The NEW score will capture key symptoms and signs of respiratory tract infection including oxygen saturation, requirement for supplemental oxygen, respiration rate, as well as body temperature, blood pressure, and level of consciousness. The serious 
hospitalized population will include patients with risk factors for influenza and influenza-
related complications.  The ordinal scale will be used to evaluate the clinical status of patients  
based on activity levels, hospitalization status and requirements. 
2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
2.1 Hypothesis 
This protocol will allow for the safe use of FLU- IGIV in hospitalized patients with serious 
illness caused b y laboratory-confirmed influenza A infection.  
2.2 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to determine the optimal dose of FLU -IGIV based upon evaluation 
of safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) in hospitalized patients with serious illness caused by  
laboratory-confirmed influenza A infection. 2.3 Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective is to evaluate the clinical benefit of FLU -IGIV in hospitalized 
patients with serious illness caused by laboratory-confirmed influenza A infection. 
3 TRIAL DESIGN 
3.1 Trial Design  
This trial is designed as a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 3 arm 
study. For participants in all three assigned treatment groups, the randomized treatment will 
be administered in addition to Standard of Care (SOC) including antivira l treatment (see 
section 4.1.1).  
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 26 of 62 
 3.2 Anticipated Centers  
This is a multi- center trial utilizing up to 60 clinical trial sites  globally. 
3.3 Sample Size  
The sample size will be 75 hospitalized patients with serious illness caused by laboratory -
confirmed influenza A infection. While no formal sample size calculation was performed, 75 
patients are adequate for determination of optimal dose based on AE and PK da ta, with 
consideration of other safety data and clinical benefit data.  Sample size was not inflated to 
compensate for losses to follow-up.  
3.4 Randomization 
Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 into the study in a double-blind fashion to receive (in 
addition to antiviral SOC)  either a low dose (5 vials) FLU-IGIV or high dose (10 vials) FLU-
IGIV or placebo. 
Randomization schedule generation and logistics will be handled by a DM vendor. A dummy 
randomization schedule will be created by the vendor and approved by Th e Sponsor. 
Subsequently, the production unblinded randomization schedule, differing only in random number-generating seed value, will be generated by the vendor and uploaded to the IXRS system for patient assignments. The randomization schedule will be stored electronically by the IXRS system on a protected server inaccessible to blinded study team members.  
Randomization will not be stratified, except by site.  
3.5 Blinding  
The local site pharmacist will be unblinded in order to access the randomization assignment and prepare the study medication. There will be designated unblinded monitors, and an 
unblinded medical monitor. Other personnel involved in conduct of the study will remain 
blinded through database lock. There will be blinding covers for the IV bags as described in section 5.4 Preparation . 
EDC data will be blinded using role-based permissions. Randomization group and study medication dispensing data will be integrated with the clinical database prior to database lock, but unblinding data will be removed from blinded data extracts by the DM vendor until 
after database lock to ensure maintenance of the blind. Study medication dosing data will be 
reconciled with the randomized treatment group for each patient by the unblinded monitor, and any deviations will be reported in the C linical S tudy R eport. The trial will be unblinded 
once the clinical database is locked.  
While this is a double-blind trial, the blind may be broken if a patient’s health or safety is at risk and knowledge of the study arm may be beneficial to the medical management of the 
patient. In the event that unblinding is required, the IXRS will be contacted or the pharmacist 
or other authorized individual may disclose the patient’s treatment group allocation to the 
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 27 of 62 
 Investigator or treating health care provider. In such an event, The  Sponsor must be notified, 
and appropriate documentation completed. 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will provide another layer of patient safety 
assurance. The DSMB conduct ed a data review meeting following enrollment and data entry 
for the first  20 patients, and will conduct yearly reviews, as applicable . They will have access 
to unblinded data including at least demographics, medical history, study medication (FLU-IGIV or placebo) dosing, AEs and SAEs. The DSMB may make a nonbinding 
recommendati on that The Sponsor stop the study based on pre-specified stopping rules or 
based on their clinical judgment of patient safety (Further details will be outlined in the  
DSMB Charter).

Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 28 of 62 
 Treatment Considerations for Patients Hospitaliz ed with Suspected or Confirmed influenza 
(or equivalent) ( 1), (2), it is recommended that SOC include a minimum 5 day course o f 
oseltamivir (75  mg/twice a day). All antiviral treatments post-symptom development and 
during the study will be recorded in the CRF. This also applies to the assigned placebo study 
treatment group.  
It is up to the treating physician to follow SOC measure s based upon their professional 
medical opinion. However, if patients hospitalized with serious illness caused by influenza A do not receive the antiviral SOC oseltamivir, they will not be eligible for our study.  
4.2 Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Patient s who ha ve any of the exclusion criteria at screening and/or baseline will be excluded 
from participation in this study.  
• Use of any investigational product within the past 30 days prior to screening.

 participation potentially unsafe for the patient or would compromise interpretation of flu 
sympt om improvement. 
4.2.1 Subject Withdrawal  
The subjects must be available, without coercion, for all required parts of the trial, including the follow-up visits post- discharge. 
At any point in the study, if continued participation jeopardizes the subject’s health, the subject should be withdrawn from the trial.  The investigator is encouraged to consult The 
Sponsor prior to the withdrawal of any subject, except in the event of a medical emergency.  
The reason for withdrawal of any subject must be clearly documented on the trial source documents and the appropriate Case Report Form (CRF). 
4.2.2 Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation in this trial at any time, for any reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is 
otherwise entitled.   
In addition, subjects may be withdrawn from the t rial for any of, but not limited to, the 
following reasons: 
• The subject develops a concurrent illness that prevents completion of the trial.  
• The subject develops severe or serious adverse events.   
• It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that it is unwise for the subject to continue in the study. 
• The subject is not compliant with the requirements of the trial to the satisfaction of 
the investigator and/or sponsor (e.g. non-cooperative, misses appointments, 
unreported use of concomitant medications). 
• The subject is lost to follow -up. 
• The subject does not meet the entry criteria for the trial but was erroneously entered into the trial.  
• If an anaphylactic reaction occurs during infusion, the infusion should be stopped immediately.  
• If any complication arises that requires stopping the infusion, e.g. myocardial infarction. 
• If a subject is withdrawn from the trial, they will not be re -entered into the trial for 
any reason.  
Subjects withdrawn from the trial with AEs will still require follow -up until the AE(s ) are 
resolved.

 4.2.3 Subject Replacement  
Subjects withdrawn from the trial or who withdraw consent prior to randomization will be 
replaced.  Subjects withdrawn from the trial or who withdraw consent after randomization 
will not be replaced.  
4.2.4 Follow- up for Withdr awn Subjects  
Every attempt will be made to ensure that subjects who are withdrawn, or who withdraw 
from the trial during the active treatment or follow -up period, will complete all safety 
assessments for the early withdrawal visit as outlined in this proto col.  The investigator 
should inform the subjects that these assessments are for their own safety. 
5 TRIAL MEDICATION 
5.1 Packaging and Formulation 
FLU -IGIV  is supplied in 50 mL Type 1 glass vials sealed with 20 mm siliconized 
bromobutyl rubber stoppers, aluminum seals, and plastic flip- off caps. The extractable

• Pre-infusion PK sample collection: serum sample for pre-infusion HAI and MN 
analysis.  
6.3 Randomization 
Randomization occurs as soon as possible (within 48 hours) after screening and Day 1 
Baseline Pre-Infusion assessments are complete. Randomization should be performed as 
close as possible to the time of infusion. Study treatment administration w as staggered by 3 
days (72 hours) between patients for the first 9 patients.  
6.4 Study Treatment Administration (Day 1) 
The study treatment is to be administered  for the first 30 minutes under the direct supervision 
of the investigator or a qualified sub-investigator or designate. Under no circumstances will 
the investigator allow FLU -IGIV  to be used other than as specified in the protocol. For full 
details on FLU-IGIV preparation, storage, and administration refer to the Investigator ’s 
Brochure.  
Patients will be assigned into one of the three arms based on their randomization to study 
treatment  as follows: 
Arm 1: 5 vials ( 225 mL diluted to 500 mL with saline ) FLU -IGIV;  
Arm 2: 10 vials (450 mL diluted to 500 mL with saline ) FLU -IGIV; or  
Arm 3: Placebo: 500 mL normal saline. 
Taking into consideration the maximum protein concentration (refer to IB),  the high dose 
group would receive a maximum IgG protein dose of 31.5 g.  Assuming a patient weight range of 60 kg to 100 kg, patients will receive approximately 0.32 – 0.53 g/kg of IgG protein 
for the high dose and approximately 0.16 – 0.26 g/kg for the low dose, in a single infusion. 
For participants in all three assigned treatment groups, the randomized treatment will be administered in addition to SOC as defined above in section 4.1.1 Required Standard of Care 
(SOC). Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either a low dose (5 
vials) FLU -IGIV or high dose (10 vials) FLU-IGIV or placebo. 
Both FLU -IGIV doses must be diluted with saline solution to a final volume of 500 mL to 
match the placebo volume administered in order to maintain blinding.  
All IV bags  must be covered with a sleeve to maintain blinding .  
FLU -IGIV  and placebo will be administered by intravenous infusion as follows: 
• Starting infusion rate of 1.0 mL/min for first 30 minutes .  
• Incremental infusion rate if tolerated (every 15-30 minutes) of 1.0 mL/min .  
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 35 of 62 
 • Maximum Infusion Rate of 4.0 mL/min.  
• The duration of infusion for 500 mL will be approximately 3 hours.  
A lower maximum infusion rate of 2 mL/min should be used for patients with increased risk 
of acute renal dysfunction or thrombotic events, based on investigator’s medical opinion with 
careful consideration of lab results. If there is a tolerance issue during infusion, the rate can be scaled back.  
If adverse events occur, such as flushing, headache, nausea, changes in pulse rate or bl ood 
pressure, the rate of infusion should be slowed or temporarily stopped. When events resolve, the infusion rate may be resumed at a rate that is comfortable to the subject (start at half of 
the last tolerated rate and increase gradually).  Refer to the I B (section 3.4.3 Administration) 
for more information.  
6.5 Day 1 ( Post-Infusion  of Study Treatment ) 
After administration of the study treatment , the following assessments must occur (within 4 
hours from when the infusion is complete).  
• Vital signs (including flu symptoms).  
• Adverse events  (AEs) & unanticipated problems.

6.7 Trial Assessment  Details  
The investigator should attempt to perform trial assessments, or if delegated, should ensure 
that the individual performing the task is qualified by education, training, and experience. 
Licensing requirement s may vary by jurisdiction . Investigators should take such 
qualifications/licensing requirements into account when considering delegation of specific 
trial assessment  tasks. In all cases, as a  qualified physician , the Investigator should be 
responsible for all trial- related medical decisions and care.  
6.7.1 Informed Consent  
Details of informed consent  are discussed in section  10.2 Informed Consent . 
6.7.2 Eligibility  
Eligibility will be assessed at screening by ensuring that the subject meets all inclusion 
criteria while not meeting any exclusion criteria ( 4.1 Subject Inclusion Criteria  and 4.2 
Subject Exclusion Criteria ). In order for the subject eligibility to be determined, a ll screening 
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 40 of 62 
 assessments must be completed  with the exception of those for PK/central lab that do not 
occur at the clinical trial site.  
6.7.3 Demo graphy 
Demographic information will be obtained for each subject at screening and will include age/ 
date of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity . 
6.7.4 Medical History  
Medical history  will be collected at screening  and updated at Day 1 (Baseline) . Collect if the 
subject has received the seasonal influenza vaccine for the present season.  Ensure any 
medical history collected doesn’t affect the eligibility of the subject.  
6.7.5 Hospital Admission Status  
The hospital admission status (residing unit: general/ICU/other)  will be obtained at baseline 
and throughout the study .  
6.7.6 Physical Exam 
A physical exam (including but not limited to eyes , ears, nose, throat, lymph nodes, heart, 
pulse, lungs, and abdomen assessments), will be performed throughout the study and the patien t’s height, weight and body mass index (BMI) will be collected at screening .  
6.7.7 Vital Signs/Flu Symptoms  
Vital signs will be collected for subject including temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse and solicitation of  flu symptoms  (fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy 
nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, vomiting or diarrhea). If a patient has 
required c hest x -rays or other diagnostic methods during their hospitalization  to determine 
the extent of infection in the respiratory trac t (pneumonia) , the available images  should be 
redacted  and the assessment d etails  should be collected and input into the CRF for that 
subject at the next study visit. If a site is not able to provide redacted image files, clearly 
enter detailed assessment information (from the radiologist report) into the eCRF. At screening, baseline oxygen saturation on room air will be collected.  
6.7.8 Ordinal Scale  
The ordinal scale will be used  to assess clinical improvement, which categorizes patients into 
one of six mutually- exclusive categories  based on activity levels, hospitalization status and 
requirements as follows: 
• Death;  
• Hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU);  
• Non-ICU hospitalization, requiring supplemental oxygen;  
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 41 of 62 
 • Non-ICU hospitalization, not requiring supplemental oxygen;  
• No longer hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities; or  
• No longer hospitalized with full resumption of normal activities.  
The H ospital Discharge visit ordinal scale assessment should be one of the two  “No longer 
hospitalized” options. 
6.7.9 National Early Warning  (NEW) Score  
The NEW  score will be collected for patients and will be defined by in -patient or intensive 
care unit status and the severity of illness. The NEW scoring system will capture key 
symptoms and signs of respiratory tract infection including oxygen saturation, requirement for supplemental oxygen, respiration rate, as well as body temperature, blood pressure, and 
level of  consciousness. The NEW score parameters can be obtained from patient hospital 
medical records, nursing notes, etc. and will be recorded in the CRF. Screening NEW score 
can be calculated using values from hospital admission prior to medical intervention, a s 
provided treatment (ex. Acetaminophen) may confound NEW scoring parameters (ex. f ever). 
For more information on NEW score interpretation, please see Appendix I  for the NEW 
Scoring Guide.  
6.7.10 Markers of Viral Infection/Viral Load  Sample Collection

6.8.2.3 Viral Marker/Load Analysis 
The local lab will determine if there is influenza A infection at screening , by a Rapid Ag test 
or PCR, accordi ng to their procedures.  
The central lab will confirm if there is influenza A infection from the screening sample 
before performing any further testing. The central lab will perform viral load analysis by RT -
qPCR and viral culture and additional testing to  identify the strain (ex. H1N1/H3N2) for all 
samples  listed in the schedule of assessments and section 6 Trial Procedures  and confirmed 
as influenza A positive.  
6.9 Concomitant Medications  
The administration of concomitant medications is permitted during the trial period in keeping 
with the standard of care for subjects with serious illness due to influenza A infection.  Any 
medication taken by the subject, including transfusions, herbal preparations and non-
prescription medications within 6 days prior to treatment assignment and/or during the course of the trial and the reason for use will be recorded on the trial source documents and concomitant medications page of the CRF. 
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 44 of 62 
 FLU -IGIV will be used in conjunction with SOC , including supportive measures, ventilat or 
and fluid management and the prevention and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia, 
which will be captured in the CRF . Based on current CDC guidance (or equivalent) on 
Treatment Considerations for Patients Hospitalized with Suspected or Confirmed Influenza (1), (2) it is recommended th at SOC include a minimum 5 day course of oseltamivir (75 
mg/twice a day). All antiviral treatments post-symptom development and during the study will be recorded in the CRF.  This also applies to the assigned placebo study treatment group. 
6.10 Excluded Concomit ant Medications  
There are no known excluded concomitant medications. Re fer the Investigator’s Brochure for 
full details  on potential impaired efficacy for vaccines . 
7 ASSESSMENT OF PK  
7.1 PK Parameters  
From the HAI and MN  assays the following pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated 
using the non-compartmental approach: 
• AUC
0-t: The area under the concentration -time curve  (AUC)  from time 0 to the last 
quantifiable concentration, as calculated by the linear trapezoidal method. 
• AUC 0-day 7: AUC from time 0 to day 7. 
• AUC 0-inf: AUC 0-t plus the additional area extrapolated to infinity, calculated using the 
terminal elimination rate constant.  
• AUC 0-t/AUC 0-inf: Ratio of AUC 0-t to AUC 0-inf. 
• Cmax: Maximum observed concentration. 
• Tmax: Sampling time at which C max occurs. Where the maximum value occurs at more 
than one time point, T max will be the first time point with this value.  
• Kel: Apparent first order terminal elimination rate constant calculated by linear least 
square regressio n analysis using the maximum number of points in the terminal log -linear 
phase.  
• t½: Apparent first order terminal elimination half -life. 
• Cl: Plasma clearance.  
• Vss: Total volume of distribution. 
7.2 Assessment of PK Parameters  
PK will be assessed in all subject s, including those subjects assigned to the placebo group, 
who will have natural antibody production. Due to the buildup of anti-influenza antibodies 
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 45 of 62 
 from subjects’ natural immunity, PK parameters will be estimates only and cannot quantify 
precisely the levels of FLU -IGIV in dosed subjects.  
8 ASSESSMENT OF  SAFETY  
The safety of the trial drug will be assessed by monitoring closely a dverse events  (AE) 
defined as  related to study treatment, lab results for chemistry and hematology and 
concomitant medications co llected throughout the study. Any lab results and concomitant 
medications will be monitored regularly.  
8.1 Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event Definition  
The occurrence of AE s will be monitored throughout all phases of the trial and will cover all 
participating subjects. AE capture will begin after randomization, and any medical history changes that occur after baseline assessments during randomization  and before dosing should 
be updated as medical history. 
Adverse events are to be elicited by the investigator (or designate) by asking the subject non-
leading questions.  The association of the AE to the study treatment is to be judged by the investigator as related or not-related/no relationship. 
8.1.1 Definitions  
An Adverse Event (AE)
:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event (AE) can therefore b e any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
NOTE: A  diagnosis should be preferentially captured as an adverse event term and 
signs and symptoms should be captured only in the absence of a unifying diagnosis.  In the event that there are multiple diagnoses, then all diagnoses should be captured.  
The worsening of an existing sign, symptom or disease is also considered to be an 
AE.  An abnormal laboratory finding deemed by the Principal Investigator as not clinically significant will not be captured as an AE, but an abnormal laboratory 
finding that worsens after dosing with the study drug, from not clinically significant 
to clinically significant, is considered an AE.  Surgical procedures are not AE s.  They 
are the action taken to treat a medical condition.  Interventions that were planned 
prior to study entry for medical conditions that started prior to study entry, but did 
not worsen during the clinical trial are not reported as AEs. 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
:  Any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose: results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 46 of 62 
 Important medical events which may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
NOTE: Death  is an outcome and not an event. The condition leading to death is the 
event. Death will be considered an event only when no other information regarding 
the cause of death is available. 
Hospitalization that is planned before inclusion into the study or out patient treatment 
without overnight hospitalization is not considered a SAE.  Hospitalization that 
occurs during a trial for social reasons (e.g., transportation difficulties, respite care) 
is not considered to be a SAE. 
Adverse Drug Reaction
:  Any noxious and unintended response to a medicinal 
product related to any dose. 
Expected Adverse Drug Reaction/Event :  An adverse reaction, the nature or 
severity of which is consistent with the applicable product information (e.g. 
Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or package 
insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product). 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction/Event :  An adverse reaction, the nature or 
severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g. Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product). 
All adverse events, including those that are not of a serious nature and those that are expected, w ill be documented by the investigators (or designates) in the source 
documents and appropriately transcribed into the CRF.  All adverse events will be 
examined by a physician investigator or sub-investigator for assessment of both 
severity and causality us ing the following criteria:  
8.1.2 Assessment of Severity (Intensity)  
The adverse event severity should be assessed based on the MedDRA Lowest Level Term (LLT) scale below.  
Mild
: awareness of a sign or symptom but subject can tolerate.  
Moderate : discomfort enough to cause interference with normal daily activity.  
Severe : resulting in an inability to do work or do usual daily activity. 
8.1.3 Assessment of Causality (ICH Classification) 
In accordance with ICH E2A and 21.CFR.312, the following definitions are used to assess causality (relatedness) of the adverse events:  
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 47 of 62 
 Related :  There is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the product in 
question. The expression “reasonable possibility” is meant to convey in general that 
there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
Not-related / No relationship :  The AE is clearly or most probably caused by other 
etiology such as the patient’s underlying condition, therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy, or the delay between the administration of the product and the 
onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal relation, or the AE started before the administration of the product. 
8.2 Description of Known AE Profile for FLU -IGIV  
The safety of human IV immunoglobulins is well establishe d.  The incidence of AEs 
associated with administration of IV immunoglobulin  products is reported by the 
manufacturers to be in the range of 1 to 15%, usually less than 5% ( 20, 21 ).  Non -
anaphylactic reactions are most common and the majority of AEs are mild and self -limiting 
in nature. 
A compl ete list of risks with details ar e outlined in the Investigator ’s Brochure which  
includes: 
• Hypersensitivity  
• Renal dysfunction/f ailure  
• Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS)  
• Hemolysis  
• Thrombotic events 
• Transfusion- Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)  
• Infusion rate reactions  
• Interference with blood glucose testing 
8.3 Adverse Event Reporting  
Occurrence of adverse events will be monitored throughout the trial and will cover all 
participating patients , including any randomized subject.  Trial subjects will be provided with 
a 24 hour telephone number to contact trial personnel in case of an untoward reaction after hospital discharge.  
All AEs must be followed to resolution, or up to 60 days after the patient has completed the 
trial, whichever occurs first.  The investigator will follow serious related adverse events to 
resolution, or in the case of disability or incapacity, until the condition has stabilized.  In the event that a patient does not complete the trial, efforts must be made to obtain information regarding all AEs, with a minimum follow -up of 60 days post-dosing. 
If a subject becomes pregnant during a clinical trial, these pregnancies will be considered as SAEs and will be followed until termination of pregnancy or birth.  If a pregnancy results in

 an abnormal outcome that the reporting health care professional considers might be due to 
the trial drug, then the guidelines for expedited reporting of serious, unexpected adverse drug reactions should be followed. 
8.4 Reporting of SAEs 
The investigator will report all serio us adverse events to The Sponsor ’s Pharm acovigilance 
Department  by telephone or e- mail (with the Medical Monitor in copy) within 24 hours of 
the investigator’s knowledge of occurrence.  This will be followed by a fax or e- mail copy of 
the SAE Form , with th e Medical Monitor in copy.  A written SAE report by the investigator 
to The Sponsor (including medical summary of the SAE) must follow within 3 days of the 
investigator’s knowledge of occurrence of the SAE. 
All reports should be made to:

8.5 Safety Data Monitoring  
Study treatment administration w as staggered by 3 days (72 hours) between patients for the 
first 9 patients. An independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will provide on-
going review of safety data during the trial.  The DSMB will be responsible for assessing safety and monitoring overall conduct and integrity of the trial.  In fulfilling these 
responsibilities, the DSMB may make recommendations concerning continuation and/or 
stopping of the trial as it relates to safety and risk to the patient  population as outlined in 
section 9.2.5 Criteria for Early Termination of the Trial. 
9 STATISTICAL ISSUES IN TRIAL DESIGN AND P K ASSESSMENT  
9.1 Sample Size Cal culation  
The sample size will be 75 hospitalized patients with serious illness caused by laboratory-
confirmed influenza A infection. While no formal sample size calculation was performed, 75 
patients are adequate for determination of optimal dose based on AE and PK data, with 
consideration of other safety data and clinical benefit data.  

Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 49 of 62 
 9.1.1 Safety Population  
The safety population will include all patients who receive any amount of study 
medication (FLU -IGIV or placebo).  
9.1.2 PK Population  
The PK population will include all patients who have adequate PK data for analysis  
that includes day 1 pre-infusion/baseline, post-infusion plus at least one additional time point. 
9.1.3 Intent to Treat Population  (ITT)  
The intent to treat population will include all randomized patients  regardless of study 
medication treatment status, influenza type or protocol deviations. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomized. 
9.1.3.1 Modified Intent to Treat Population (mITT)  
The mITT  population will include those patients  from the ITT population who met 
eligibility criteria, received study medication (FLU -IGIV or placebo) and have  
confirmed influenza A by the local lab Rapid Ag or PCR markers of viral infection 
test from the screening NP swab sample. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomized. 
9.1.3.2 Virologically Confirmed Modified Intent to Treat Population (vITT) 
The vITT  population will include any patients  from the mITT population who met 
eligibility criteria, received study medication (FLU -IGIV or placebo) and have 
confirmed influenza A by the central  lab RT -qPCR markers of viral infection test 
from the screening NP swab sample. Patients will be analyzed according to the 
treatment to which they were randomized. 
9.1.4 Clinically Evalua ble Population (CE)  
The CE population will include all patients who met eligibility criteria, received ≥  80% of 
study medication (FLU -IGIV or placebo) infusion matching their randomized treatment 
group, ≥  80% of the oseltamivir and have a non- missing Day 8  ordinal scale assessment.  
9.2 Trial Endpoints  
9.2.1 Primary Endpoint  
Primary endpoint analyses will include AE incidence and severity and PK parameters, upon which optimal dose determination will be based. 
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 50 of 62 
 9.2.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoint is an outcome based on the ordinal scale at Day 8 that has six  
mutually exclusive categories:  
• Death;  
• Hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU);  
• Non-ICU hospitalization, requiring supplemental oxygen;  
• Non-ICU hospitalization, not requiring supplemental oxygen;  
• No longer hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities; or  
• No longer hospitalized with full resumption of normal activities.  
9.2.3 Exploratory Endpoints 
The exploratory endpoints are:  
• Ordinal scale assessment at Day 4 (72 hours post dose). 
• Change from baseline to Day 4 in NEW score. 
• Number of days hospitalized. 
• Pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment of the relationship between PK and viral load. 
9.2.4 Safety Endpoints  
Adverse events related to the study treatment, lab results and concomitant medications will 
be coll ected throughout the study. 
9.2.5 Criteria for Early Termination of the Trial  
The Sponsor and /or the principal investigator may elect to terminate the trial early as defined 
by the clinical trial agreement. Meeting a safety stopping criterion will not automatically 
trigger study termination, but a hold on recruitment will be implemented until an ad hoc DSMB meeting is held. If any of the following criteria are fulfilled, the DSMB will review 
the unblinded safety data to assess the evidence for an excess  of events in the FLU- IGIV 
treatment groups relative to the placebo group. The DSMB will determine whether trial 
termination is recommended, which would require a majority vote. 
• Two or more subjects experience related rare reactions reported for immunoglobulin  
intravenous (human) (IGIV), such as thrombotic events, hemolysis or transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI).  
• Three or more subjects experience the same related SAE (per sponsor assessment).  
• Five or more subjects experience the same related sever e AE.  
• Ten or more subjects experience a related moderate or higher AE associated with the same organ system.  
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 51 of 62 
 • Eight or more patients who were not able to tolerate the entire 500 mL IV infusion, 
but were administered a partial study medication infusion (FLU-IGIV or placebo). 
• Proportion of deaths due to complications from worsened primary conditions or co-
morbidities ≥ 10% higher than that reported for the influenza season by CDC  
FLUVIEW ( https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm ). 
• Any other findings that, at the discretion of the medical monitors, indicate that the study should be halted. 
Administrative issues affecting one or more sites may constitute grounds for stopping the trial at that site(s). Examples include, but are not limited to, non -adherence to the protocol, 
unavailability of the Principal Investigator or staff for The Sponsor ’s (or their authorized 
representative) monitoring personnel, inadequate evidence of the Pri ncipal Investigator’s 
personal conduct or supervision of the trial, relocation of the investigator or reallocation of 
investigator’s responsibilities or disqualification of the investigator by the regulatory 
authority. 
The Sponsor and the site principal in vestigator (s) may elect to terminate the trial early for a 
variety of other reasons. A decision to terminate the trial early may be based on data 
suggesting that the trial treatment (or participation in the trial) may be unsafe; the protocol or conduct of the trial is flawed such that the safety or rights of the trial subjects may be 
adversely affected; the ethics committee withdraws the approval for the trial and denies 
reconsideration; the investigational treatment is found to be ineffective; recruitment is poor; research strategy or management priorities change; or a clinical hold is imposed by a regulatory authority, to name a few.  
Any decision to voluntarily suspend or terminate a clinical trial will be carefully reviewed and fully justified. The Sponsor will notify the regulatory authorities and the Institutional 
Review Board s (IRB)/Ethics Committee s (EC) of any suspension or termination, along with 
justification for restarting or terminating the study as applicable.  
The principal investigator must noti fy the IRB /EC in writing of the trial’s completion or early 
termination. The Sponsor must receive a copy of the notification letter from the IRB /EC 
indicating receipt of the completion or early termination letter.  
9.3 Interim Analyses  
A DSMB data review occurred  in March 2018, after enrollment and data entry for 20 
subjects.  Thereafter, the DSMB  will conduct yearly reviews, as applicable.  
No formal interim analysis is planned.  
9.4 Planned Method of Analyses  
In general, continuous endpoints will be summarized by descriptive statistics including number of patients, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. 
Categorical endpoints will be summarized by the total number of patients, frequencies and 
percentages.  
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24 
 
 
Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 52 of 62 
 AEs will be coded to system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) , using the current version at the time of coding . AEs will 
be defined as events beginning after first study medication administration that were not 
present prior to first  study medication administration or those that were present prior to first 
study medication administration and subsequently worsened in severity. AE incidence for 
each system organ class and preferred term will be summarized for the safety population by 
treatment group overall as well as separately by severity and for events related to study 
medication (FLU -IGIV or placebo). Serious AEs will be summarized separately for the same 
population, as will deaths.  Separate subgroup analyses of AE and SAE incidence s by sex, 
race (Caucasians, African Americans, and others) and age (over 55 versus 18-54) will be 
performed by treatment group. 
PK analysis for anti -influenza antibodies will be conducted for the PK population using HAI 
and MN  analysis. Serum concentration  versus time data will be analyzed by standard 
noncompartmental methods (i.e., trapezoidal method). Actual times and not nominal times 
will be used in the analysis, and concentrations below the limit of quantitation (LOQ) and/or 
detection (LOD) will be imp uted as half of this value. Calculated PK parameters will include 
maximum serum concentration (C max), time of maximum serum concentration (t max), half- life 
(t1/2), area under the concentration- time curve (AUC) for 0 -t (time 0 to the last 
concentration), AUC 0-7 (time 0 to Day 7), AUC 0-inf (time 0 to infinity), ratio of AUC 0-t/AUC 0-
inf, terminal elimination rate constant (K el), clearance (Cl) and volume of distribution (V ss). 
PK parameters will be reported using descriptive statistics by treatment group for the PK population. Dose proportionality will be explored using log-transformed PK data. Serum 
concentration -time data will be plotted by treatment group. Relevant subset analyses may be 
performed.  
Patient disposition, including early termination reasons, wi ll be summarized by treatment 
group for all patients. Major protocol deviations will be presented by treatment group for the safety population. Patient demographics, medical history and study medication (FLU- IGIV 
or placebo) dosing data will be tabulated by treatment group for the safety population. Important baseline values such as ordinal score assessment, NEW score and flu symptoms will be summarized by treatment group for the safety and ITT  populations . Pre-infusion 
medications, concomitant medications and concomitant medical procedures will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary and displayed by treatment group for the safety population. 
Ordinal scale assessment will be analyzed at Days 4 and 8 for the ITT and CE populations 
using a proportional odds model investigating the effect of treatment group on ordinal 
outcome. An odds ratio will be computed for each study treatment group relative to placebo, interpretable as the mean location shift across the ordinal scale attributed to IVIG treatment. 
After verification of the proportional odds assumption for dose, a dose-response relationship 
will be tested using ordinal logistic regression with a cumulative logit link and an ordinal dose variable, adjusting for significant prognostic factors using stepwise selection. If the 
proportional odds assumption is significantly violated, then a partial proportional odds model 
for dose will be explored. Relevant subset analyses may be performed.

Emergent BioSolutions Canada Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 53 of 62 
 Change from baseline to Day 4 in NEW score will be compared between treatmen t groups 
for the ITT and CE populations using nonparametric rank analysis. Viral load data from 
central laboratory NP swabs will be summarized by time point for the ITT and CE 
populations by treatment group and tested for differences between treatment groups at key 
time points (e .g, Days 2 and 3). The relationship between PK and viral load will be 
investigated for patients belonging to both the PK and ITT populations. 
Central clinical laboratory test results will be summarized by time point and treatment group using descriptive statistics for the safety population. Vital signs parameters will be presented in the same manner.

not less than 25 years after completion or termination of the trial.  Archival data may be held 
on microfiche or electronic record, provided that a backup exists and that hard copy can be 
obtained from it if required.  If source documents are to be destroyed as per hospital or local regulatory policy, the investigator is requested to contact The Sponsor. 
Records fro m the trial that identify the subject will be confidential except that they may be 
given to and inspected by The Sponsor of the trial (or designate(s)), the IRB /EC, the Food 
and Drug Administration, other relevant regulatory agencies as appropriate, and wi ll not 
otherwise be released except as required by law.  All information provided to the investigator 
by The Sponsor is to be considered confidential unless otherwise stated. 
11.5 Electronic Data  
The investigator (or designate) will record data collected in this clinical trial on electronic 
CRFs  (eCRFs) .  The electronic forms are to be completed on a contemporaneous basis . 
The data are the property of The Sponsor of the trial.  Questions arising fr om e CRF data will 
be dealt with by the issuance of Data Quer ies within the EDC environment by The Sponsor 
Clinical Data and Statistics (or designate) to the investigator.  
11.6 Monitoring  
Safety will be monitored using a risk -based monitoring approach. At the time the trial is 
initiated, monitors from The Sponsor/CRO will thoroughly review the protocol and data forms with the investigators and their staff. During the trial, the monitors will be available to 
discuss by telephone, e-mail, or in person (during site visits), questions regarding adverse 
reactions, removal of subjects from the trial, conduct of the trial and other clinical trial 
matters. Monitors from The Sponsor /CRO will visit at the initiation of the trial, during the 
trial and at the completion of the trial. At the time of each monitoring visit, the monitors will check the case report forms of the subjects to ensure that all items have been completed, that the data are accurate and obtained in the manner specified in the protocol and that data 
recorded on the data forms for the trial agree wit h medical records at the site. The monitors 
will also check for general protocol and regulatory compliance by subjects and site 
personnel. 
To ensure maintenance of the blind, each clinical site will have two separ ate monitors 
assigned - one for monitoring the blinded portion of the study and the other for verifying the 
Protocol Number IA -001 
Version 5.0 2019 -Jan-24

Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
Those  patients  satisfying  all inclusion and exclusion  criteria  will be randomized to a Treatment 
Group. Amifampridine phosphate (at the  patient’s optimal dose)  or placebo will be dispensed by the 
site pharmacist, according to the randomization schedule, to begin with the next dose after all Day 0 
assessments are completed and continued  for 4 days.  After completion of the study , patients will be 
eligible for expanded access treatment program  with open- label amifampridine phosphate.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Screening  
Patients receiving amifampridine phosphate treatment for LEMS, and meeting the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria are eligible to participate in this study. They can be randomized if on a stable dose 
and frequency of amifampridine phosphate for at least  1 we ek before being randomized.  
Treatment  (Days 1 -4) (+1 day)  
Patients will be randomized (1:1 ratio) on the last day of the screening period (Day  0) to either 
amifampridine phosphate or placebo. Beginning  with the next dose after all Day 0 assessments are 
completed , the patient will take, under double -blind conditions, either amifampridine phosphate 
tablets or placebo tablets through Day 4, with a clinic visit on the last day (Day 4) for assessments 
(Table 3 ). Any unused portion of dispensed drug will be returned.   
 
During all phases of the study, safety and efficacy assessments will be made as detailed in the

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT(S), DOSE, ROUTE, AND REGIMEN:  
The investigational product (IP) is amifampridine phosphate  tablets 10 mg , and it will be provided 
in round, white -scored tablets, containing amifampridine phosphate formulated to be the equivalent 
of 10 mg amifampridine  base per tablet.  The total daily dose will be individually determined by the 
Investigator, within the bounds of a total daily dose of up to 80 mg, divided into dose s taken 3 to 4 
times per day as prescribed by the I nvestigator, based on optimal neuromuscular benefit.  
Amifampridine phosphate  tablets are to  be taken orally by mouth.

The investigational product, and matching placebo, will be provided by Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc., 355 Alhambra Circle, Suite 1250, Coral Gables, Florida, 33134, United States. 
REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE, ROUTE, AND REGIMEN:  
The reference therapy is a p lacebo, provided as tablets indistinguishable from amifampridine tablets. 
The placebo will be administered consistent with the dose and dose regimen of the investigational 
product ( amifampridine phosphate ). 
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION : 
Safety:  
Safety will be assessed by the incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including 
serious adverse events (SAEs) . Vital signs, physical examination, and concomitant medications will 
also be evaluated.  
Efficacy:  
• Primary:  
o To assess the clinical efficacy of amifampridine phosphate compared with placebo 
in individuals  with LEMS,  based on change  of the co -primary endpoints QMG Score 
and Subject Global Improvement (SGI).  
• Secondary:  
o Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI -I) 
• Exploratory:  
o Greater than 2 0% increase  in the a verage time of 3 repetitions for Timed Up and Go 
test (3TUG)  
o Patient rating on change of most bothersome symptom for them. 
 
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
Sample Size Determination  
For Change From Baseline in QMG  Scores, a between -treatment difference of - 3.5 and a standard 
deviation at most 3, a sample size of  24  patients  will provide power of at least 80% for a 0.05 level 
test. Similarly, for Change From Baseline in SGI Scores, a between -treatment difference o f -2.1 and 
a standard deviation at most 2, a sample size of 26 patients will provide power of 80% for a 0.05 
level test.  Thus a total sample size of 26 patients, equally randomized to the two treatments , will 
provide power of at least 80% for each of the t wo co -primary endpoints.  
 
Safety Analysis  
Safety analyses will be conducted on the safety population (i.e. all patients who receive at least 1 
dose of amifampridine or placebo). The safety analysis will be descriptive and will be presented on 
using observe d data only. 
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Only 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 7 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be included in the safety analysis. The incidence of TEAEs 
will be summarized by system organ class, preferred term , relationship to treatment, and severity by 
treatment .  
All other safety measures including vital signs, physical examination, and concomitant medications 
data will also be summarized . 
 
Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analysis will be conducted on 2 datasets:  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): This population consists of all randomized patients who receive at 
least 1 dose of IP (amifampridine or placebo) and have at least one post -treatment efficacy 
assessment.  
• Per Protocol (PP): This population is a subset of the FAS population, excluding patients with 
major protocol deviations. The PP population will include all patients who:  
o Have no major protocol deviations or inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations that 
might potentially affect efficacy, and  
o Patients who took at le ast 80% of the required treatment doses and remained enrolled 
for at least 4 days.  
Evaluations obtained at the time of discontinuation will be included in the analyses. Patients who 
discontinue with no post -randomization data will be excluded from all efficacy analyses but will be 
included in the safety analyses.  
For each efficacy variable with a corresponding assessment at Baseline, Change From Baseline 
(CFB) will be computed as the post -treatment result minus the Baseline result. The post -treatment 
result will be the result obtained on Day 4, unless the patient  discontinued treatment early, in which 
case the post -treatment result may be obtained at an earlier time point.  For statistical test, two -sided 
P values <0.05 will be considered as statistically  significant.  
Summary statistics for QMG score and the corresponding CFB  will be presented by treatment.  The 
analysis of CFB for Total QMG Score is a coprimary efficacy endpoint and an alysis will be 
performed by fitting a fixed  effects linear  model to the  data with CFB as the response. The model 
will include terms for treatment  and QMG at Baseline. A test comparing the least squares (LS) means 
will be conducted to evaluate the treatment effect .  
The raw scores  and CFB for each item of QMG will be summarized by treatment .  Between -treatment 
comparisons with respect to CFB for Right arm outstretched, Left arm outstretched, Right leg 
outstretched, and Left leg outstretched  will be performed using a fixed effects linear model  with 
terms for treatment  and QMG at  Baseline .  
Summary statistics for SGI score and the corresponding CFB  will be presented by treatment. The 
analysis of CFB for SGI is a coprimary efficacy endpoint and analysis will be performed by fitting a 
fixed  effects linear model to the data with CFB as the response.  The model will include terms for 
treatment  and SGI at Baseline. A test comparing the LS means will be conducted to evaluate the 
treatment effect.

6 INTRODUCTION 
A comprehensive review of amifampridine phosphate is contained in the Firdapse® 
Investigator’s Brochure  supplied by Catalyst (February, 2015). Investigators are to review the  
document before initiating this study.  
 
6.1 Disease Background  
Lambert -Eaton Myasthen ic Syndrome (LEMS) is a very rare autoimmune disease with the 
primary  symptom of proximal muscle weakness. Muscle weakness resulting from LEMS is 
caused by auto -antibodies directed against type P/Q voltage -gated calcium channels (VGCCs) 
located on the pre -synaptic member of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)  (Motomura, 1997) . 
Auto -antibodies inhibit the entry of calcium into the nerve, impairing the release of 
acetylcholine from nerve terminals into the synapse, resulting in  a loss of neuromuscular 
transmission (Augustine, 1990; Lambert, 1956; Verschuuren, 2006) . 
Although the true prevalence of LEMS is uncertain, it has been estimated that this disease  
affects approximately 1 – 9 out of 100,000 of the general population (Sanders,  2003) . Available 
literature suggests that approximately 50% to 55% of patients have a paraneoplastic form of 
LEMS, mainly small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (Verschuuren, 2006; Wirtz, 2002a) . In a large 
clinical study that included 50 consecutive patients with LEMS,  SCLC was present in 84% of 
patients with cancer (O'Neill, 1988) . The prevalence of LEMS in patients with SCLC is 
estimated to be  approximately 3% (Payne, 2010) . In approximately 90% of patients with the 
paraneoplastic form of LEMS, a tumor was detected within 2 years following the  diagnosis of 
LEMS  (Verschuuren, 2006; Elias, 2010). 
 
Clinically, LEMS is characterized by proximal muscle weakness usually greater in the hip than 
shoulder girdle muscles, fatigability, muscle aches, and autonomic dysfunction 
(e.g. impotence, dry mouth, constipation) (Lambert, 1956; Verschuuren, 2006) . Other 
symptoms may include paresthesias, diplopia, and orthostatic hypotension (Wirtz, 2002b) . The 
charact eristic proximal muscle weakness can compromise the most basic tasks such as walking 
and climbing stairs. The symptoms of impaired neuromuscular transmission typically present after age of 40, with a peak incidence between 50 and 70 years (Wirtz,  2002b; O'Neill, 1988) . 
The onset of symptoms is  usually  gradual and insidious, taking place over several weeks to 
many months or even years. In rare cases, weakness of the respiratory muscles can lead to a life-threatening respiratory crisis  that necessitates artificial ventilation (O'Neill, 1988; 
Maddison, 1999) . There have also been isolated reports of patients  presenting with acute 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 18 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
respiratory failure as the primary symptom of LEMS  (Verschuuren, 2006; Elias, 2010; 
Vedeler, 2006) . In LEMS, the gradual onset of hip girdle weakness is  typically an early 
symptom with less dramatic shoulder girdle weakness. Clinical features that present later in 
LEMS include muscle  weakness that worsens with prolonged exercise, respiratory muscle 
weakness, diplopia, and dry mouth (Seneviratne, 1999) . 
 
The diagnosis of LEMS is typically based on clinical findings and the presence of antibodies 
to VGCC and electrodiagnostic studies. The VGCC radioimmunoassay detects the ability of patient’s serum to induce immunoglobulin G (IgG) -calcium complex precipitates after 
exposure to solubilized calcium channels. As  discussed above, antibodies against the P/Q -type 
VGCC are present in approximately 85% to 95% of patients with LEMS.  
 
In addition, a  characteristic electrophysiologic pattern associated with LEMS may support  the 
diagnosis of a presynaptic NMJ disorder . The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) 
amplitude in a resting muscle in patients with LEMS is usually significantly reduced . 
Following high frequency (10 -50 Hertz [Hz]) repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS), there is a 
significant increment (> 100%) with a marked increase in the CMAP amplitude 
(Weinberg,  2010) . An increase in the CMAP amplitude > 100% after high frequency 
stimulation or exercise is considered diagnostic of a presynaptic NMJ disorder. In addition, the 
muscle action potentials observed in patients w ith LEMS are often unstable on 
electromyography (EMG) needle examination and the single fiber EMG typically has significant jitter and transmission blocking that is characteristically improved at higher firing rates (Tron telj, 1991; Chaudhry, 1991) . 
 
Management of patients with LEMS can be classified into 3 main categories, each targeting 
different aspects of the pathogenesis of the disease: 1) anti -tumor treatment 
(e.g. chemotherapy , multikinase inhibitors ) in paraneoplas tic LEMS, 2) immunologic 
treatments (e .g. intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ), plasma exchange, immunoadsorption, 
prednisone, azathioprine) to suppress anti -VGCC  antibodies ; and 3)  symptomatic treatment 
(e.g. pyridostigmine, amifampridine) acting at the NMJ  (Verschuuren, 2006) . 
 
The most common cancer accompanying LEMS is SCLC, but lymphoproliferative disorders 
such as Hodgkins Disease, carcinoid or malignant thymoma may also occur . Although there 
are no large clinical studies addressing immunotherapy, standard approaches have been 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 19 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
developed from small clinical trials, case reports, and clinical experience in the more frequent 
NMJ autoimmune disorder, myasthenia gravis (MG) . Intravenous immunoglobulin has been 
demonstrated to increase muscular strength in small clinical trials and can be a maintenance therapy if administered approximately monthly. Prednisone is typically started at approximately 1 mg/kg/day, maintained at that dosage until there is clinical evidence of improvement, and then slowly tapered. The most frequently used steroid- sparing oral 
immunosuppressants are azathioprine or mycophenolate. Although evidence is limited, cyclosporine and plasmapheresis are sometimes used in refractory patients . As in other 
autoimmune disorders, immunologic agents are often used in combination. Although most 
experts recommend using similar immunotherapy in paraneoplastic and autoimmune LEMS, some physicians are reluctant to immunosuppress pat ients with malignancy  (Weinberg,  2010). 
 
Symptomatic treatment is integral to the management of LEMS, and typically is started prior 
to immunotherapy . The first available symptomatic treatment was guanidine, which acts by  
increasing transmitter release from presynaptic terminals. However, a small therapeutic window with side effects of marrow suppression and nephrotoxicity limited its use. Cholinesterase inhibitors alone (e .g. pyridostigmine) confer little benefit in LEMS 
(Wirtz,  2009) , although are sometimes used in combination with guanidine. Aminopyridines,  
such as amifampridine, are first -line symptomatic therapy for patients with LEMS  (Skeie, 
2006; S keie, 2010; Lindquist, 2011). 
 
6.2 Amifampridine  
Amifampridine (3,4- DAP) is a non- specific voltage -dependent potassium (K
+) channel blocker 
used to treat LEMS . Its blockade of K+ channels causes depolarization of the presynaptic 
membrane and slows down or inhibits the repolarization phase of an action potential. Prolongation of the action potential duration increased opening of pre -synaptic slow voltage -
dependent calcium (Ca
2+) channels, increasing  Ca2+ influx and consequent increase in synaptic 
vesicle exocy tosis (quantal content) with each depolarization event, thus releasing an increased 
level of ACh into the synaptic cleft ( Maddison, 1998a ; Maddison, 1998b) . The influx of ACh 
into the presynaptic cleft enhances neuromuscular transmission, providing improved muscle function. 
 Over the last 25 years, a considerable amount of clinical experience with amifampridine has 
been gained, which provides a strong body of evidence for its efficacy a nd safety in the 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 20 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
treatment of patients with neurologic disorders, including MG, CMS, LEMS, multiple sclerosis 
(MS), downbeat nystagmus, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  
Amifampridine has been recommended as first -line symptomatic treatment for LEMS by the 
European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) ( Skeie, 2006;  Skeie, 2010;  Lindquist, 
2011)  and amifampridine tablets 10 mg (as amifampridine phosphate) (Firdapse® Tablets) is 
marketed for the treatment of LEMS in the European Union (including Norway and Iceland), Israel, and Switzerland. The collective body of da ta indicates that amifampridine/ 
amifampridine phosphate is well tolerated up to and including 80 mg/day (Firdapse 
Investigator Brochure, February 2015 ). 
 
6.3 Nonclinical Studies  
An extensive nonclinical program assessed the safety and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of amifampridine, including:  
• Five safety pharmacology studies in central nervous system (rat), respiratory (rat), 
and cardiovascular (telemeterized dogs, in vitro human Ether -à-go-go Re lated 
Gene
 (hERG) and rabbit Purkinje fiber)  
• Pharmacokinetics and mass balance in rat and dog  
• In vitro metabolism in human and animal hepatocytes  
• Human hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP450) inhibition and induction  
• Human P -glycoprotein (Pgp) interaction  
• Single dose toxicity and toxicokinetic (TK) studies in mouse , rat, and beagle dog 
• Repeat dose toxicity and toxicokinetic in rat (28- day and 13- week) and  
dog (28 -day and 9 -month)  
• Reproductive and developmental toxicity in rat and rabbit  
• Six in vitro and  in vivo genotoxicity studies  
• Carcinogenitcity study  (104 weeks) in rats  
 
Safety factors based on data from the 4 -week toxicity/TK studies in rat and dog, the 13- week 
toxicity/TK study in rats along with a PK study in fasted rats are presented in Table 2 . Peak 
plasma concentration  (Cmax) values were used in calculating the exposure- based safety factors 
as the central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) effects are 
correlat ed to plasma concentration levels. C max data from the bioavailability/bioequivalence 
study in healthy volunteers were used to compare with animal C max data. Human safety factors 
calculated using mean C max from a PK study in fasted rats are 2.8 (male) and 7 .8 (female). The 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2

safety factor based on average C max in male and female dog versus human is 1.2 and 1.1, 
respectively.

The main nonclinical findings of CNS and ANS effects and histologic changes in muscle 
tissues after administration of amifampridine are in accordance with the mechanism of action. No new treatment -related findings in the nonclinical program have been observed that would 
limit the use of amifampridine at the planned clinical maximum daily oral dose of 80 mg in 
this study involving patients with LEMS . 
 
6.3.1 Carcinogenicity Study  
A study of  amifampridine phosphate  consumption equivalent to 8, 25, or 55 mg/kg/day  via 
dietary admixture in m ale and female Spra gue Dawley rats  showed no increased early 
mortality.  Sur vival was increased in male and female rats offered amifampridine phosphate  in 
diet compared to control group rats.  Survival at the end of the dosing phase was 47%, 67%, 73%, and 72% for males, and 48%, 65%, 60%, and 73% for females for dose levels of 0, 8, 25, and 55 mg/kg/day , respectively.

Amendment 2 Version 2

Benign and malignant Schwannomas were only observed in male and female rats given 
amifampridine phosphate .  In male rats, incidence of Schwannoma was comparable between 
rats given 25  and 55 mg/kg/day.  In female rats, incidence was similar to the male rats at 8 and 
25 mg/kg/day with an increased incidence at the highest dose (55 mg/kg/day).   
Endometrial carcinomas were observed with an incidence of 0, 4, 13 and 9 for females offered 0, 8, 25 and 55 mg/kg/day amifampridine phosphate .  A vast majority (22/26 tumors) of these 
tumors were observed after Study Week 100 and the remaining four were observed in rats between Study Weeks 86 -99.  The late onset of these tumors parallels the extended survival 
noted in test article -treated rats.  The late appearance of these suggests the tumors arise from 
an epigenetic (non -genotoxic) mechanism, and as the endometrium is r esponsive to estrogenic 
activity, dose -related changes in pituitary/endocrine axis is the most likely epigenetic factor 
involved with this response. 
The dose levels of 25 and 55 mg/kg/day a mifampridine phosphate  in males, and the dose levels 
of 8, 25, and 55 mg/kg/day in females were associated with a higher incidence of benign and 
malignant Schwannomas.  Consequently, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 
considered 8 mg/kg/day in males and <8 mg/kg/day in females.   
6.4 Previous Clinical Studies  
Amifampridine has been used for over 25 years in patients with multiple neurologic disorders 
including MG, CMS, LEMS, MS, ALS, congenital forms of nystagmus, and adult idiopathic 
nystagmus (AIN). There are a limited number of published controlled trials with  
amifampridine in these disorders. A review of the literature documents that amifampridine is a safe and effective treatment in multiple neurologic disorders and is recommended by the EFNS for first -line symptomatic treatment of patients with LEMS ( Skeie, 2006; Skeie, 2010;  
Lindquist, 2011) . 
 
6.4.1 Amifampridine Phosphate in Healthy Subjects  
A first in human Phase 1 study ( DAPSEL Study, 2006) with amifampridine phosphate was 
conducted to investigate the bioavailability/bioequivalence and tolerability of amifampridine administered as a phosphate salt or free base. In the first part of the study, a pilot tolerance study was conducted in 5 healthy male  volunteers who received a single 10- mg dose of 
amifampridine phosphate to determine tolerability. In the second part of the study, bioequivalence testing was conducted in 27 healthy male volunteers. Each patient was 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 23 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
randomized to receive either a single dose (2 × 10 mg tablets) of amifampridine as 
amifampridine phosphate or amifampridine base and received alternate treatment following a 
minimum of 72 -hour washout period. 
 
This study demonstrated bioequivalence for  area under the plasma concentration -time c urve 
from time 0 to infinity  (AUC 0-∞), with the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the base/salt ratio 
of 93.1% to 113.3% falling within the predefined limits of 90% to 125% for bioequivalence. 
The mean elimination half -life ( t1/2) of amifampridine was 1.8 hours for the phosphate and 
1.6 hours for the free base form. Amifampridine C max was 64.8 ng/mL for the phosphate and 
57.0 ng/mL for the free base form. Potentially improved absorption of the phosphate salt explained the slightly higher C
max observed for am ifampridine phosphate compared with the 
free base. All adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate, transitory and fully reversible. The nature and frequency of side -effects did not differ between formulations (phosphate salt 
or base). The most common AE (25 of 40 AEs) was paresthesia, which was mainly minor peri -
oral paresthesia. Since paresthesia is well recognized as an AE occurring in patients treated with amifampridine, all were considered as possibly related to investigational product (IP) by the inves tigator. The only other AE occurring in >1 patient and judged possibly related to 
amifampridine was abdominal pain (4 events). Simple flu (5 events) and feeling of discomfort (2 events) were also reported for > 1 patient in the study, however were consider ed not related 
to amifampridine treatment.  
 
The only SAEs reported in the study were minor, isolated, and reversible increases in aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which occurred in a single 
patient after administration o f 20 mg amifampridine base. Aside from this 1  patient, no other 
laboratory abnormalities were observed. No electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were 
observed. No deaths occurred in the DAPSEL study .  
 
A Phase 1 study (LMS -001) in healthy volunteers evalua ted whether food consumption 
significantly affected the bioavailability of amifampridine phosphate tablets. This was an open -
label, randomized, single -dose, 2- treatment, 2 -period crossover design in 46 healthy 
volunteers. Each patient received 20 mg amifam pridine phosphate on 2 occasions, once fasting 
and once after consumption of a standard high fat breakfast. The 2 single 20 mg doses of 
amifampridine phosphate were administered 6 days apart. Data indicate that taking amifampridine with food reduces exposures determined by C
max (maximum serum levels) by 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 24 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
approximately 40% and AUC by approximately 20%. In addition, the time to maximum serum 
concentrations (T max) was increased 2 -fold from approximately 38 minutes (fasted) to 78 
minutes (fed). The drug was well  tolerated with no serious adverse events and only 1 severe 
event, an episode of gastroenteritis unrelated to amifampridine. The most common adverse 
events occurring in ≥  10% of patients were: oral paresthesia (20 patients; 43%), peripheral 
paresthesias (1 2; 26%), dizziness (5; 11%), headache (5; 11%), and oral hypoesthesia (5; 11%). 
Abdominal pain, nausea, peripheral paresthesias, dizziness, and headache were more 
commonly reported by patients following administration of amifampridine phosphate in the 
fasted state; therefore, administration with food is recommended based on the current study.  
 
In both Study LMS -001 and DAPSEL , PK parameters were highly variable with 10- fold ranges 
observed in values of C max, AUC, and t ½ across patients. In humans, amifampri dine is 
exclusively metabolized to a single major metabolite, 3 -N-acetyl amifampridine, via N -acetyl 
transferases (NAT) (Catalyst internal in vitro  and in vivo studies; data available upon request). 
There are 2 NAT enzymes, NAT1 and NAT2, both of which are  principally hepatic and both 
of which are highly polymorphic. These allelic variations lead to slow and fast metabolism 
variations, which have been well characterized in the Caucasian and Asian populations, but somewhat less well in African populations ( Sabbagh, 2006) . Slow acetylators are estimated to 
comprise 50% to 59% of the Caucasian population, with the remainder being rapid acetylators (fast + intermediate). Fast acetylators are over represented in Asian population  (92% of 
Japanese and 80% of Chinese) while they may be under represented in African populations (25%) (Cascorbi, 1995) . Slow acetylators will accumulate drug to higher levels (i.e. higher 
C
max) and clear drug more slowly  (i.e. longer t 1/2), both of which may increase the risk of drug 
related toxicity (Fukino,  2008;  Jetter, 2009) . It is hypothesized that the high variability in 
amifampridine phosphate PK  may be due to NAT polymorphisms with slow and fast acetylator 
phenotypes. In a study (FIR -001) that evaluated the effect of acetylator status in 26  healthy 
subjects (half with fast and half with slow acetylator phenotypes), polymorphisms in the NAT system  created 3 - to 4-fold differences in plasma amifampridine levels. Potentially information 
relating NAT genotype and amifampridine phosphate PK could be used to inform dose selection for individual patients and to lower incidence of dose -related side effect s. 
 
6.4.2 Efficacy of Amifampridine in LEMS  
A Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study ( LMS -002) evaluated the 
efficacy and safety of amifampridine tablets 10 mg, as amifampridine phosphate (30- 80 mg 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2

Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
total daily dose) versus placebo in patient s with LEMS.  The 38 patients treated with 
amifampridine phosphate had statistically significant improvement in both primary efficacy 
measures relative to patients treated with placebo. The change in QMG scores from baseline (Day 1, Part  2) to Day 14 (Part 3) reached statistical significance (p=0.0452), with the least 
square (LS) mean for QMG score increasing by 2.2 in placebo- treated patients, and increasing 
by 0.4 in amifampridine -treated patients. For the other primary endpoint, subject global 
impression (SGI), patients who were receiving amifampridine on Day  1 reported, on average, 
that they were “pleased” (SGI score of 5.9 ±  1.2) with the test medication while they were 
receiving it. After being switched to placebo tablets, their opinions dropped, on ave rage, 2.7 
±2.3 points. The LS mean was - 2.6 for the placebo group and - 0.8 for the amifampridine group, 
a difference of 1.8 ±0.6 (p=0.0028), corresponding to a patient assessment, of “mixed” for the placebo tablets. This substantial change in patients’ ass essments, to a worsening of their 
condition while receiving placebo, was considered clinically significant.  
 
In addition to Study LMS -002, 5 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled studies and 
1 double -blind study with an active comparator (reported in abstract form only) in 71 patients 
with LEMS are reported in the clinical literature. In all 6  studies, amifampridine (in base form) 
was shown to be more effective for the symptomatic treatment of  LEMS compared with 
placebo or active comparator across a number of independent measures of neurological 
function. Supportive data from multiple published uncontrolled investigations and case reports demonstrate the long -term benefits of treatment with amifampridine in patients with LEMS, 
and show that removal of patients from drug has led to recurrence of underlying symptoms. Refer to the Firdapse Investigator Brochure (February, 2015)  for furthe r details on these 
studies. 
 
6.4.3 Safety of Amifampridine and Amifampridine Phosphate  
Safety data collected from 1,45 5 patients or healthy volunteers in controlled study LMS -002 
(LEMS), controlled and uncontrolled published studies of LEMS or other neurologic 
conditions, a 3- year safety surveillance study (ATU), and PK studies demonstrate 
amifampridine is well tolerated up to and including 80  mg/day (Firdapse Investigator 
Brochure, February 2015 ). The most common adverse events observed from the clinical safety 
data were perioral and peripheral paresthesias and gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, epigastralgia).  These events were typically mild or moderate in severity, and transient, seldom requiring dose reduction or withdrawal from tr eatment. In the 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 26 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
pharmacogenomic study in healthy subjects (classified as either slow acetylators or fast 
acetylators), slow acetylators experienced >80% more drug -related AEs compared with fast 
acetylators ( FIR-001). 
 
Clinically significant or serious adverse events were infrequent in all studies for all indications. 
A total of 12 deaths were reported in the 1,455  patients or healthy subjects. Six of 12 deaths 
were associated with accompanying malignancy (1 of 6 with pulmonary embolus as terminal event) , 1 due to tracheobronchitis, and 2 due to myocardial infarction (MI). Attribution to 
amifampridine for 2 of 3 deaths from the ATU study was specified as unrelated; causality for the third death was not reported. No attribution was specified in the academi c series, but the 
author singled out the fatal MI as the only serious incident during amifampridine therapy, implying that the 2  deaths due to malignancy, the 1 due to malignancy and pulmonary embolus 
and the 1 due to tracheobronchitis were not related in his opinion. The author further states that no pathological findings related to amifampridine were found in the patient who died of tracheobronchitis. For 1 of the fatal MIs, the author speculates that a “sudden increase of physical activity” with amifampr idine may have been a contributant (Lundh, 1984; Lundh, 
1993) ; no causality was reported for the other fatal MI (Bertorini, 2011) . Three deaths occurred 
in children with CMS, including 2 with fast -channel CMS (Beeson, 2005) . Although no causal 
relationship was established with amifampridine, the authors advise its use cautiously in children and in fast -channel patients.  The other CMS death was not thought to be related to 
amifampridine (Palace, 1991) . Overall 7 of 12 deaths were not considered related to 
amifampridine; neither cause nor causality is known for 4 deaths; and amifampridine  may have 
contributed indirectly to 1 of the MI -related deaths.  
The most frequent clinically significant or serious event was seizure. A total of 11  (0.76%) 
patients out of 1,455 patients or healthy subjects experienced seizures or convulsions after 
treatm ent with amifampridine. Electroencephalogram findings, reported for 4  of the 11 
patients, did not show epileptiform activity. Four  of 11 seizures occurred in patients with 
LEMS ( 4/209; 1.91%), 4  occurred in patients with MS (4/774; 0.5%), 1 occurred in a patient 
with CMS (1/88; 1.14%) (Harper, 2000)  and 2 seizures were reported in a literature- based 
study where both MG and LEMS patients were enrolled, but the paper did not state the indication (Sanders, 1993; Sanders, 2000; Flet, 2010; McEvoy, 1989;  Boerma, 1995;  Beve r, 
1996) .  
Amifampridine was implicated in 5  of these cases of seizure. Three patients experienced 
seizures on a daily dose of ≥90 mg/day (n=3; LEMS or MG). Contributing factors for seizures 
were a daily dose of  ≥90 mg/day, concurrent treatment with theophylline, brain metastases, 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2

Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
and a case of drug overdose (360 mg/day for 7 days).  In cases where follow -up was reported, 
most seizures did not recur with amif ampridine dose reduction or treatment withdrawal. In the 
one accidental overdose case, seizures were controlled with intravenous clonazepam and the 
patient made a full recovery (Boerma, 1995) . Note that a seizure rate of 4% can be expected in 
the natural course of patients with MS (Engelsen, 1997;  Moreau, 1998; Kinnunen, 1987).  
Among the 774 MS patients treated with ami fampridine included in the safety assessment of 
this report, 4 (0.5%) experienced seizures. 
 
Other clinically significant or SAEs reported in more than 1 adult patient were palpitations 
(8/1,454; 0.56%), abnormal liver enzymes (6/1,454; 0.41%), QTc prolong ation (2/1,454; 
0.14%), and premature ventricular contraction/increased ventricular extrasystoles (2/1,454; 
0.14%). Each of the following serious or clinically significant events was reported in a single patient: chorea, paresthesias, paroxysmal supraventr icular tachycardia, cardiac arrest, drug -
induced hepatitis, gastroesophageal reflux, increased lipase and amylase, aspiration pneumonia with confusion, and urinary tract infection with confusion. 
 
6.4.4 Overall Risks and Benefits  
Data on amifampridine treatment in patients or healthy volunteers support the favorable safety 
profile of amifampridine (both base and phosphate formulations) at doses up to 80 mg per day. 
Current data demonstrate that amifampridine phosphate salt has an acceptable tolerability profile w ith a positive risk -benefit in patients treated with amifampridine. Refer to the Firdapse 
Investigator Brochure (February, 2015)  for further discussion on benefit/risk of amifampridine.  
 
6.4.5 Study Rationale  
As discussed previously , a considerable amount of cl inical experience is available with 
amifampridine (3,4- diaminopyridine; 3,4- DAP) in patients with LEMS and other neurologic 
disorders and, in December 2009, amifampridine phosphate received marketing approval by the European Commission as Firdapse  for the symptomatic treatment of patients with LEMS.  
LMS -002 also provided Class 1 evidence that amifampridine phosphate provides statistically 
and clinically significant improvement in LEMS patients.  LMS -003 represents a second  
efficacy study.

7 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
7.1 Primary Objectives  
 
The primary objectives of the study are:  
 
• To assess the clinical efficacy of amifampridine phosphate compared t o placebo in 
subjects with LEMS, based upon improvement in subject global impression (SGI) and 
quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) score; and  
 
• To confirm the safety and tolerability of amifampridine phosphate  by adverse event 
reports . 
 
8 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
 
This randomized (1:1), double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group study is designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of amifampridine phosphate in patients diagnosed with LEMS. 
Patients will have been receiving unb linded drug treatment  in the expanded access program 
(EAP -001), after which blinded treatment effect will be assessed for continuation or cessation 
of drug. The study is planned to include approximately 28  male and female patients. The 
planned duration of participation for each patient is 5 days, excluding the screening period, which can last up to 7 days.   
 
Those patients successfully satisfy ing all screening criteria will be randomized to a treatment 
group. Amifampridine phosphate (at the patient’s optimal dose) or placebo will be dispensed 
by the site pharmacist, according to the randomization schedule, to begin with the next dose 
after all Day 0 assessments are completed and continued for 4 days .  After completion of the 
study , patients will be eligible for expanded access treatment program with open -label 
amifampridine phosphate. Since patients will have been out of the expanded accesss program 
for less than 30 days, as LMS -003 participants, rescreening to return to expanded access 
program will not  be required, per the protocol , and patients may immediately resume their 
participation in the expanded access program (EAP -001).

Screening  
Patients receiving amifampridine phosphate treatment for LEMS, and meeting the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria are eligible to participate in this study. They can be randomized if on stable dose and frequency of amifampridine phosphate  for at least 1 week before being 
randomized to a treatment.  Screening and randomization (Day 0) may be combined into a 
single visit.  
 
Treatment  (Days 1- 4)
 (+1 day)  
Patients will be randomized (1:1  ratio) on the last day of the screening period (Day  0) to  either 
amifampridine phosphate or placebo. Beginning  with the next dose after all Day 0 assessments 
are completed,  the patient will take, under double -blind conditions, either amifampridine 
phosphate tablets or placebo tablets through Day 4, with a clinic  visit on the last day (Day 4) 
for assessments  (Table 3). Any unused portion of dispensed drug will be returned to the 
pharmacy.  
 
During the study, safety and efficacy assessments will be made as detailed in the Schedule of 
Assessmen ts in Table 3.

8.2.3 Removal of Patients from Treatment or Assessment  
Patients may withdraw their consent to participate in the study or refuse to receive treatment 
with IP at any time without prejud ice. The investigator must withdraw from the study or from 
treatment with IP any patient who requests to be withdrawn.  A patient’s participation in the 
study or treatment with IP may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the investigator 
and in accordance with his or her clinical judgment. In the event that the patient’s LEMS 
symptoms worsen to a clinically significant level, in the opinion of the Investigator, the patient 
may be placed on open -label amifampridine phosphate, and Early Discontinua tion assessments 
should be performed as described for Day 4 (Table 3 ). 
 
Catalyst must be notified of all patient withdrawals from the study or from treatment with IP as soon as possible. Catalyst also reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for either clinical or administrative reasons and to discontinue partic ipation by an individual 
Investigator or site for poor enrollment or noncompliance.
 
 
Reasons for which the I nvestigator or Catalyst may withdraw a patient from the study treatment 
include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 
• Patient experiences a serious or intolerable AE;  
• Patient requires medication prohibited by the protocol; and 
• Patient becomes pregnant.  
 
Reasons for which the I nvestigator or Catalyst may withdraw a patient from the study include, 
but are not limited to, the following:  
 
• Patient does not adhere to study requirements specified in the protocol;  
• Patient was erroneously admitted into the study or does not meet inclusion 
criteria;  and 
• Patient is lost to follow -up. 
 
If a patient fails to return for scheduled visits, a documented effort must be made to determine 
the reason. If the patient cannot be reached by telephone, a certified letter should be sent to the patient requesting co ntact with the I nvestigator. This information should be recorded in the 
study records.
 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2

Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
 
The I nvestigator or d esignee must explain to each patient, before enrollment into the study, 
that for evaluation of study results, the patient’s protected health information obtained during 
the study may be shared with Catalyst, regulatory agenci es, and IRB/IEC/REB. It is the 
Investigator’s (or designee’s) responsibility to obtain written permission to use protected health 
information, per country -specific regulations, from each patient. If permission to use protected 
health infor mation is withdrawn, it is the I nvestigator’s re sponsibility to obtain a written 
request, to ensure that no further data will be collected from the patient and the patient will be removed from the study.
 
 
8.2.4 Patient Identification and Randomization 
Each patient will be assigned a unique patient identification number. Upon signing of the ICF, subjects will be assigned an ID composed of a 2 digit site number and a 3 or 4 digit subject 
number. Screen failures that are allowed to repeat screening ( Section 8.2.5)  will be assigned a 
new ID  and the previous ID will be kept as part of the record. Randomized s ubjects that drop 
out of the study may be replaced. 
 
 
Randomization will be across sites to maintain the 1:1 ratio of drug: placebo assignment. The 
assignments to treatment ( amifampridine  phosphate  or placebo) will be based on a computer -
generated randomization code. Study site Pharmacy will obtain the treatment group  for the 
subject to be enrolled at the time of randomization  (Day  0). 
 
8.2.5 Re-screening  
Re-screening of screen failures will be allowed, if re- screening is approved by the Medical 
Monitor. Justification of the reason for re -screening must be clearly stated in the patient’s 
source documentation. No new consent would be required if re -screened within 30 days.  
 
8.3 Treatments  
 
8.3.1 Treatments Administered  
Catalyst or its designee will provide the study site with a supply of IP sufficient for the completion of the study.
 
  
Investigational product : Amifampridine phosphate tablets 10 mg will be provided in round, 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 34 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
white -scored tablets, and containing amifampridine phosphate formulated to be the equivalent 
of 10 mg amifampridine base per tablet. The product will be provided to the site pharmacy 
departm ent, who will dispense the necessary amount for each part of the study.  
The product will be blinded, neither the  invesigator nor the patient will know what product 
they are assigned.  
 
Placebo : A placebo equivalent will be provided as tablets indistinguisha ble from the 
amifampridine phosphate tablets . The placebo will be administered consistent with the dose 
regimen of amifampridine phosphate. The product will be blinded, neither the Investigator nor 
the patient will know what product they are assigned.  
  
8.3.2 Identity of Investigational Product  
The chemical name of amifampridine phosphate is:  
3,4-pyridinediamine, phosphate (1:1) diamino- 3,4-pyridine, phosphate salt  
3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate  
The chemical structure is provided in  Figure 1 . 
Figure 1.  Chemical Structure of Amifampridine Phosphate  
 
8.3.2.1 Product Characteristics and Labeling  
Drug product is formulated as a phosphate salt of amifampridine. Tablets were developed to 
provide the equivalent of 10 mg of amifampridine base for oral administration. Each tablet contains amifampridine phosphate, microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal an hydrous silica, and 
calcium stearate. The containers  of tablets are labeled “Amifampridine phosphate Tablets, 
10 mg.”
 
 
The tablets are to be dispensed by the site pharmacy department into suitably sized pharmacy containers  for patient use. Placebo will be provided as tablets indistinguishable from 
amifampridine phosphate. The amifampridine phosphate tablets and placebo tablets will be H3PO4NNH2

clearly labeled and the pharmacist is responsible for dispensing the amifampridine phosphate 
tablets or placebo tablets, in a blinded fashion, for each patient , according to the randomization 
schedule provided.  
 
Each contianer  will be labeled to include the study number , site number, patient ID number, 
date dispensed, storage instructions, the statement ‘Caution – New Drug –  Limited by Federal 
law to investigational use,’ trial number, manufacturer name and address, and area for instructions for use. 
 
 
8.3.2.2  Storage  
At the study site, all IP must be stored at room temperature (20 -25 degrees Celsius) and in a 
secure area accessible on ly to the designated pharmacist and clinical site personnel. All IP must 
be stored and inventoried, and the inventories must be carefully and accurately documented according to applicable national and local regulations, ICH GCP, and study procedures.  
 
8.3.3 Directions for Administration   
The dose of amifampridine phosphate will be individually determined by the Investigator, within the bounds of a total daily dose of 30 mg to 80 mg, divided into doses taken 3 to 4 times per day as prescribed by the Investigator, based on optimal neuromuscular benefit.  
All doses of study medication will be taken orally by mouth.  
Generally, doses of study treatment will be taken outside the clinic, except
 during the in- clinic 
study visit. If the patient takes the dose three or four times a day, the patient should be given specific instructions on dosing relative to the time of their visit to assure a dose will be given during the in- clinic visit, corresponding to the second, third, or fourth dose. A dose must be 
administered in the c linic in order to perform efficacy assessments at the correct time in 
relation to dosing. Safety assessments are to be performed before the dose administered to 
the patient during the scheduled in- clinic visit. All efficacy assessments will be performed at  
times relative to the dose administered in the clinic. In this case, the dose will be 40 minutes 
before the first efficacy assessment.

If the patient is taking pyridostigmine, the dosing schedule must be fixed in relation to when 
they take the IP, such that on the days of clinic assessments the timing between pyridostigmine dose and IP do not vary.   
 
Assessments for each clinic visit mus t be performed relative to the same dose as occurred 
on Day 0.   
 
8.3.4 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
Patients will be randomized Day  0 to either  treatment group  in a 1:1 ratio. IP will be 
administered under double -blind conditions such that neither the Investigator nor patient 
knows if they are taking placebo or amifampridine phosphate .  
The randomization code will be provided by Catalyst or designee to the site Pharmacist. Details 
will be included in the Pharmacy Manual.  
 
8.3.5 Selection of Doses  Used in the Study  
The amifampridine phospha te dose is 3 0 mg to 80 mg total daily dose, given in 3 to 4 divided 
doses, with no single dose > 20 mg. Safety of a single maximum dose of 20 mg is based on 
completed animal and in vitro  pharmacology, PK, and toxi cology studies.

8.3.6 Blinding  
This is a double -blind study where both the patients and I nvestigator will be blinded to 
treatment assignment.  
 
8.3.7 Treatment Compliance  
Patients will be instructed to return all IP containers and remaining study medication at the  
study clinic visit. Patient compliance with the dosing regimen will be assessed by 
reconciliation of the used and unused IP. The quantity dispensed, returned, used, lost, etc., 
must be recorded on the medication dispensing log provided for the study.  Urine sp ecimens 
will be collected to further assess treatment compliance.  
 
8.3.8 Inves tigational Product Accountability 
The study site pharmacy is responsible for maintaining accurate records (including dates and quantities) of IP(s) received, patients to whom IP is dis pensed (patient -by-patient dose specific 
accounting), IP returned, and IP lost or destroyed. The Investigator, study site pharmacy or 
designee must retain all unused or expired study supplies until the study monitor (CRA) has confirmed the accountability d ata. 
 
8.3.9 Return and Disposition of Clinical Supplies  
Unused IP must be kept in a secure location for accountability and reconciliation by the study monitor. The Investigator or designee must provide an explanation for any destroyed or 
missing IP or study mate rials.  
 
The monitor must account for all IP in a formal reconciliation process prior to IP destruction. 
Unused IP will be returned to Catalyst. The return of IP or IP materials must be accounted for 
on a Study Drug Return Form provided by Catalyst. 
 All IP  and related materials should be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and returned according 
to applicable study procedures.  
 
8.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All prescription and over -the-counter medications and herbal and nutritional supplements 
taken by a patient for 14 days before the Screening visit will be recorded on the designated 
case report form (CRF).  
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2

Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
 
The I nvestigator may prescribe additional medications during the study, as long as the 
prescribed medication is not prohibited by the protocol. In t he event of an emergency, any 
needed medications may be prescribed without prior approval, but the Medical Monitor must 
be notified of the use of any contraindicated medications immediately thereafter. Any concomitant medications added or discontinued duri ng the study should be recorded on the 
CRF.  
Medications prohibited during the study are listed in Table 4 .

8.5 Dietary or Other Protocol Restrictions  
 
8.5.1 Dietary Restrictions  
There are no dietary restrictions for patients during any part of this study.  
 
8.5.2 Contraception  
Sexually active males and females of childbearing potential must use effective forms of contraception, such as condom for males or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) for females, during the study.  
 
8.6 Safety Variables  
Safety in this study will be determined from evaluation of AEs/SAEs, vital signs assessments, and physical examinations. Pregnancy testing is also required for females of childbearing potential. The timing of the required evaluations is described in the Sc hedule of Events in Table 
3.

8.6.1 Adverse Events  
The determination, evaluation and reporting of AEs will be performed as outlined in Adverse 
Events . 
 
8.6.2 Vital Signs  
Specific visits for obtaining vital signs are provided in Table 3  and in Section 11. Vital signs 
will be measured while in a sitting position, after resting for 5 minutes, and include SBP and 
DBP measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), heart rate in beats per minute. Weight (kg) and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) will also be measured. Clinical ly significant changes 
from baseline will be recorded as AEs.  
 
8.6.3 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Since LEMS can be associated with neoplastic disease, all patients who enter the trial will have the option to participate in cancer screening using the ‘liquid biopsy’ technique, eve ry 6 months 
for 2 years.  
 
The procedure involves collecting tube s of blood which is then incubated with a variety of 
antibodies directed towards circulating tumor cells.  Additional analysis of identified cells may 
then be performed. Follow -up screening will be performed by expanded access clinical sites.  
 
8.6.4 Pregnancy Testing  
Female patients of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test at Screening . If the 
test is equivacol or there is another conern about pregnancy, a serum pregnancy test may be performed. Female patients with a positive pregnancy test at Screening do not meet eligibility criteria for enrollment.  
 
Refer to Section 9.4 for details on  the reporting procedures to follow in the event of pregnancy.  
 
8.6.5 Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed at the time points specified in the Schedule 
of Events in Table 3  and in Section 11. Complete  physical examination will include 
assessments of general appearance as well as the following:  
• Head

Primary Efficacy Variables  
 
8.7.1 Subject  Global  Impression  
The SGI (Farrar, 2001)  is a 7 -point scale on which the patient rates their global impression of 
the effects of a study treatment (1 = terrible to 7 = delighted). The SGI will be assessed by the 
patient or the patient’s parent/guardian/caregiver if the patient is unable to complete the SGI. 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 41 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
The SGI has demonstrated concordance with the physician’s assessment of improvement 
(Dodick, 2007) . Instructions for the SGI are provided in Appendix 2 and the LMS -003 Study 
Reference Manual.  
 
8.7.2 Quantitative Myasthe nia Gravis  
The QMG is a physician -rated test including 13 assessments such as facial 
strength, swallowing, grip strength, and duration of time that limbs can be maintained in outstretched  positions. The QMG was first developed by Besinger (Besinger,  1983) , 
expanded by Tindall (Tindall, 1993; Tindall, 1987);  and subsequently further modified by 
Barohn ( Appendix 1) (Barohn, 1998) . His modified QMG has been assessed for inter -rater 
reliability and was used as the outcome measure in a prospective study of IVIG for MG (Wolfe, 2002)  and two studies of amifampridine for LEMS (Sanders,  2000; Oh, 2009) . Instructions for

Secondary Efficacy Variable  
 
8.7.3 Clinical Global Impression of Improvement  
The CGI -I captures the I nvestigator’s global impression of the patient’s improvement or  
worsening from baseline  status.  The 7- point scale is s cored by the I nvestigator based on 
changes in symptoms, behavior, and functional abilities.  Instruct ions for the CGI -I are 
contained in Appendix 3 and the LMS -003 Study Reference Manual.  
 Exploratory Efficacy Variables  
 
8.7.4 Triple Timed Up and Go  (3TUG) – greater than 20% increase in average time, 
off medica tion 
The Timed Up and Go (TUG) is a functional mobi lity test that requires a subject to stand up 
from a straight -backed armchair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back, and sit down in the 
chair. A modification of this is where the individual performs the test three times without 
pause, and the measurement  is the average time required to complete each of the 3 repetitions.  
Based upon literature reports that a significant change in gait for a similar walk -test is an 
increase in time of more than 20% , this has been incorporated into the endpoint. 
Instruction s for the 3TUG are contained in Appendix 4 and the LMS -003 Study Reference 
Manual.

8.7.5 Patient Evaluation of Most Bothersome Symptom  
Patients identify their most bothersome LEMS -associated symptom as a measure of patient 
satisfaction with the treatment. The evaluation consists of 2 questions, the first is to identify 
before treatment or while off medication, what the patient perceived as their most bothersome symptom and the level to which it bothered them, on a 4 point scale. Following blinded treatment with study medication, the patient is asked to evaluate how much the previously 
identified symptom bothered them during the prior 24 hours, on the same 4 point scale. 
 The Symptom Scale is contained in Appendix 5 and the LMS -003 Study Reference Manual.  
 
9 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
9.1 Adverse Events  
For this protocol, a reportable AE is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g. sign, symptom, 
illness, disease or injury) in a patient administered the IP or other protocol -imposed 
intervention, regardless of attributi on. This includes:  
• AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the course of the 
study.  
• Pre-existing me dical conditions judged by the I nvestigator to have worsened in 
severity or frequency or changed in character during the study.  
• Complic ations that occur as a result of non- drug protocol -imposed 
interventions.  
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the IP caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relati onship 
between the IP and the AE.  
 
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series of 
terms relating to a diagnosis.  
 
The study period during which all serious and non-serious AEs will be reported begins after 
informed consent is obtained and  through the last visit on Study Day 4, or at the time of early 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 43 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
discontinuation. The criteria for determining, and the reporting of SAEs is provided in Section 
9.2. 
 The I nvestigator should follow all unresolved AEs until the events are resolved or stabilized, 
the patient is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented 
on the appropr iate CRF page(s) and in the patient’s medical record . 
 
The I nvestigator responsible for the care of the patient or qualified designee will assess AEs 
for severity, relationship to IP, and seriousness (refer to Section 9.2 for SAE definition). 
Severity (as in mild, moderate or severe headache) is not equivalent to seriousness, which is 
based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning. Seriousness ( not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations .  
 
The I nvestigator will determine the severity of each AE using the following Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE  v4) grades defined in Table 5  (the event 
will be recorded on the source documents and AE CRF). Events that are CTCAE grades 4 and 
5 are serious events and require completion of both an SAE form a nd AE CRF. Adverse events 
that do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE as stated below.

Severity  Description  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically sig nificant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; 
limiting self care ADL**.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated.  Note: Grade 4 and 5 
adverse events should always be reported as serious adverse events  
Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
** Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.  
 
The Investigator will suggest the relationship of an AE to the IP and will record it on the source 
documents and AE CRF, using the relations hip categories defined in Table 6. 
The Investigator should review the AE Log for the patient, from the EAP -001 expanded access 
program. Any ongoing/open/unresolved AEs will be transcribed to the LMS -003 study AE 
Log. At the end of patient’s participation in the LMS -003 study, the AE Log should be provided 
to the expanded access program site, so that the expanded access site can update their AE Log 
with any changes.

In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by th e sponsor to the 
original terms entered in the eCRF, using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA) terminology.  
 
9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 1  or 
more of the f ollowing criteria : 
• Is fatal  
• Is life threatening  
o Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the patient at immediate 
risk of death. This definition does not include a reaction that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• Requires or prolongs in- patient hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 46 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, that is, an AE that occurs in the child or fetus 
of a patient exposed to IP prior to conception or during  pregnancy  
• Is an important medical event or reaction.  
For this study, a generalized tonic -clonic convulsion/seizure is to be considered an SAE.  
Any SAE, whether or not considered related to study drug, must be reported within 24 hours 
of knowledge of the event by forwarding (fax, email) the study -specific SA E Report Form to 
Catalyst. The I nvestigator should not wait to collect information that fully documents the SAE 
before notifying Catalyst . As additional information becomes available, including but not 
limited to the outcome of the SAE and any medication or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, it must be reported within 24  hours in a follow -up report to Catalyst . 
 
The I nvestigator should follow all unresolved SAEs until the events are resolved or stabilized, 
the patient is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented 
in the eCRF and in the patient’s medical record.  
 
For some SAEs, Catalyst may follow  up by telephone, fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit to 
obtain additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report 
(e.g. hospital discharge summary, consultant report, autopsy report).  
At the la st scheduled visit, the I nvestigator should instruct each patient to report any subsequent 
SAEs that the patient’s personal physician(s) believes might be related to prior study treatment.  
 
The I nvestigator should notify Catalyst of any death or SAE occur ring at any time after a 
patient has discontinued, or terminated study participation, if felt to be related to prior study 
treatment. Catalyst should also be notified if the I nvestigator should become aware of the 
development of cancer, or of a congenital anomaly, in a subsequently conceived offspring of a patient that participated in this study.  
 
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB will be done in compliance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB and with applicable regulatory requirement s. Adequate 
documentation must be provided showing that the IRB was properly and promptly notified as required.

9.3 Safety Blood Collection  
Patients who experience a serious or severe AE should have, at the discretion of the 
Investigator, a blood sample drawn for safety labs as soon as possible after the AE.  
Additional blood sampling may be performed at any time during the study if warranted to monitor patient safety.  
 
9.4 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy in a patient or partner should be reported within 24 hours  of the site becoming aware 
of the pregnancy  by fax or email of the Pregnancy Report Form  in the study reference materials 
to Catalyst. In addition, pregnancy in a patient is also reporte d on the End of Study CRF. The 
Investigator must make every effort to follow the patient through resolution of the pregnancy 
(delivery or termination) and to report the resolution on the follow -up form ( Pregnancy Report 
Form : Additional Information) in the study reference materials. In the event of pregnancy in 
the partner of a study pa tient, the I nvestigator should make every reasonable attempt to obtain 
the woman’s consent for release of protected health information. 
 
9.5 Urgent Safety Measures  
The regulations governing clinical trials state that the sponsor and I nvestigator are required t o 
take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect subjects against any immediate hazards that 
may affect the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC  (and consistent with the US FDA regulations at 21 CFR 56.108(a)) , 
“…in the light of the circumstances, notably the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the I nvestigator shall take 
appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor shal l forthwith inform the competent authorities of those new events and the measures 
taken and shall ensure that the IRB/EC/REB is notified at the same time.” The reporting period for urgent safety measures is the period from the time of signing of the ICF th rough the 
completion of the last study visit. Investigators are required to report any urgent safety measures with 24  hours.  
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 48 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
Examples of situations that may require urgent safety measures include discovery of the 
following:  
• An immediate need to revise IP administration (i.e. modified dose amount or frequency 
not defined in protocol).  
• Lack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management.  
• Discovery that the quality or safety of IP does not meet established safety requirements.  
 
9.6 Medical Monitor Contact Information  
Contact information and additional requirements will be provided in the L MS-003 Study 
Reference Manual.  
The I nvestigator is encouraged to discuss with the Medical Monitor any AEs for which the 
issue of seriousness is unclear or questioned. Contact information for the study Medical 
Monitor is listed below.

10 APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS  
The measures of safety used in this study are routine clinical procedures. The efficacy measures 
use a variety of approaches to evaluate changes in neuromuscular function and muscle strength. 
These standardized tests have been previously used for determina tion of response to 
therapeutic intervention in patients with MG and in other indications and, thus, are relevant for use in this study in patients with LEMS . 
11 STUDY PROCEDURES  
11.1 Screening Visit  
An ICF must be signed and dated by the patient, the Investigator  or designee, and witness (if 
required) before any study -related procedures are performed.  
After patient has signed an ICF, they will be screened for enrollment into the study. The study activities listed below will be performed during the 7 days  that con stitute the Screening V isit.

medication have been completed . 
 
Patients must be instructed  that they are not to take any doses of their prior, open -label 
amifampridine during the study  and not to change pyridostigmine dose or schedule . 
 
11.3 End of Treatment  (Study Day 4)  
Patients will take their blinded study medication on Days 1 -3.  On Day 4, a d ose of blinded 
study medication must  be administered by the site study personnel.  This is the same 
medication that the patient has been taking on Days 1- 3. The assessments listed below will be 
performed following either the second, third, or fourth dose  of medication to be taken on 
Day 4, and this should be the same dose that assessments on Day 0 were subsequently 
performed . For example, i f the patient took their second dose of amifampridine in the clinic 
on Day 0 and had assessments started 40 minutes l ater, then on Day 4, that patient should be 
assessed after taking their second dose of medication in the clinic, starting 40 minutes after the 
dose. 
 
Safety assessments (vital signs and AEs/SAEs) should be performed before  study personnel 
give the dose of blinded medication. Concomitant medications should be reviewed for any 
changes.  A urine sample, to determine amifampridine level, should be collected on Day 3 (after 
patient has taken a dose of blinded medication) , and on Day 4, before  study personnel give  the 
dose of blinded medication.

At visits during and after the study, a CRA will monitor the site for compliance with regulatory 
documentation. Data quality control and analysis will be performed by Cat alyst, or designee, 
based on a predefined plan. 
 
13 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF  SAMPLE SIZE  
13.1 Determination of Sample Size  
For Change From Baseline in QMG Scores, a between -treatment difference of - 3.5 and a 
standard deviation at most 3, a sample size of at least 24 patients will provide power of  at least 
80% for a 0.05 level test. Similarly, for Change From Baseline in SGI Scores, a between-
treatment difference of -2.1 and a standard deviation at most  2, a sample size of at least 26 
patients will provide power of 80% for a 0.05 level test. Thus a total sample size of 26  patients, 
equally randomized to two treatment sequences, will provide power of at least 80% for each of the two co- primary endpoints. 
 
13.2 Patient Populations  
Analyses will be presented for  
• Safety Population: This population consists of all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of IP (amifampridine or placebo)  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): This population consists of all randomized pat ients who 
receive at least 1 dose of IP (amifampridine or placebo) and have at least one post -
treatment efficacy assessment.  
• Per Protocol (PP): This population is a subset of the FAS population, excluding patients with major protocol deviations. The PP population will include all patients who: 
o Have no major protocol deviations or inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations that might potentially affect efficacy, and  
o Patients who took at least 80% of the required treatment doses and remained enrolled for at l east 4 days.  
 
Evaluations obtained at the time of discontinuation will be included in the analyses. Patients who discontinue with no post -randomization data will be excluded from all efficacy analyses 
but will be included in the safety analyses.

Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
13.3 Safety Analysis  
Safety analyses will be conducted on the Safety P opulation. The safety analysis will be 
descriptive and will be presented using  observed data only.  
 
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
Only TEAE s will be included in the safety analysis. The incidence of TEAEs will be 
summarized by system organ class, preferred term, relationship to IP, and severity by treatment . Deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to premature discontinuation will be listed.  Vital  
signs, ECGs, physical examination data, and concomitant medications will also be 
summarized .  Routine laboratory assessments will not be performed. Laboratory evaluations , 
if performed , will be listed.  
 
13.4 Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analyses will be conducted on the FAS and PP populations, with the FAS population serving as the primary analysis set.  For each efficacy variable with a corresponding assessment at Baseline, Change From Baseline (CFB) will be computed as the post- treatment result minus 
the Baseline r esult.  The post -treatment result will be the result obtained on Day 4, unless the 
subject discontinued treatment early, in which case the post -treatment result may be obtained 
at an earlier time point.  For statistical tests, two -sided P values <0.05 will  be considered as 
statistically significant.  
Summary statistics for QMG score and the corresponding CFB will be presented by treatment.  The analysis of CFB for Total QMG Score is a coprimary efficacy endpoint and analysis will be performed by fitting a fixed effects linear model  to the data with CFB as the response.  The 
model will include terms for treatment and QMG at Baseline.  The following test comparing 
the least squares (LS) means will be conducted to evaluate the treatment effect:  
HA,0: LSMean QMG(A)  = LSMean QMG(P)  vs.  H A,1: LSMean QMG(A) ≠ 
LSMean QMG(P),  
where LSMean QMG (A) is the QMG LS mean of the amifampridine treatment group and 
LSMean QMG(P) is the QMG LS mean of the placebo treatment group.  
The raw scores and CFB for each item of QMG will be summarized by treatment.  Between -
treatment comparisons with respect to CFB for Right arm outstretched, Left arm outstretched, Right leg outstretched, and Left leg outstretched will be performed using a GLM with terms 
for treatment, QMG at Baseline and tr eatment duration (in days).

Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
Summary statistics for SGI score and the corresponding CFB will be presented by treatment. 
The analysis of CFB for SGI is a coprimary efficacy endpoint and analysis will be performed by fitting a fixed  effects linear model to the data with CFB as the response.  The model will 
include terms for treatment and SGI at Baseline.  The following test comparing the LS means 
will be conducted to evaluate the treatment effect:  
HB,0: LSMean SGI(A)  = LSMean SGI(P)  vs.  H B,1: LSMean SGI(A) ≠ LSMean SGI(P), 
where LSMean SGI(A) is the SGI LS mean of the amifampridine treatment group and 
LSMean SGI(P) is the SGI LS mean of the placebo treatment group.  
A sensitivity analysis of the coprimary endpoints will be conducted to evaluate the patterns of early treatment discontinuation.  For each coprimary endpoint, a randomization test will be conducted to determine if the results from the primary analysis are supported.  The randomization test is an alternative to a full permutation, and will evaluate the fixed  effects 
model specified above using permutations of the treatment group assignments.  If early discontinuations are not associated with treatment, then it is expected that the p -value resulting 
from the randomization test will yield the same statistical interpretation as the p -value resulting 
from the primary analysis.    
 The proportion of patients with at least 20% increase in average time  for 3TUG  will be 
summarized by treatment and analyzed u sing Fisher’s Exact Test . The assessment of the 
Patient’s Most Bothersome Symptom  will be summarized by treatment and analyzed u sing a 
Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test . 
 
13.5 Changes in the Conduct of the Study or Planned Analyses  
Any change in study conduct considered necessary by the Investigator will be made only after 
consultation with Catalyst, who will then issue a formal protocol amendment to implement the change. The only exception is when an Invesigator considers t hat a patient’s safety is 
compromised without immediate action.  In these circumstances, immediate approval of the 
IRB/IEC/REB must be sought, and the Investigator should inform Catalyst within 2 working days after the emergency occurs.

14 COM PENSATION, INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY 
There will be no charge to study patients  to be in this study.  Catalyst will pay all costs of test, 
procedures, and treatment that are part of this study (as included in the site budget).  In addition, 
after IRB/IEC/REB approval, Catal yst will pay the cost of travel, lodging  and meals  for study  
duration. Catalyst will not pay for any hospitalizations, tests, or treatment for medical problems of any sort, whether or not related to the study patient’s disease that are not part of this  study.  
Costs associated with hospitalizations, test, and treatments should be billed and collected in the way that such costs are usually billed and collected.  
 
The I nvestigator should contact Catalyst immediately upon notification that a study patient has 
been injured by the IP or by procedures performed as part of the study. Any patient who 
experiences a study -related inju ry should be instructed by the I nvestigator to seek medical 
treatment at the closest medical treatment facility if necessary. The patient should be given the name of a person to contact to seek further information about, and assistance with, treatment for study -related injuries. The treating physician should bill the patient’s health insurance 
company or other third party payer for the cost of this medical treatment. To the extent a patient has reasonably followed the Investigator’s instructions and attempted to comply with study procedur es, Catalyst will pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the injuries 
caused by the IP or study procedures, if these costs are not covered by health insurance or another third party that usually pays these costs. In some jurisdictions, Catalyst is obligated by 
law to pay for study -related injuries without prior recourse to third party payer billing. If this 
is the case, Catalyst will comply with the law.  
 
15 CASE REPORT FORMS AND SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
The CRO data management vendor, or designees , will perform all data management activities, 
including the writing of a data management plan outlining the systems and procedures to be 
used. 
 Study data will be captured on CRFs and will be verified to the source data, which necessitates 
access to all o riginal recordings, laboratory reports, and patient records. In addition, all source 
data should be attributable (signed and dated). The I nvestigator must therefore agree to allow 
direct access to all source data. Patients must also allow access to their m edical records, and 
patients will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement whe n giving informed 
 LMS- 003 
Amendment 2 Version 2  
 Page 56 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  27 April 2017  
consent. The I nvestigator must review and sign the completed CRF casebook to verify its 
accuracy.  
 
16 STUDY MONITORING AND AUDITING  
Qualified individuals approved and/or designated by Catalyst will monitor all aspects of the 
study according to GCP and SOPs for compliance with applicable government regulations. The Investigator agrees to allow these monitors direct access to the clinical supplies, 
dispensing, and storage areas and to the clinical files, including original medical records, of the study patients, and, if requested, agrees to assist the monitors. The Investigator and staff 
are responsible for being present or available for consultation during routinely scheduled site visits conducted by Catalyst or its designees.  
 
Members of Catalyst’s GCP Compliance Department or designees may conduct an audit of a 
clinical site at any time before, during, or after  completion of the study. The I nvestigator will 
be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. Representatives of the FDA or other regulatory agencies may also conduct an audit of the study. If informed of such an inspec tion, the I nvestigator should notify Cataly st immediately. The Investigator will 
ensure that the auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study site facilities, original source documentation, and all study files.  
 
17 RETENTION OF RECORDS  
The Investigator must retain all study records required by  Catalyst and by the applicable 
regulations in a  secure and safe facility. The I nvestigator must consult a Catalyst representative 
before disposal of any study records, and must notify Catalyst of any change in the location, disposition or custody of the s tudy files. The Investigator/institution must take measures to 
prevent accidental or premature destruction of essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copies of study records (e.g. patient charts) as well as any 
original source documents that are electronic as required by applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
All study records must be retained for at least 2 years after the las t approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or (2) at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal

discontinuation of clini cal development of the IP. The I nvestigator/institution should retain 
patient identifiers for at least 15 years after the completion or discontinuation of the study. 
Patient files and other source data must be kept for the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, institution or private practice, but not less than 15 years. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by a Catalyst agreement. Catalyst must be notified and will assist with retention should  
Investigator/institution be unable to continue maintenance of patient files for the full 15 years. 
It is the responsibility of Catalyst to inform the I nvestigator /institution as to when these 
documents no longer need to be retained.  
 
18 USE OF INFORMATION AND PUBLICATION 
Catalyst recognizes the importance of communicating medical study data and therefore 
encourages their publication in reputable scientific journals and at seminars or conferences. The details of the processes of producing and reviewing report s, manuscripts, and 
presentations based on the data from this study will be described in any Clinical Trial 
Agreement .

Appendix 4   Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test  
Equipment : Stopwatch, Standard Chair with a rmrests  and seat height approximately 44 cm (17 
inches) and arm rest height approximately 65 cm (26 inches) , Mea sured distance of of 3 meters 
(9 feet 10 inches ).  
 
Patient Instructions  given by the evaluator : 
 
“Sit in the chair with your back resting on the back of the chair and hands on the armrest s.  At 
the end of the test mat in front of you is a  green  light.  When you see the green light turn on , 
I want you to get up from the chair.  You should use the arms of the chair  to assist in standing 
up or sitting down from the chair.  Walk forward as quickly as you feel comfortable until you 
reach the orange area on the floor marking the end of the course.  You need to be in the orange 
area with both feet, turn around, walk back to the chair, turn around and sit down completely 
in the chair , touching your back to the back of the chair.  Immediately repeat the course I have 
just explained to you two more times.  Therefore, you will complete the course a total of three 
times without resting between each time that you do the course.”  
 “I will record the time it takes you to complete the course three times, with the ending time 
occurring when you sit down in the chair for the third time.  You may not use the wall for 
support. Please try to complete the course three times without resting b etween each time, if 
possible.”  
 
“We will begin in a moment.  Please focus on the light at the end of the cours e and listen for 
the beep.  Begin immediately upon hearing the beep and seeing the light.  Thank you.”  
 
Evaluator instructions:  
 The timing, gait, and progress in this test will be recorded automatically by the Prokinetics 
software, both electronically by the sensor mat and by video camera.  Ensure that the subject’s back is touching the back of the chair at the beginning and end of each cycle of the course.  Ensure that the subject’s wear their regular footwear for the test and that they wear the same footwear each time the test is conducted.  Refer to past records to ensure the subject’s footwear 
has not changed between days.  The subject may use a walking assistive device (cane or walker) if that this their usual and normal practice for walking.  If a wal king assistive device

is used, record the type of device in the source documents.  This device should be used for each 
evaluation .  Subject’s may not be assisted by another person during this test.  If the subject’s 
become fatigued while walking, they may stop and rest, but should not sit down.  Any comments or question directed to the subject during the test should be for safety reasons only and be non- directive.  For example , “Are you ok? ”.  Remember that the entire test is recorded 
by video.

outstretched, Right leg outstretched, and Left leg outstretched  will be performed using a 
GLM with terms for treatment, QMG at Baseline and treatment duration (in days).  
Summary statistics for SGI score and the corresponding CFB will be pre sented by 
treatment. The analysis of CFB for SGI is a coprimary efficacy endpoint and analysis will 
be performed by fitting a GLM  fixed effects linear model to the data with CFB as the 
response.  The model will include terms for treatmen t and;  SGI at Basel ine and treatment 
duration (in days).   The following test comparing the LS means will be conducted to 
evaluate the treatment effect:  
HB,0: LSMean SGI(A)  = LSMean SGI(P)  vs.  H B,1: LSMean SGI(A) ≠ LSMean SGI(P), 
where LSMean SGI(A) is the SGI LS mean of the amifampridine treatment group and 
LSMean SGI(P) is the SGI LS mean of the placebo treatment group.  
A sensitivity analysis of the coprimary endpoints will be conducted to evaluate the patterns 
of early treatment discontinuation.  For each coprimary endpoint , a randomization test 
will be conducted to determine if the results from the primary analysis are supported.  The randomization test is an alternative to a full permutation, and will evaluate the fixed effects model specified above using permutations of t he treatment group assignments.  If 
early discontinuations are not associated with treatment, then it is expected that the p -
value resulting from the randomization test will yield the same statistical interpretation as the p -value resulting from the primar y analysis.

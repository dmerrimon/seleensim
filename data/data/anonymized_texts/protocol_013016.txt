Fludarabine -based Conditioning for Allogeneic Marrow Transplantation from HLA -
compatible Unrelated Donors in Severe Aplastic Anemia  
 
Study Chairperson:  Paolo Anderlini, M.D.  
Primary Objective:  The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and 
toxicity of employing fludarabine -based conditioning to reduce 
transplant -related toxicity while maintaining (or ideally improving) 
engraftment in allogeneic donor marrow transplantation from matched 
(and mismatched) unrelated donors (MUD) in patients with severe 
aplastic anemia (SAA).  The combination of reduced transplant -related 
toxicity and preserved engraftment should translate into improvement 
in long-term survival, which is the ultimate goal of the study.  More 
specifically, the study will determine the degree of cyclophosphamide (CY) dose reduction achievable with the introduction of fludarabine in 
the preparative regimen, with the goal of maintaining (or improving) 
engraftment, reducing major transplant -related toxicity and early 
deaths, and thereby ultimately improving long-term survival.  The 
primary endpoint is selection of the optimal CY dose based on Day 
100 assessments of graft failure (primary and secondary), regimen-
related toxicity and early death.  
Secondary Objectives : Secondary endpoints of clinical interest include post -transplant 
survival, graft failure, and acute and chronic GVHD.  
Study Design:  The study is a prospective Phase I/II dose optimization study.  All 
patients are given a fixed dose of ATG (either thymoglobulin: 3 mg/kg 
IV daily x 3 or ATGAM 30 mg/kg IV daily x 3, on Days – 4 to – 2), 
Fludarabine (30 mg/m
2 IV daily x 4, on Days –  5 to – 2), and TBI (200 
cGy from a linear accelerator at ≤  20 cGy/min on Day – 1).  The 
starting CY dose will be 150 mg/kg (50 mg/kg intravenously daily, 
Days –4 to – 2), and w ill be de -escalated depending on engraftment and 
toxicity.  The Phase I portion of the trial (maximum of 24-27 patients) 
tests each of four dose levels of CY for adequate safety and graft 
retention.  The Phase II portion of the trial refines the dose selec tion 
and allocates an additional 70 patients to the optimal dose, at which 
two-year post -transplant survival will be assessed.  The combined 
enrollment in Phase I and II will total 94 patients.

iii Dosage Levels for CY  
Days  Dose  Total Dose  
3 (Day – 4, –3, –2) 50 mg/kg/day 150 mg/kg 
2 (Day – 3, –2) 50 mg/kg/day 100 mg/kg 
1 (Day –2) 50 mg/kg/day  50 mg/kg  
0 (None)  None      0 mg/kg 
 
Dose Finding Plan 
 
The first patients treated will receive a dose of 50 mg/kg intravenously 
daily, on Days – 4 to – 2 (total dose  of 150 mg/kg).  The doses to be 
considered range from 150 mg/kg to 0 mg/kg, in 50 mg/kg 
decrements.  At each dose level, a minimum of six patients are initially 
evaluated before de -escalating to the next lower dose.  
 The study design uses an adaptive Bayesian method for dose -finding 
in Phase I/II clinical trials based on trade-offs between the true (i.e., population) rates of engraftment and toxicity (i.e., severe clinical 
toxicity, early death or both)
1.   
 
Patients will be enrolled sequentially.  There may be wait periods 
between enrollment of successive patients for endpoint assessments.  Doses for subsequent patients are based on the engraftment and toxicity experience in preceding patients.  The total sample size of 94 
patients enrolled in Phases I and II of the trial contribute to selection of 
the optimal dose.  For a complete description of the Study Design refer 
to Chapter 5 of the Protocol.  
Accrual Objective:  A maximum of 94 patients will be enrolled and followed for 24 
months post -transplant.  
Accrual Period:  The estimated accrual period is eight years.  
Eligibility Criteria:  Patients up to 65 years of age with a diagnosis of SAA and an available u nrelated donor with a 7/8 or 8/8 match for HLA -A, B, C 
(intermediate resolution) and DRB1 (high resolut ion) antigen and 
willing to provide a marrow allograft.

iv Treatment Description : The preparative regimen will consist of:  
- Fludarabine: 30 mg/m2 IV daily x 4, on Days – 5 to – 2 
- Cyclophosphamide (CY):  the CY dose will be de -escalated (see 
Study Design above).  Full details on the de -escalation scheme are 
provided in the Statistical Section (Chapter 5) of the protocol.  
-  Antithymocyte globulin (ATG; Thymoglobulin): 3 mg/kg IV daily 
x 3, on Days – 4 to –2.  A biologically equivalent dose of ATGAM 
(horse ATG; conversion ratio 10:1) is recommended.  
- TBI: 200 cGy from a linear accelerator at ≤ 20 cGy/min on  
Day –1. 
- Day 0 will be the day of infusion.  GVHD prophylaxis will consist of cyclosporine (to be administered for no less than nine months 
after transplant) i n combination with methotrexate at Days 1, 3, 6 
and 11.  Tacrolimus may be substituted for cyclosporine intolerance.  
Study Duration:  Patients will be followed for 24 months post -transplant.

1. BACKGROUND AND STUDY  RATIONALE  
 1.1. Obj ectives  
 The primary objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and toxicity of employing 
fludarabine -based conditioning to reduce transplant -related toxicity while maintaining (or ideally 
improving) engraftment in allogeneic donor stem cell transplantation from matched (and 
mismatched) unrelated donors (MUD) in patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA).  The 
combination of reduced transplant -related toxicity and preserved engraftment should translate 
into improvement in long-term survival, which is the ultimate goal of the study.  
 
More  specifically, the study will determine the degree of cyclophosphamide (CY) dose reduction 
achievable with the introduction of fludarabine in the preparative regimen, with the goal of 
maintaining (or improving) engraftment, reducing major transplant -related toxicity and early 
deaths, and thereby ultimately improving long-term survival.  The primary endpoint of the study 
is selection of the optimal CY dose based on Day 100 assessments of graft failure (primary and 
secondary), major regimen-related toxicity a nd early deaths.  The primary endpoint of the Phase 
II portion of the study is the two-year post -transplant survival achieved with the level of CY dose 
reduction selected in the dose -finding portion of the study.  
 
1.2. Background 
 
Aplastic anemia (AA) remains a life -threatening illness.  Treatment options include supportive 
care (transfusions, growth factors, etc.), immunosuppression therapy and stem cell 
transplantation
2, 3.  Only the latter two have favorably impacted the natural history of the disease.  
The prognosis of AA patients, particularly SAA, as defined by Camitta et al.4, who fail to 
respond to immunosuppressive therapy (IS) or who relapse after an initial response to IS is poor.  
Although many of these patients can be supported in the short term wit h growth factors, 
transfusions and possibly rechallenged successfully with IS, the cumulative morbidity and 
mortality from infection, hemorrhage or transfusion-related complications is substantial.  
 
While allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is potential ly curative in AA, no more than 25% 
of patients have an HLA -identical sibling donor5.  Cyclophosphamide (CY) -ATG has been 
recommended as the preparative regimen of choice in sibling donor transplants6.  Results of bone 
marrow transplantation from alternati ve donors, such as matched unrelated donors and 
mismatched related donors in AA patients who have failed IS, have largely been unsatisfactory5.  
The cyclophosphamide -ATG conditioning regimen has proved inadequat e in ensuring 
engraftment in allogeneic transplants from matched, unrelated donors for AA7.  This was the 
major reason why total body radiation (TBI) has been added to the conditioning regimen.    
Graft failure is a very serious and frequently life -threate ning or fatal event following MUD 
allografts in aplastic anemia.  It is an immunologically mediated event.  Risk factors for graft 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Aplastic Anemia –  Protocol 0301  
  Version 9.0 dat ed June 6, 2013  
 
 
1-2 failure include the use of HLA nonidentical or unrelated donors, a poor marrow nucleated cell dose as well as prolonged trans fusional support prior to BMT (which increases the probability of 
patient sensitization to multiple antigens).  While some patients may achieve autologous hematopoietic recovery, prolonged pancytopenia is common and infection-related morbidity and 
mortalit y are very substantial
5.  Reconditioning for a second allograft from the same or a 
different donor is frequently not successful.  While the addition of TBI and intensive pre -
transplant conditioning has led to a sizable improvement in engraftment rates, this has come with a price, particularly in adult patients.  Transplant -related toxicity has been a major and frequent 
problem.  Radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity in particular has been common, usually in the form of diffuse alveolar damage or diffuse interstitial pneumonitis 
5, 8, 9.  In addition, GVHD -
related morbidity and mortality in these patients have also been substantial.  
 A recent update from the National Marr ow Donor Program on 141 patients showed that only 51 
(36%) were surviving with a median follow -up of 36 months.  Morbidity and mortality was very 
high, largely because of graft failure (11%) and transplant -related toxicities
8.  As stated 
previously, toxicities are thought to be related to the administration of standard-dose TBI and, to a lesser extent, intensive chemotherapy as part of the conditioning regimen, deemed necessary to 
maximize engraftment rates.  
 
More recently, Deeg et al. investigated the option of reducing the intensity of TBI in the 
preparative regimen to minimize TBI -related complications while attempting to preserve the 
beneficial effect of TBI on engraftment.  A TBI de -escalation trial was condu cted in matched, 
unrelated donors, with TBI doses as low as 200 cGy (TBI 200).  All patients received CY (200 mg/kg) and ATG (90 mg/kg). In an initial cohort of 13 patients treated with TBI 200, the graft failure rate was 8% with a 61% survival
10.  Largely based on these data, it was concluded that 
TBI 200 in combination with CY and ATG was sufficient to allow for engraftment without 
inducing prohibitive toxicity.  However, among 45 patients there still were 12 deaths (including 
two early ones), mainly trans plant-related (31%) and major regimen-related toxicities plus early 
deaths in nine patients (20%).  Thirty-three of 45 patients (73%) survived with a variable follow -
up (Deeg J, personal communication, 2004).  
 Purine -analogs, in particular fludarabine, ha ve emerged as powerful immunosuppressive agents 
with minimal systemic toxicities
11.  Fludarabine -based, reduced -intensity preparative regimens 
have been shown to allow alloengraftment in the related and unrelated donor setting with 
acceptable systemic toxicity in patients with a variety of hematologic malignancies12, 13, 14,  15,  16.  
Encouraging data on the fludarabine -cyclophosphamide regimen have been reported 14, 17.  A 
fludarabine -based, less intensive, conditioni ng regimen, with adequate immunosuppressive 
activity could conceivably allow engraftment of stem cells from alternative donors in AA patients with acceptable engraftment rates and low transplant -related mortality.  Regimen -related 
toxicity is believed to be a major contributing factor to GVHD
18, 19.  Therefore this approach 
may also lead to reduced GVHD, as some investigators have suggested20, 21.  Anecdotal 
reports22, 23 suggested the feasibility of this approach, and a recent update has confirmed these 
data.  I n a cohort of 38 patients (median age 14 years) with aplastic anemia transplanted with a 
fludarabine -cyclophosphamide -ATG conditioning regimen, seven patients (18%) experienced 
graft failure, with two cases of autologous reconstitution.  Six of these seven cases were older 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Aplastic Anemia –  Protocol 0301  
  Version 9.0 dat ed June 6, 2013  
 
 
1-3 patients (i.e., >  15 years of age).  Thirty-one patients (82%) engrafted24.  High -dose CY (200 
mg/kg) may lead to substantial morbidity and mortality (cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, 
pulmonary toxicity, hemorrhagic cystitis, mucositis25, 26), and the replacement of at least part 
(and possibly all) of CY by fludarabine in the Deeg regimen would be expected to maintain 
immunosuppression (and therefore engraftment) while reducing transplant -related complications 
(i.e., regimen -related toxicity a nd possibly GVHD), and thereby improve survival.  
 
Conditioning regimens, including high-dose ATG (particularly thymoglobulin) employed in the 
context of matched, unrelated donor marrow transplant, have been associated with Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV) reactiv ation and disease, such as post -transplant lymphoproliferative disorders 
(PTLPD)27, 28.  Molecular monitoring for EBV reactivation in peripheral blood with pre -emptive 
rituximab treatment has been recommended to manage this complication29, 30.  This approach i s 
particularly appealing, as established PTLPD carries a high mortality27, 28.  
 
The role of filgrastim -mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) in matched, unrel ated donor 
transplantation is not well defined, although preliminary data suggest that they can be employed 
safely31, 32.  In the context of aplastic anemia, however, a recent analysis from the Center for 
International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research/European Blood and Marrow Transplant 
Group (CIBMTR/EBMT) has suggested that while after HLA -identical siblings transplants, 
recipients of PBSC transplants have faster engraftment, they also have a poorer long-term 
outcome than bone marrow recipients, largely because of higher incidence of chronic graft -vs-
host disease (GVHD) -related mortality33.  Similar data for MUD allografts are lacking at the 
moment, but at the present time unrelated donor bone marrow remains the preferred stem cell 
source for allografting in AA patients.  In view of these data this study will focus on bone 
marrow as the stem cell source.

2. STUDY DESIGN 
 
2.1.  Study Overview  
 
The purpose of the current study is to continue to optimize conditioning regimens in high-risk patients wit h severe aplastic anemia transplanted with marrow from HLA -compatible unrelated 
donors.  Specifically, the study will determine whether the addition of fludarabine to the 
conditioning regimen previously described by Deeg et al. will permit a reduction in t he CY dose, 
to a point where sustained hematopoietic engraftment and survival are maintained (or improved), 
while the frequency of major regimen-related toxicity (RRT) and early deaths is reduced.  
 
2.2.  Patient Eligibility  
 
2.2.1.  Inclusion Criteria  
 
Patients fulfill ing the following criteria will be eligible for entry into this study:  
1. Patients up to 65 years of age at time of registration with a diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia (SAA)

- Bone m arrow cellularity < 25%, or marrow cellularity < 50% but with < 30% residual 
hematopoietic cells.  
- Two out of three of the following (in peripheral blood): neutrophils < 0.5 x 109/L; 
platelets < 20 x 109/L; reticulocytes < 20 x 109/L. 
SAA diagnostic criteri a may be applied to assessment at initial diagnosis or follow -up 
assessments.  
2. Patient must have an available unrelated donor with a 7/8 or 8/8 match for HLA -A, B, C 
and DRB1 antigen.  Typing is by DNA techniques: intermediate resolution for A, B and 
C, and  high resolution for DRB1.  HLA -DQ typing is recommended but will not count in 
the match.  
3. Patient and/or legal guardian able to provide signed informed consent.  
4. Matched unrelated donor must consent to provide a marrow allograft.  
5. Patients with adequate orga n function as measured by:

1-3 2.3. Treatment/Study Plan  
 
2.3.1.  Preparative Regimen  
 
The preparative regimen will be as follows:  
- Fludarabine: 30 mg/m2 IV over no less than 30 min daily x 4, Days – 5 to – 2.  For patients 
weighing more than 100% of their ideal body weight (IBW), fluda rabine will be dosed 
based on their adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW).  For patients weighing less than 100% 
of their IBW, it is recommended, but not required, that fludarabine be dosed based on 
their IBW.  
 
Recommended Ideal Body Weight (IBW) Formulas:  
 
Patients Over 18 Years  
Males IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet

- Cyclophosphamide (CY): the CY dose, to be given intravenously (IV) over no less than 2 
hours, will be de -escalated as follows:  
 
Dosage Levels for CY  
Days  Dose  Total Dose  
3 (Day – 4, –3, –2) 50 mg/kg/day 150 mg/kg 
2 (Day – 3, –2) 50 mg/kg/day 100 mg/kg 
1 (Day – 2) 50 mg/kg/day 50 mg/kg 
0 (None)  None      0 mg/kg 
The initial CY dose will be 50 mg/kg intravenously x 3 days (Day – 4, –3, and –2).  Full 
details on the de -escalation scheme are provided in the Statistical Section (Chapter 5) of 
the protocol.  Doses and schedule for uroprotective agents (i.e. mesna) should follow 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Aplastic Anemia –  Protocol 0301  
  Version 9.0 dat ed June 6, 2013  
 
 
1-4 local institutional practice.  For patients weighing more than 100% of their ideal body weight (IBW), cyclophosphamide will be dosed based on their adjusted ideal  body 
weight (AIBW).  For patients weighing less than 100% of their IBW, it is recommended, but not required, that cyclophosphamide be dosed based on their IBW.  
 
It is recommended that fludarabine be administered prior to cyclophosphamide.  
 
- Thymoglobulin: 3 mg/kg IV over no less than four (and preferably six) hours daily x 3, 
Days –4 to – 2.  The thymoglobulin dose should ordinarily be calculated based on actual 
body weight.  In the event of institutional preference or thymoglobulin intolerance, 
patients may  receive a biologically equivalent dose of horse ATG (ATGAM or 
comparable product).  A 10:1 conversion ratio is recommended (i.e., 1 mg thymoglobulin 
= 10 mg ATGAM) with regard to dosage calculations.  Thymoglobulin premedication should follow local instit utional practice, but should include a minimum of 100 mg 
methylprednisolone (or equivalent steroid) IV (preferably repeated in 2-3 hours during 
the infusion).  For pediatric patients the methylprednisolone dose should be a minimum 
of 1 mg/kg prior to ATG i nfusion, preferably repeated in three hours.  A 24-hour delay in 
ATG administration to allow for the resolution of ATG -related toxicities is permitted.  
- All three agents (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and thymoglobulin) are commercially 
available and will n ot be provided for the study.  Please refer to the agents’ package 
inserts for additional information.  
- TBI: 200 cGy from a linear accelerator at ≤  20 cGy/min on Day – 1 (single dose).  Lung 
shielding is strongly recommended, but not mandatory.  
 
2.3.2.  Marrow Proce ssing and Handling 
 
Processing of Bone Marrow Products  - No processing of bone marrow, other than 
anticoagulation, filtration, packaging, and labeling in preparation for transportation, shall be 
performed by the collection center.  Processing of bone marrow for reduction of volume, plasma, 
red blood cells, or fat, including labeling or re -labeling, may be performed by the transplant 
center.  No additional product manipulation (i.e., T cell depletion, CD34+ cell selection, etc.) is 
allowed at the transplant center.  
 
Infusion of Bone Marrow  - Day 0 will be the day of marrow infusion.  Premedications for 
marrow infusion, as well as infusion rates and use of diuretics to prevent fluid overload will be 
dictated by local institutional practice.  The marrow should be infused as soon as possible after 
arrival at the Transplant Center.  If infusion occurs over 2 days, Day 0 will be the day infusion is 
completed.  
 
2.3.3.  GVHD Prophylaxis  
 
GVHD prophylaxis will consist of cyclosporine (CSA) 3 mg/kg/day by continuous infusion 
beginning at least 12 hours prior to marrow infusion (to be switched to oral administration as 
soon as clinically feasible).  Oral loading of CSA will be allowed.  CSA dose adjustments for 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Aplastic Anemia –  Protocol 0301  
  Version 9.0 dat ed June 6, 2013  
 
 
1-5 pediatric patients are allowed as per local institutional practice, provided a therapeutic serum level is achieved.  An intermittent CSA infusion schedule is also acceptable if dictated by local 
institutiona l practice.  
 
The intravenous and oral dose should be titrated to maintain a serum level of  
200-400 ng/mL.  Oral CSA should be continued for a minimum of nine months after transplant 
and then tapered as per institutional practice.  Patients will also receive methotrexate (MTX) at 
the dose of 10 mg/m
2 IV on Day 1, 3, 6 and 11.  MTX dose reductions should be made for renal , 
hepatic and mucosal toxicity, and leucovorin rescue is allowed according to local institutional 
practice.  MTX levels should preferably be monitored 24-72 hours after administration in 
patients with renal dysfunction.  In the event of CSA intolerance or local institutional preference, 
tacrolimus may be substituted for CSA, with a recommended starting dose of 0.015-0.030 
mg/kg/day intravenously and targeting a serum level of 5-15 ng/mL.  Alemtuzumab (Campath-
1H) is not allowed for GVHD prophylaxis, in view  of its known impact on engraftment and post -
transplant chimerism.  
 
2.3.4.  EBV Monitoring 
 
Patients will have EBV DNA quantitative PCR testing on peripheral blood at least every two to 
four weeks beginning at engraftment through Day 90-100.  Rituximab (375 mg/m2 intravenously 
x 1) will be administered whenever an EBV DNA level of 1000 copies/mL or higher is detected on two consecutive occasions.  In the event of persistent EBV viremia or signs/symptoms 
consistent with EBV -related PTLPD (adenopathy, fever, etc.) d espite rituximab administration, 
patients will be treated according to institutional protocols.  Institutions employing real -time 
PCR for EBV DNA monitoring will determine the threshold for rituximab treatment according to 
the local sensitivity and specifi city of the test.  
 
2.4. Supportive Care  
 
All patients will receive supportive care (prophylactic antibiotics/antifungals, menstrual 
suppression, empiric antibiotics, intravenous immunogloblin, red cell and/or platelet 
transfusions, hyperalimentation, CMV monitoring, etc.) according to local institutional practices.  
 
Transfusion thresholds and practice for blood product support will be in keeping with local 
institutional practice.  All blood products will be irradiated in accordance with local institutional 
pract ice.   
 
Growth factor (rhG -CSF, rhGM -CSF) administration will be allowed according to local 
institutiona l practice.  
 
2.5. Management of Graft Failure  
 Patients experiencing primary or secondary graft failure (see Sections 3.1 and 3.2 for definitions) 
will be ma naged according to local institutional practices and will be eligible to receive a second 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Aplastic Anemia –  Protocol 0301  
  Version 9.0 dat ed June 6, 2013  
 
 
1-6 allograft from the original or a different donor.  Preparative regimen and stem cell source will be dictated by local institutional practice.  
 
2.6. Management of ATG Intol e rance  
 
Patients experiencing a new, severe or life-threatening reaction to ATG and therefore unable or 
unwilling to receive the full planned cumulative dose of ATG (rabbit or horse product) will 
continue to be evaluated for the Phase I and II portion of t he study (see below).  Their 
conditioning regimen will then be altered as per local institutional preference or practice.  
 
2.7. Therapy Toxicities  
 
Toxicities will be graded using the NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 as w ell as the Bearman toxicity criteria.  The Bearman toxicity grading 
scales are included in the protocol as Appendix A.  All of the agents employed by this study are 
commercially available.

2-1 CHAPTER 3 
 
 3. STUDY ENDPOINTS AND DEFINITIONS  
 3.1. Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is selection of the optimal CY dose based on Day 100 assessments of graft 
failure (primary and secondary), regimen-related toxicity and early death.  
 
3.1.1.  Graft Failure  
 
Neutrophil engraftment is defined as the achievement of an ANC ≥ 0.5 x 10
9/L for three 
consecutive measurements on different days.  Primary graft failure is defined by the lack of 
neutrophil engraftment; i.e., ANC < 0.5 x 109/L measured for three consecuti ve measurements 
on different days by 100 days post -transplant.  Secondary graft failure, as defined in Section 
3.2.1, prior to Day 100 post -transplant will count towards the graft failure endpoint.  
 3.1.2.  Regimen -related Toxicity (RRT)  
 
RRT will be scored accor ding to the Bearman scale
34 (see Appendix A).  Major RRT is defined 
as severity of grade 4 in any organ system or grade 3 for pulmonary, cardiac, renal, oral mucosal 
or hepatic, in keeping with the approach adopted in FHCRC Protocol #800.  The assessment for 
RRT will be carried out weekly until Day 100 post -transplant.  The NCI’s CTCAE version 3.0 
will be used to supplement the Bearman toxicity criteria.  
 
3.1.3.  Early Death  
 
This endpoint is defined as death prior to Day 100 post -transplant.  
 
3.2. Secondary Endpoints  
 
3.2.1.  Post-transplant Survival  
 
Post-transplant survival is defined as time from transplant to death from any cause.  Patients 
alive at the time of last observation, for statistical purposes, will have a survival time which is 
censored.  
 
3.2.2.  Secondary Graft Failure  
 
Secondary graft failure is defined (in patients surviving at least 100 days) by initial neutrophil 
engraftment followed by subsequent decline in the ANC to < 0.5 x 109/L for 3 consecutive 
measurements on different days, unresponsive to growth factor therapy.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Aplastic Anemia –  Protocol 0301  
  Version 9.0 dat ed June 6, 2013  
 
 
2-2 3.2.3.  Acute GVHD of Grades 2 -4 and 3-4  
 
Acute GVHD is graded according to the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network 
(BMT CTN) Manual of Procedures (MOP).  The first day of acute GVHD onset at a certain 
grade will be used to calculate cumulative incidence curves for that GVHD grade (e.g., if the 
onset of grade 1 acute GVHD is on Day 19 post -transplant and onset of grade 3 is on Day 70 
post-transplant, time to grade 3 is Day 70).  This endpoint will be evaluated through 100 days.  
 3.2.4.  Chronic GVHD  
 
Chronic GVHD is scored according to the BMT CTN MOP.  The first day of chronic GVHD 
onset will be used to calculate cumulative incidence curves.

 4. EVALUATION AND ENROL LMENT 
 4.1. Enrollment Procedures  
 
Patients will be registered using the BMT CTN Ele ctronic Data Capture System 
(AdvantageEDC
SM).  The following procedures should be followed:  
1. The coordinator must contact the DCC/EMMES as soon as a potential patient is 
identified.  Enrollment may be on hold until the evaluation of the 100-Day outcomes for  
regimen -related toxicities, early deaths and graft retention of prior patients is complete.  
However, it may be possible to enroll the patient on the lowest of other available 
previously tested doses in Phase I or the best of other available doses in Phas e II.  The 
final decision about waiting versus treating the patient on another dose or off study will 
be made at the local transplant center level.  
2. All enrollments must be pre -approved by the DCC/EMMES.  Prior to initiation of the 
conditioning regimen, an authorized user at the transplant center completes the 
Demographics Form and the Segment A Enrollment Form in AdvantageEDC.  The 
eligibility screening (Segment A) includes a question confirming that the patient signed the informed consent form.  
3. If the pati ent is eligible, a study number and treatment dose assignment are generated on 
the “Enrollment Successful” page.  This page should be printed immediately as it is the 
only opportunity to do such.  A copy should be forwarded to the pharmacy to ensure the 
appropriate regimen is employed and a copy should be filed in the patient’s research file.  
4. A visit schedule based on transplant date is displayed for printing and is referred to as ‘Segment A Follow -up.’ 
 4.2. Study Monitoring  
 
4.2.1.  Follow -up Schedule  
 
The Follow -up S chedule for scheduled study visits is outlined in Table 4.2.1.  A detailed 
description of each of the forms and the procedures required for forms completion and 
submission can be found in the Data Management Handbook and User’s Guide.

post-transplant unless otherwise specified.  
 
4.2.2.  Case Report Forms  
 
Crite ria for Forms Subm ission : Criteria for timeliness of submission for all study forms are 
detailed in the Data Management Handbook and User’s Guide.  Forms that are not entered into 
AdvantageEDC within the specified time will be considered delinquent.  A missing form will 
continue to be requested either until the form is entered into the AdvantageEDC and integrated 
into the Data Coordinating Center’s (DCC) master database, or until an exception is granted and entered into the Missing Form Exception File, as detailed in the Dat a Management Handbook.  
 
Reporting Patient Deaths:  Recipient death information must  be entered into AdvantageEDC 
within 24 business hours of knowledge of the patient’s death.  If the cause of death is unknown at that time, it need not be recorded at that ti me.  However, once the cause of death is 
determined, the form must be updated in AdvantageEDC.  
 
CIBMTR Data Reporting: Centers participating in BMT CTN trials must register pre - and 
post-transplant outcomes on all consecutive hematopoietic stem cell transplants done at their 
institution during their time of participation to the Center for International Blood and Marrow 
Transplant Research (CIBMTR).  Registration is done using procedures and forms of the Stem 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Aplastic Anemia –  Protocol 0301  
  Version 9.0 dat ed June 6, 2013  
 
 
3-3 Cell Transplant Outc omes Database (SCTOD).  (Note : Federal legislation requires submission of 
these forms for all US allotransplant recipients.)  Enrollment on BMT CTN #0602 must be 
indicated on the SCTOD pretransplant registration form, if applicable.  Additionally, CIBMTR 
pre- and post -transplant Repor t Forms must also be submitted for all patients enrolled on this 
trial.  CIBMTR forms will be submitted directly to the CIBMTR at the times specified on the 
Form Submission Schedule.  Patients not undergoing HCT are not required to have their 
information r eported to the CIBMTR.  
 
Weekly GVHD Monitoring :  GVHD should be monitored in accordance with BMT CTN 
guidelines as specified in the Manual of Procedures.  Patients should be assessed weekly until 
Day 100 post -transplant for GVHD.  After Day 100 patients wi ll be assessed at each follow -up 
visit (Day 120, 180, 365 and 730) for the presence of GVHD.  For scheduling, a target day range 
has been provided in Table 4.2.1.  
 
4.2.3.  Adverse Event Reporting 
 
Unexpected, grade 3-5 adverse events (AE) will be reported through an expedited AE reporting 
system via AdvantageEDC .  Unexpected, grade 4-5 AEs must be reported within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event.  Unexpected, grade 3 AEs must be reported within three business days of knowledge of the event.  NCI’s CTCAE Version 3.0 should be used to describe events.  
Expected adverse events will be reported using NCI’s CTCAE Version 3.0 at regular intervals as defined on the Form Submission Schedule.  
 4.2.4.   Patient Evaluations  
 
4.2.4.1. Pre-transplant evaluations  
 
The following observations should be determined within six weeks prior to the initiation of the 
preparative regimen, unless otherwise specified:

 5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 5.1. Study Rationale  
 
A TBI de -escalation trial, FCHRC #800, conducted by Deeg et al.
10 recently showed that 
reducing the intensity of TBI to 200 cGy in a preparative regimen which included cyclophosphamide (CY) (200 mg/kg) and ATG (90 mg/kg) minimized TBI -related 
complications while preserving the beneficial effect of TBI on engraftment.  However, high dose 
CY (200 mg/kg) leads to substantial morbidity and mortality.  The current study will modify the 
regimen used in the Deeg et al.
10 study by adding fludarabine for four days and searching for the 
optimal dose of CY in a range from 0 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg.  
 
5.2. Obj ectives  
 
The purpose of this  study is to continue to optimize conditioning regimens in high-risk patients 
with severe aplastic anemia transplanted with marrow from HLA -compatible unrelated donors.  
Specifically, the study will address whether the addition of fludarabine to the condit ioning 
regimen of Deeg et al.10 will permit reduction in the CY dose to a point where survival is 
maintained or improved and sustained hematopoietic engraftment is maintained or improved 
with reduced major regimen-related toxicity (RRT) and/or early death.  
 5.3. Study Design Synopsis  
 The study is a prospective single -arm Phase I/II dose -selection and evaluation study.  The study 
will seek the optimal dose level of CY from among those shown in Table 5.3 based on 
assessments of graft failure, toxicity and early death during 100 days of follow -up post -
transplant.  Graft failure is defined in Section 3.1.1, regimen-related toxicity in Section 3.1.2, and 
early death in Section 3.1.3.  Details of the dose selection algorithm are given in the technical 
appendix (Section 5.11) below.  A brief synopsis is given below.  
 Phase I –  Test Each Dose for Adequate Safety and Graft Retention  
 
1. Proceed from the highest dose (150 mg/kg CY) to the lowest dose (0 mg/kg CY), 
treating a minimum of six patients at each dose.  
2. Evaluate the 100-Day outcomes for toxicity, death and graft failure on each patient 
enrolled at the current dose, or until stopping criteria are met.  
3. If there are three or more graft failures at the current dose, the current dose and all 
lower doses are closed to further enrollment.   
4. If there are five or more severe regimen -related toxicities and/or early deaths at the 
current dose, the current dose is closed to further enrollment, and the next lower dose is tested.

  Version 9.0 dated June 6, 2013  
 
 
4-2 5. Dose de -escalation ceases once all four doses are t ested or closed to further 
enrollment.  
 
Phase II –  Refine Dose Selection and Allocate Patients to the Optimal Dose 
 
1. Treat each newly enrolled patient at the most desirable of the dose levels remaining 
open to enrollment.  This can involve de -escalation, es calation, or no change in dose.  
2. As each patient completes the observation period, evaluate the 100-Day outcomes for 
graft failure, toxicity and/or early death for this patient, or until stopping criteria are met. 
3. If there are excess (according to the criteria in Table 5.8) graft failures, that patient's 
dose and all lower doses are closed to further enrollment.  
4. If there are excess (according to the criteria in Table 5.8) toxicities and/or early 
deaths, that patient's dose is closed to further enrollment.  
5. Re-evaluate the desirability of the current dose level based on the 100-Day outcomes 
for toxicity and/or early death and graft failure.   
6. Repeat steps 1 -5 until 54 patients are enrolled in Phase II, or all dose levels are closed 
to further enrollment.  
 
Phas e I consists of de -escalating through the doses, testing each one to ensure that toxicity and/or 
early death and graft failure rates are within acceptable parameters.  The patient can be put on the 
currently tested dose level even if some patients previous ly enrolled to that dose level have not 
completed their 100-Day observation period, as long as their unobserved outcomes cannot 
trigger the 100-d ay safety stopping rule.  If the new patient cannot be enrolled to the currently 
tested dose, the patient may be treated at the lowest of other available previously tested doses.  Note that since the study de -escalates through dose levels, previously tested dose levels are 
higher, and presumably have less risk of graft failure.  It is anticipated that Phase I will have 
between 24-27 subjects enrolled, assuming that the lowest dose level is reached, and an additional 3 subjects are enrolled to a previous dose level.   
 
Phase II allocates 70 additional patients to the optimal dose, bringing the maximum sample size 
to 94 in total.  Adaptive Bayesian criteria described in the technical appendix (Section 5.11) are 
used to rank the desirability of doses, and rankings can change as data accumulates, refining the 
selection of optimal dose made at the end of the Phase I porti on of the study.  A new patient can 
be put on the best dose even if some patients previously enrolled to that dose level have not 
completed their 100-d ay observation period, as long as their unobserved outcomes cannot trigger 
the 42-d ay safety stopping rul e.  If the number of graft failure in the cohort before Day 42 
exceeds the Day 42 boundary, enrollment to the cohort is temporarily suspended while waiting 
for Day 100 results.  If the number of graft failures exceeds the 100 Day boundary, enrollment to 
the cohort is permanently halted.

5.4. Accru al 
 
A maximum of 94 patients, up to 65 years of age with severe aplastic anemia who do not have an 
HLA -matched related donor, will be enrolled and followed for 24 months post -transplant.  
Recent NMDP data (Confer D, personal communication, 2004) indicate t hat in 2002, 2003 and 
2004 the NMDP has facilitated a total of 30, 44 and 48 matched, unrelated donor transplants for 
aplastic anemia, respectively.  While not all such patients would be captured in this study, these figures suggest that the enrollment por tion of the study could be completed in eight years.  
 
5.5. Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is the selection of the optimal CY dose  based on assessments of graft 
failure (primary or secondary), toxicity and early death during 100 days of follow -up post -
transplant.  
 
5.6. Primary Objective  
 
The primary objective is that with high probability, the optimal CY dose group will be selected 
by the dose -finding algorithm.   
 
5.7. Power Considerations  
 
The power for selecting the optimal dose, as computed via simulation, is given in Table 5.7.B 
corresponding to hypothetical scenarios in Table 5.7.A.  Simulations are based on the maximum 
sample size of 81 subjects.  
 
In scenarios A through I in Table 5.7.A, different probabilities of major toxicity (including early death) and engraftment, respectively, were assumed for various CY dose levels.  The optimal 
dose level probabilities are given in bold italics.  Refer to the technical appendix (Section 5.11) 
for the optimality criteria.  These scenarios were then used to estimate the probabilities with 
which a certain dose level would be chosen by the CY dose finding scheme (Table 5.7.B).  The operating characteristics of the design shown in Table 5.7.B were obtained from 10,000 
simulated trials.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Aplastic Anemia –  Protocol 0301  
  Version 9.0 dated June 6, 2013  
 
 
4-4 In scenarios A -D in Table 5.7.B, the a lgorithm selects the optimal dose with probability ranging 
from 0.76 to 0.80.  If we define an “acceptable dose” as one with engraftment probability at least 
0.80 and toxicity probability less than 0.40, the probability of selecting an acceptable dose ranges 
from 0.84 to 0.95.  Scenarios E through I correspond to situations in which the trial should stop 
early.  In scenario E there is no acceptable dose, and the algorithm almost always stops without finding a dose, on average after treating only 21 patients .  In scenario F, the top three doses 
increasingly exceed the acceptable toxicity level of 0.30.  However, given the increasing 
probabilities of engraftment at the higher doses, the dose -finding algorithm preferentially selects 
the higher doses.  Scenario G is the most challenging to handle since the toxicity probabilities are 
all well below the 0.40 toxicity threshold, and the third dose’s engraftment probability is quite 
close to the 0.20 graft failure threshold.  Nonetheless, the trial is stopped early a lmost 73% of the 
time.  In the remaining 27% of trials that are not stopped early, the third dose is almost always 
selected.  Scenarios H and I are similar to G; however, the lower efficacy probabilities result in earlier trial stopping.

5.8. Stopping Guidelines for Safety Monitoring  
 
Since this is a single -arm study (i.e.,  there is no patient randomization involved), the study will 
not stop early for efficacy.  Safety monitoring has two objectives:   
1. Minimize the number of patients who are put on a dose whose probability of graft failure 
and/or fatality without graft failur e is too high.  
2. Maximize the number of patients who are treated at the acceptable dose with the best 
levels of toxicity and efficacy (criteria are detailed in Section 5.11).  
 
Objective 1 is  accomplished through the stopping guideline in Table 5.8.A .  Table 5.8.A  
specifies the guideline by which a dose would be declared “unacceptable” with respect to the 
composite endpoint  or graft failure and/or fatality without graft failure by Day 100.  Objective 2 
is accomplished by evaluating dose desirability using engr aftment -toxicity trade -off contours.  
The motivation for the guidelines is Bayesian and is discussed further in the technical appendix.  
 
A new patient can be put on the optimal dose even if some patients already enrolled to that dose 
have not completed the ir 100-day observation period, as long as their unobserved outcomes 
cannot trigger the 42-day pausing guideline in Table 5. 8.B.   
 
After 29 subjects had been enrolled to the current trial, both the 150 mg/kg and the 0 mg/kg 
doses were closed due to excess toxicity and excess graft failure, respectively.  It was determined 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Aplastic Anemia –  Protocol 0301  
  Version 9.0 dated June 6, 2013  
 
 
4-6 that the next cohort of six subjects will be allocated to the 100 mg/kg dose level.  The stopping 
guideline for the composite endpoint was not met after six subjects were enrolled to the 100 
mg/kg dose level, the DSMB  was consulted to discuss how additional subjects should be 
allocated (i.e., to the 100 mg/kg or the 50 mg/kg dose ).  To aid this decision making, the 
Bayesian posterior probability calculations of graft failures and fatalities  without graft failure 
were provided.   While the 100 mg/kg dose level is currently the most optimal dose, the 50 mg/kg 
dose is very close to the 100 mg/kg dose in desirability.  The DSMB endorsed the proposal to 
allocate additional subjects in parallel to both the 100 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg dose levels under 
separate but parallel tracks covered by the current stopping guideline for the composite endpoint.  
Accrual at these two dose levels will be allowed to continue until the stopping guidelines are 
individuall y met or the data as a whole will trigger a formal DSMB review.  
 Monitoring of key safety endpoints will be conducted weekly, and if rates significantly exceed 
pre-set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that the DSMB can be advised.  Policies 
and composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN’s Manual of Procedures.

 5.9. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all patients.  Characteristi cs to 
be examined are: age, gender, race/ethnicity, performance status, HLA match, disease stage, 
serum bilirubin level, serum creatinine level, donor age, donor gender, and donor ethnicity.  
 
5.10. Secondary Endpoints and Analysis Plan 
 
The secondary endpoints discussed in this section will be analyzed for the optimal CY dose 
group.  
 
Post-Transplant Survival  
 
The event analyzed is the time from transplant to death from any cause.  Patients alive at the time 
of last observation will, for statistical purposes, have  a survival time, which is censored.  The 24-
month probability of survival and corresponding 95% confidence interval will be calculated 
using the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator.   
 
Graft Failure  
 Secondary graft failure will be analyzed.  In addition, the cumulative incidence of patients with 
primary or secondary graft failure, with death as a competing risk, will be estimated.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Aplastic Anemia –  Protocol 0301  
  Version 9.0 dated June 6, 2013  
 
 
4-8 Time to Acute GVHD  
 
To assess the incidence and severity of grades 2-4 and 3-4 acute GVHD from day of transplant, 
the first  day of acute GVHD onset at a certain grade will be used to calculate a cumulative 
incidence curve for that acute GVHD grade.  An overall cumulative incidence curve will be 
computed along with a 95% confidence interval at 100 days post -transplant with deat h 
considered as a competing risk.  
 
Time to Chronic GVHD  
 
To assess the incidence and severity of chronic GVHD from day of transplant, a cumulative 
incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% confidence interval at two years post -
transplant.  Death wi ll be considered a competing risk.  
 
 
5.11. Technical Appendix –  Bayesian Dose -selection Methodology  
 
Overview  
 The dose selection method is motivated by the approach of Thall and Cook (2004, Biometrics  60, 
684-693).  The dose -finding algorithm is initialized by specifying beta prior distributions for the 
respective engraftment and fatality without graft failure  rates at each CY dose level.  After each 
cohort of patients is enrolled and followed, the observed endpoint data from the cohort is used to update the pos terior distributions for the engraftment and fatality without graft failure rates of the 
dose that the cohort received.    
The stopping rule for the composite endpoint of graft failure and/or fatality without graft failure 
(Table 5.8A ) defines a  candidate set of doses that are still open for enrollment.  If there are 
untried doses in the candidate set, the next cohort will receive the dose level immediately below the current dose.  If all of the candidate doses have been tested, the next cohort’s dose will be the 
“most desirable” dose as defined below.  
 
Bayesian Motivation for the Stopping Guideline in Table 5.8 A  
 
The 100-day stopping rule for the composite endpoint of graft failure and/or fatality without graft 
failure states that a dose is unacceptable if  there is sufficient evidence to suggest a  composite  
event rate (i.e., graft failure rate or fatality without graft failure rate) greater than 20%.  
 
To construct the guideline, we computed the minimum number of events  in, respectively, x  = 6, 
12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78 patients which would correspond to Pr{ π F  > 0.2 | 
number of  events in x patients } > 0.7 
 Here, π
F is assumed to have a beta (0.6, 5.4) prior distribution.  This distribution has mean 0.1 
and has the weight of six “prior ” patients.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Aplastic Anemia –  Protocol 0301  
  Version 9.0 dated June 6, 2013  
 
 
4-9 The Day 42 pausing guideline (see Table 5.8.B) was motivated by the fact that we anticipate that roughly half of the events in the first 100 days will occur before Day 42 and half after.  This 
assumption is supported by the experience in the P hase I portion of this protocol, and is 
consistent with CIBMTR data.    
 
Thall’s and Cook’s Dose -desirability Method  
 
We use Thall’s and Cook’s dose -desirability method which is based on Bayesian and geometric 
methodology.  There are three steps needed to i mplement this method:  
1. Specify the maximum number of patients to be enrolled (78) and the cohort size (6).  
2. Specify dose -specific prior distributions for engraftment and fatality without graft failure, 
respectively.  
3. Construct a dose -desirability engraftment -fatality without graft failure trade -off contour.  
 
For Step 1, the cohort size refers to the number of patients we plan to put on a dose before 
possibly changing the dose.  Note that enrollment to a cohort will be stopped prematurely if the 
stopping guideline for the composite endpoint is met.   The total sample size and cohort size were 
dictated in part by the logistical constraints of operating a multi -center study in a rare disease, 
and in part by the statistical power to select the optimal dose, as shown in Tables 5.7.A and 
5.7.B.  
 For Step 2, we hypothesized for the four CY doses prior mean probabilities of engraftment of 
(0.70, 0.80, 0.90 and 0.95) and for fatality without graft failure of (0.05, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.30).  
See Table 5.11.  Note that the distribution is symmetric, giving each outcome equal impact on 
dose desirability calculations.  Assigning the weight of three “prior” patients to each prior mean, 
we obtained the following beta prior distributions:

1 = 50 mg/kg CY  0.80 (2.4, 0.6)  0.10 (0.3, 2.7)  
2 = 100 mg/kg CY  0.90 (2.7, 0.3)  0.20 (0.6, 2.4)  
3 = 150 mg/kg CY  0.95 (2.85, 0.15)  0.30 (0.9, 2.1)  
 For Step 3, we specified the engraftment -fatality without graft failure trade -off as follows: First, 
we selected 0.80 as the smallest engraftment rate that would be considered acceptable if the 
fatality without graft failure rate were 0.  Next, we selected 0.20 as the largest acceptable fatality 
without graft failure rate if the engraftment rate were 1.0 (i.e., engraftment always occurs).  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Aplastic Anemia –  Protocol 0301  
  Version 9.0 dated June 6, 2013  
 
 
4-10 Lastly, we selected (0.90, 0.10) as an intermediate point on the acceptable engraftment -fatality 
without graft failure trade -off contour.  Using Thall’s and Cook’s EffTox Version 2.10 software, 
we obtained the trade -off contour pict ured in Figure 5.11 .  
 
 
Figure 5.1 1 – Efficacy -Toxicity Trade -off Contours for Trial  
 
 
The “desirability” of a dose is defined on p.687 of Thall and Cook (2004) in terms of the dose’s 
posterior means of engraftment and fatality without graft failure corre sponding to the prior 
distributions from Step 2 and the trade -off contour from Step 3.   Specifically, let:  
 
q = the ordered pair of posterior means of engraftment and toxicity conditional on the observed 
data and prior distributions  
 
C = trade -off contour  
p = C  _ {the straight line through q and (1,0)}  
 
ρ(q) = Euclidean distance from q to (1,0)  
 ρ(p) = Euclidean distance from p to (1,0)  
 
Then the desirability  of dose x  is {ρ(p)/ρ(q)} – 1.  Note that all doses on the same contour line in 
Figure 5.12 have t he same desirability, and desirability of a dose increases as we move towards 
the (1,0) corner of the graph depicting perfect engraftment and no fatalities without graft failure.

Introduction 
This is a clinical trial, which is a research study designed to answer specific medical questions.  
The information from this study may or may not help you to overcome your disease.  It may help 
future patients.  The investigator/physician responsible for the study at your institution will 
explain the clinical trial to you and will answer the questions you may have.  Clinical trials include only people who choose to join the study.  
 
Please take your time to decide if you want to join this study.  Some people find it helpful to talk 
about the study with their family and friends before they make a decision.  It may also be useful to talk with your doctor and other people on your health care team  about the study.  If you have 
questions or want to know more about the study, you can ask them for more information.  
 You are being asked to take part in this study because you have Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA).  An allogeneic bone marrow transplant can be used to treat SAA.  An allogeneic marrow 
transplant is when marrow cells from another person are collected and are infused in your body.  
The donated cells can come from a related or unrelated donor.  Donated cells should match your 
cells as closely as p ossible.  You do not have a matched related donor therefore you will need to 
receive cells from a matched, unrelated donor.  
 Before you decide whether or not to join the study, please read the information below.  Feel free to ask questions to understand your rights and protections.  Participating in this study is your choice.  If you decide not to be in this study, you and your doctor will discuss other treatment 
options.

 Page 2 of 16 Patient Initials _________  Why is this study being done?  
Your bone marrow produces white cells, red cells and pla telets.  The cells produced in the bone 
marrow move into your blood stream.   Aplastic anemia is a blood disorder where the bone 
marrow has stopped working and produces very few or no cells to be released into the 
bloodstream.   If not successfully treated, this condition will almost always lead to death, 
primarily because of infection or bleeding.  A bone marrow transplant is an option for you 
because your doctors believe it may cure your aplastic anemia.  As you do not have a matched, related donor, a match ed, unrelated donor (i.e., not a blood relative) has been selected for you.  
Before you receive a matched, unrelated donor marrow transplant, you will receive medications and radiation to kill immune cells in your body that might reject the cells from your  donor.  This 
will allow your body to accept the donor marrow.  This is called engraftment.  The purpose of 
this study is to determine what dose of cyclophosphamide (a medication used to reduce your 
diseased cells and lower your immune system to allow your  body to accept the donor marrow 
cells) should be used along with other pre transplant medications to improve safety and outcomes 
of transplantation.  The purpose includes trying to reduce the risks and complications of the 
transplant while still allowing the donor marrow cells to replace the diseased marrow cells.   
 
 
How many people will take part in the study?  
As many as 94 patients will take part in this study at different hospitals in the United States.  
 
 
What will happen if I take part in this resear ch study?  
Before you begin the study — You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to 
find out if you can be in the study.  These tests are a normal part of transplantation procedure and would be done even if you did not join the study.  If you have had some of them recently, they may 
not need to be done again.  This will be up to your study doctor .  The tests include:  
 Medical history  
 Physical examination, including height and weight  
 Blood tests  
 Urine tests  
 Heart function tests  
 Lung tests , including a Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) or pulse oxymetry for pediatric 
patients  
 Bone marrow biopsies and aspirates  
 If you are a woman able to have children, a serum pregnancy test will also be performed.  
If you are pregnant, you will not be able to t ake part in this study.  
 
During the study  — If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, you will 
receive a matched, unrelated bone marrow transplant.  Before the transplant, you will be given medications and radiation to allow your body to accept your donor’s stem cells.  This is called the 
conditioning regimen.  Prior to your transplant a catheter (i.e., a soft plastic tube)  will be inserted 
into a vein under the collarbone  to allow for medications and fluids to be given.

Conditi oning regimen  — The conditioning regimen is used to kill the cells in your body that may 
reject the donor cells.  The drugs to be used in this clinical trial are fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, 
and antithymocyte globulin (ATG), as well as low -dose total body radiation.  All patients in this 
study will receive the same amount of fludarabine, ATG and low -dose total body radiation.  You 
will receive fludarabine on the fifth, fourth, third and second days before your transplant by 
intravenous infusion (through your vein).  You will receive ATG on the fourth, third, and second 
days before your transplant.  ATG is an animal serum, and your study doctor may decide to employ 
a horse or a rabbit product.  Both products have similar side effects and efficacy. You will receive 
total body radiation on the day before your transplant.  Different groups of patients will get 
different amounts of cyclophosphamide.  You will receive cyclophosphamide for a total of either 
one or two days before your transplant.  The number of da ys depends on your group.  Patients 
will be placed in the group that is being tested at that time.  Your doctor will tell you which group you are in.  Neither you nor your doctor can choose the group.  
 The main purpose of this study is to determine the be st dose of cyclophosphamide.  This means 
that small groups of patients are treated with a given dose of cyclophosphamide and followed 
closely until it can be determined that the new marrow has taken and the treatment has not 
caused any unacceptable harm.  The doctors who are conducting the study have by now gained 
some experience with this conditioning regimen, and this has helped them to narrow down the 
number of possible doses of cyclophosphamide that you, as a new patient, may receive.  You 
should be awa re that some patients who received three days of cyclophosphamide (i.e., the 
highest dose) suffered severe side effects (including death), and therefore, new patients are no 
longer being placed in this group.  You should also be aware that patients who rec eived zero 
days of cyclophosphamide (i.e. the lowest dose) experienced graft rejection (i.e., their body did 
not accept the new marrow, and the new cells failed to grow), therefore, new patients are no 
longer being assigned to this group.  Patients who now  come to transplantation will be treated 
with either one or two days of cyclophosphamide.  
 Reinfusion of stem cells (transplantation) — After the conditioning regimen, the donor 
marrow cells will be given to you through your catheter.  The cells will trave l into the 
bloodstream to reach your bone marrow where they are expected to make healthy, new blood 
cells.  This step is necessary to replace your diseased marrow and because the high dosages of 
drugs given to you during the conditioning regimen may also damage or destroy healthy cells in 
your bone marrow.  Until the new cells begin producing healthy blood cells, you will be at an increased risk of bleeding or developing an infection.  
 
Following the transplant, you will have the following standard tests and evaluations:  
• Medical history  
• Physical examination, including height and weight  
• Blood tests  
• Urine tests

 Page 4 of 16 Patient Initials _________  You will be expected to stay at the transplant center for at least three months after your 
transplant.  You will be asked to return to the transplant c enter for regular follow -up care.  The 
standard tests will be done at that time.  
 
 How long will I be in the study?  
You will be in the study for up to two years.  Follow -up for transplant will last as long as you 
require care.  However, we would like to ke ep track of your medical condition for the rest of your 
life by contacting you and the doctor providing your regular medical care by phone or mail once a 
year.  Keeping in touch with you and checking on your condition every year helps us look at the 
long-t erm effects of the study and transplantation in general.  Many transplant centers include this 
type of long-term follow -up as part of their regular medical care.  It is not necessary for you to agree 
to follow -up for longer than two years to participate in this study.  
 
 
Can I stop being in the study?  
Yes.  You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell your doctor if you are thinking about stopping or decide to stop.  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.  If you withdraw from the study, you 
will continue to have access to healthcare at [participating institution].  If you decide to withdraw, you should inform [the Principal Investigator] in writing.  It is important to tell your 
doctor if you are thinking about stopping so any risks from the medications ca n be evaluated.  
Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking about stopping is to discuss what follow -
up care and testing could be most helpful to you.  
 If you withdraw, there will be no penalty and you will not lose any benefits to which you are 
otherwise entitled.  You will be asked to return for a checkup.  
 
 
Can the Principal Investigator withdraw me from the study?  
You can be taken off the study (with or without your consent) for any of the following reasons:  
• You do not qualify to be in the study because you do not meet the study requirements.  Ask 
your doctor if you would like more information about this.  
• You need a medical treatment not allowed in this study.  
• Sometimes there may be a wait period for a new patient to be enrolled.  This may happen to 
you. 
• The investigator decides that continuing in the study would be harmful to you.  
• The study treatments have a bad effect on you.  
• You become pregnant and the study treatment could be harmful to the fetus.  
• You are unable to keep appointments or take study drugs as directed.  
• The study is cancelled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

If you withdraw, can information about you still be used and/or collected?  
If you withdraw from the study or your doctor withdraws you from the study, we ask that you agree 
that we can continue using all information about you that has already been collected as part of the 
study prior to your withdrawal and to continue to allow your doctor to tell us about your progress  
until 24 months after your transplant.  You may, of course, say “no.”  
 
 
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?  
Risks and toxicities related to bone marrow transplantation are described in detail below.  They 
include low blood counts, bleeding, infection and graft -vs-host disease (GVHD).  The risk of 
dying as a result of bone marrow transplantation is no less than 30%.  Everyone taking part in the 
study will be watched carefully for any side effects.  However, doctors don’t know a ll the side 
effects that may happen.  Your health care team may give you medicines to help lessen side 
effects.  In some cases, side effects can be serious, long -lasting, or may never go away.  
 
You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects t hat you have while taking part in the 
study.  
 
The following are side effects from the medications administered to help your body accept your 
donor’s marrow.  These side effects usually get better completely after you stop taking the drugs, 
but some permane nt or long-term problems, such as organ damage, may occur.

Are there benefits to taking part in the study?  
There may or may not be direct benefits to you from participating in this study.  We hope that 
information gathered in this trial will help future transplant patients.  
 
 What other choices do I have if I do not take part in the study?  
There is no agreement among doctors on whic h medications to give patients prior to a matched 
unrelated donor marrow transplant to allow the donor cells to replace the diseased marrow.  
Patients who do not receive a transplant are usually treated with a variety of immunosuppressive 
drugs (drugs aime d at weakening their immune system).  However, this care is not known to 
provide long-term control or cure of the disease.  Most patients preparing for transplantation

RISKS AND TOXICITIES  RELATED TO BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT  
 
 
There are certain risks related to a mar row transplant.  There are risks from the medications and 
irradiation therapy you will receive as part of the conditioning for the transplant and risks related to the transplant itself.  Most of these risks and side effects are listed below, but they will vary 
from person to person.  
 
Risks Related to the Transplant Procedure  
 
Cyclophosphamide  is a common medication used to treat cancer.  This medication kills cancer 
cells by stopping them from growing.  Cyclophosphamide may cause you to have  diarrhea (loose  
stools), nausea (feeling sick to your stomach), vomiting (throwing up) , short -term hair loss, 
short -term bladder problems, and, at times, bleeding from the bladder (blood in your urine).  A 
few patients may have bladder damage and bleeding for a longer ti me.  You will be given large 
amounts of a sterile solution through your central line to protect your bladder.  A bladder 
catheter (thin plastic tube) may be inserted into your bladder, if your physician thinks that it can 
help you.  C yclophosphamide slows the making of new blood cells.  This causes a risk of 
infection and/or severe bleeding until the transplanted donor cells begin to work in you.  You will get blood transfusions as needed.  Cyclophosphamide also lowers your immune (defense) system and as a result you may have more infections.  In a small number of patients, cyclophosphamide can damage the heart muscle causing the heart not to pump as well (heart 
failure).  If this occurs you may have shortness of breath and have fluids build-up in your body.   
Cyclophosphamide can damage the male (testes) or female (ovaries) sex glands.  In men, the 
number of sperm may be reduced but you would still be able to have intercourse.  Women who 
are still menstruating may have irregular periods or may no longer have any periods.  Whether 
you are a man or woman, this medication may decrease your chances of being able to have a 
child.  
 
Fludarabine  may cause confusion, seizures, coma, or peripheral nerve damage with pain.  It may 
also cause kidney, liver, and/or central  nervous system dysfunction.  
 
Antithymocyte globulin (ATG)  may cause skin rash, skin itching, joint pain, swelling, and/or 
fever.  Severe or life -threatening allergic reactions, including severe shortness of breath, throat 
swelling, and/or diarrhea may als o occur.  Some of these reactions can be life threatening or even 
fatal.  Antithymocyte globulin can cause bleeding.  ATG is an animal serum.  Your doctor may decide to employ a rabbit or a horse product.  The development of aggressive lymphomas (i.e., 
cancers of the immune system) has been reported in patients receiving ATG.  
 
Total body radiation  can cause skin redness, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heart or lung 
damage with scarring, or low blood counts.  If the bone marrow transplant that follows total body 
radiation is not successful, it will cause death.

 Page 14 of 16 Patient Initials _________  Cyclosporine and tacrolimus  may cause rash and/or liver and/or kidney damage.  These effects 
are temporary, and in most cases reversible.  Any or all of these complications can be severe, 
irrevers ible, and may lead to death.  They may cause tremors, confusion and seizures, and/or other 
blood-related effects that are reversible upon stopping the drug.  Rare, fatal cases of severe 
allergic reactions or the development of aggressive lymphomas have bee n reported in patients 
receiving cyclosporine and/or ATG or tacrolimus.  
 
Methotrexate  may cause mouth sores, rash, liver damage or kidney damage.  
 Graft re je ction  may occur.  Graft rejection means the infused donor cells fail to grow in the 
patient's body and are unable to produce new blood cells.  This can be a serious or life -
threatening complication.  
 Graf t versus host disease  (GVHD) is due to immune cells (i.e. lymphocytes) from the donor 
attacking the patient's organs.  The acute form of GVHD may cause redness of the skin, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or liver problems.  The chronic form of GVHD may cause dryness of the 
eyes and/or mouth, and/or breathing problems.  It may cause tightness and/or scarring of the skin, 
weight loss, diarrhea, and/or difficulty swallowing.  Either one of the forms of GVHD can range 
from mild to severe to life -threatening.  
 
Acute GVHD usually occurs within the first 100 days post -transplant.  Chronic GVHD usually 
occurs between 100 days and 1 year post -transplant and occ asionally greater than 1 year post -
transplant.  Using these drugs with other drugs could cause other side effects that are not seen 
when each drug is given alone.  If any doctor other than the Study doctor prescribes other drugs, 
the patient must tell the study nurse or doctor right away.  
 
The immune system is severely weakened for the first 6-12 months after transplantation and 
slowly improves over several years.  Unusual or late infections may occur because of this 
problem.  These infections occasionally lead to death.  
 
This research study may involve unpredictable risks to the participants . 
 
Central venous catheter  is a flexible sterile tube that can be placed into a large vein either 
under the collar bone or in your groin area so that blood can be withdrawn.  This tube is placed 
under local anesthesia.  Complications may include blood clots and infection.  Clotting may necessitate removal of the catheter or treatment of the clot by injecting a medicine that dissolves 
blood clots.  If you develop an infec tion, you will require treatment with antibiotics.  If the 
catheter is placed under the collarbone, other uncommon side effects may include swelling of the 
face and arm and/or lung collapse.  If the lung collapses, it may be necessary to place a tube betwe en the ribs to allow the lung to re -expand.  
 
Low White Cell Count: Your white cell count will remain low for at least 3 -4 weeks after 
receiving your new marrow.  Infections (for example, pneumonia) can occur and they can be 
severe or life -threatening.  The y can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi.

PATIENT CONSENT   IRB #   
 
 Page 15 of 16 Patient Initials _________  Bleeding:  Platelets help your blood to clot.  Your platelets will be low until the new bone 
marrow grows and, as a result, bleeding may occur.  This can be minor bleeding, such as 
nosebleeds or bruising, but more serious, life -threatening bleeding in the lungs, brain and other 
organs can occur if the platelet count remains low.  Usually, there is success in preventing major 
bleeding problems with transfusions of platelets.  However, some patients may not respond well 
to transfused platelets and may be at serious risk for bleeding.  
 Red Cell and/or Platelet Transfusions:  As part of this treatment you are expected to need red 
cell and/or platelet transfusions.  
 
Ve no -Occlusive Disease (VOD):  This can occur as a r esult of high dose chemotherapy, 
radiation therapy, or both.  Veno-occlusive causes severe damage to the liver.  Symptoms 
include jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), weight gain, and extra fluid build-up in the 
abdominal cavity and other parts of the body.  It can often be managed successfully, and 
completely resolved, but can potentially cause death.  
 
Mouth Sores and Diarrhea:  The chemotherapy and radiation cause irritation in the lining of the 
mouth and intestines.  This can result in painful mout h sores and diarrhea and you may need 
medication to help control the pain.  If your mouth sores are severe you may not be able to eat 
normally until the sores are healed.  Mouth sores get better when the white blood count starts to 
rise. 
 
Capillary Leak Syndrome:  This may occur as a result of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  
The blood vessels may become ‘leaky’ and fluid enters the abdominal cavity, lungs, and other 
tissues.  You may gain water weight and not go to the bathroom as often as you normally do.  
Capillary leak syndrome can be difficult to manage if extra fluid enters the lungs and causes 
difficulty breathing.  You may die if there is continued fluid collection in the lungs.  
 
Unexpected Organ Damage and Other Side Effects:  Although your major  organs function 
well, it is possible you may experience unexpected, life -threatening heart, lung, kidney, or liver 
damage as a result of the transplant.  Occasionally, the high doses of chemotherapy and radiation 
cause severe lung damage that cannot alway s be treated.  If this happens, you may need to use 
oxygen or even a respirator.  The lung damage can be life threatening.  Rarely, multi -organ 
failure (such as lung and kidney failure) may occur, which is often fatal.    Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpur a (Thrombotic Microangiopathy ): In this post -
transplant complication, chemotherapy and/or radiation produce damage to the lining of the 
blood vessels causing generalized clotting in the bloodstream.  These clots can choke the blood 
supply to some of the body organs and this can lead to brain and kidney damage, a drop in the platelet count, as well as high blood pressure.  This complication may be severe or life 
threatening and plasma exchange may be required.  
 
Late Effects : You may experience side effects t hat occur several months to many years after 
your transplant.  You may experience poor function of the thyroid gland, requiring you to take 
thyroid medication.  Symptoms of poor thyroid function include dry skin, constipation, fatigue,

 Page 16 of 16 Patient Initials _________  cold intolerance, we ight gain and poor appetite.  As a result of radiation, cataracts may occur 
earlier in life compared to a person who had not had a transplant.  If you develop cataracts they 
may require treatment.  It is rare, but your kidneys could be affected, causing anemia or high blood pressure.  There is also a risk you may develop cancer including leukemia as a result of the 
chemotherapy.  If secondary cancers occur they generally do not occur until 10 to 15 years after 
the transplant but can occur sometimes within f ive years after transplant.  The long-term effects 
upon heart, lung, and brain are unknown. 
 
 
Fluid Build -up: You will receive intravenous fluids during the transplant process and you may 
have difficulty eliminating this fluid.  Your doctor will use standa rd drugs to remove this fluid.  
This drug may cause hearing loss and loss of body chemicals such as potassium and sodium.  
This loss is temporary and reversible.  
  
Risk to the Unborn 
The treatment that you are undertaking has not been proven to be safe at any stage of pregnancy.  
Therefore, if you are pregnant or nursing, you are not eligible for this study.  Women who have 
the potential of becoming pregnant must use some form of effective birth control.   
 
 
Sterility and Future Childbearing Potential for M en and Women 
Chemotherapy and/or irradiation can impair or decrease fertility and may cause lasting effects on the reproductive potential of both men and women treated in this manner. The transplantation 
procedure may cause a decrease in sexual desire and function.  It should be emphasized that your 
cancer treatment/therapy may cause your menstrual periods to become irregular or cease 
altogether.  However, this DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU CANNOT BECOME PREGNANT, as the effect on fertility is usually not permanent or irreversible.  You must use birth control if 
you want to avoid becoming pregnant. 
 
 
 
Risks Related to the Infusion of Bone Marrow  
The stem cell infusion is given similar to a blood transfusion.  The infusion of  stem cells usually 
has few side effects .  Rarely the infusion may cause a headache, chest pain or trouble breathing, 
a slight fever, or blood in the urine.  You will be given pre -medications just prior to the infusion 
to decrease the risk of a reaction.  In rare instances, a severe allergic reaction can occur called anaphylaxis, which could cause a drop in blood pressure or extreme difficulty in breathing.  You will be monitored very closely.

LABORATORY PROCEDURES  
 
  
1. HLA TYPING  
 
Before Transplant ation:  HLA typing will be performed for all patients and donors in 
American Society of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics (ASHI) -approved laboratories 
designated by the transplant centers.  HLA typing must be performed by DNA methods for 
HLA -A, -B, and  -C at intermediate resolution, and DRB1 at high resolution, consistent with 
NMDP standard procedures.  HLA typing for DQ is recommended but not mandatory.  
 
After Transplantation:  High resolution HLA typing of cryopreserved patient and donor 
samples is con ducted as an ongoing research study by the NMDP.  Data will be shared with the 
BMT CTN.  
  2. CHIMERISM  
 
Samples of peripheral blood or marrow are collected from patient and donor pre -transplant for 
chimerism studies according to institutional standards.  P atient samples are also collected on Day 
28, 100 and 12 months post -transplant.  Chimerism results will be reported as “percent donor 
DNA.”  Chimerism should be determined by PCR -based methods (e.g., microsatellite 
polymorphism analysis or real -time PCR).  
  
3. PATHOLOGY /CYTOGENETICS STUDIES  
 A bone marrow biopsy/aspirate is required within 12 weeks prior to the initiation of conditioning 
therapy, and at Day 100 ± 30 days for all patients.  A bone marrow biopsy/aspirate is 
recommended but not required at 12 months ± 3 months post -transplant for all patients.  
Cytogenetics is required at Day 28, Day 100 and 12 months post transplant if patient -donor sex 
mismatch present.  Cytogenetics may be replaced by FISH (X/Y probe) on marrow or peripheral blood at similar  timepoints.  Pathology and cytogenetic studies will be conducted per 
institutional guidelines.  
 
 4. GRAFT CHARACTERIZATION 
 
Graft processing and characterization will be performed in keeping with the BMT CTN MOP 
and local institutional practice.  
 
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK    Aplastic Anem ia – Protocol 0301  
  Version 9.0 dated June 6, 2013  
 
 
C-3 5. IMMU NOGLOBULIN MONITORING  
 
Quantitative immunoglobulin levels including IgG, IgA and IgM are recommended, but not 
required, within six weeks prior to the initiation of the preparative regimen.  Testing will be done 
in keeping with the BMT CTN MOP and local ins titutional practice.  
 
 6. EPSTEIN -BARR VIRUS (EBV) SURVEILLANCE  
 
Epstein -Barr Virus (EBV) surveillance using a real time quantitative EBV DNA PCR plasma-
based assay will be performed at least every two to four weeks beginning at engraftment through Day 90-100, according to institutional standards.  Institutions employing real -time PCR for EBV 
DNA monitoring will determine the threshold for rituximab treatment according to the local sensitivity and specificity of the test.

HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
 
1. Patient Consent  
 
A conference will be held with the patient and family to discuss this study and alternative treatments available for the treatment of the underlying disease.  The Principal Investigator or 
another designated physician will conduct the conference.  All potential risks associated with the 
treatment should be discussed as objectively as possible.   
 The consent document should be reviewed with the patient and family prior to proceeding to 
transplant.  
 
Informed consent from the patient will be obtained using a form approved by the Institutional Review Board of the institution enrolling the patient.  
 
 2. Confidentiali ty 
 
Confidentiality will be maintained by individual names being masked and assigned a patient 
identifier code.  The code relaying the patient’s identity with the ID code will be kept separately 
at the center.  The ID code will be transmitted to the BMT CT N Data Coordinating Center upon 
enrollment.  
 
 3. Participation of Women and Minorities and Other Populations  
 
Women and ethnic minorities and other populations will be included in this study.  Accrual of 
women and minorities at each center will be monitored t o determine whether their rates of 
enrollment are reflective of the distribution of potentially eligible women and minorities 
expected from data reported to the CIBMTR and from published data on incidence of aplastic 
anemia in these groups.  Centers will be notified if their rates differ significantly from those 
expected and asked to develop appropriate recruitment strategies.

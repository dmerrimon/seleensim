Approximately 100 patients will be enrolled across 15 sites in the United States and Europe.\n\nINCLUSION CRITERIA:\n1. Male or female subjects ≥18 years of age\n2. Histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC\n3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1\n4. Adequate organ function as defined by laboratory values\n5. Life expectancy >12 weeks\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n1. Prior treatment with similar investigational agents\n2. Active brain metastases\n3. Pregnant or nursing women\n4. Severe cardiac dysfunction\n\nTREATMENT PLAN:\nDrug X will be administered orally at 200mg twice daily continuously in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nSAFETY MONITORING:\nSide effects will be assessed at each visit using CTCAE version 4.0. Serious adverse events must be reported within 24 hours. Regular monitoring will include complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and liver function tests.",

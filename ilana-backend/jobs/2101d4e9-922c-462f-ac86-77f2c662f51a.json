STUDY OBJECTIVES: Primary Objective: To assess the overall response rate (ORR) in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with Drug X. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), to assess overall survival (OS), to characterize the safety profile, and to evaluate quality of life measures. STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study. Approximately 100 patients will be enrolled across 15 sites in the United States and Europe. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Male or female subjects \u226518 years of age, histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1, adequate organ function as defined by laboratory values, and life expectancy >12 weeks. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Prior treatment with similar investigational agents, active brain metastases, pregnant or nursing women, and severe cardiac dysfunction. TREATMENT PLAN: Drug X will be administered orally at 200mg twice daily continuously in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. SAFETY MONITORING: Side effects will be assessed at each visit using CTCAE version 4.0. Serious adverse events must be reported within 24 hours.",

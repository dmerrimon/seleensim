    "text": "PROTOCOL TITLE: A Phase 2, Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Experimental Drug X in Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Primary Objective: To assess the overall response rate (ORR) in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with Drug X. Secondary Objectives: To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), to assess overall survival (OS), to characterize the safety profile, and to evaluate quality of life measures. STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study. Approximately 100 patients will be enrolled across 15 sites in the United States and Europe. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Male or female subjects \u226518 years of age, histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1, adequate organ function as defined by laboratory values, and life expectancy >12 weeks. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Prior treatment with similar investigational agents, active brain metastases, pregnant or nursing women, and severe cardiac dysfunction. TREATMENT PLAN: Drug X will be administered orally at 200mg twice daily continuously in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. SAFETY MONITORING: Side effects will be assessed at each visit using CTCAE version 4.0. Serious adverse events must be reported within 24 hours. Regular monitoring will include complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and liver function tests.",

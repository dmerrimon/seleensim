Intervention:\rIntravenous (IV) artesunate\rObjectives:\r\rPrimary:\rTo determine the relationship between dihydroartemisinin (DHA) exposures following intravenous dosing and markers of physiologic dysfunction associated with severe malaria and explore predictors that may affect this relationship\rSecondary:\rTo determine the relationship between DHA exposures and time to hospital discharge and explore predictors that may affect this relationship\rTo determine the relationship between DHA exposures and parasite clearance associated with treatment of severe malaria and explore predictors that may affect this relationship.\rExploratory:\rTo determine the relationship between DHA exposures and neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with treatment of severe malaria outcomes and explore predictors that may affect this relationship\u00a0\u00a0\rTo evaluate the role of parasite clearance as a mediator of the relationship between DHA exposures and markers of physiologic dysfunction associated with severe malaria\rTo develop a score comprised of markers of physiologic dysfunction and describe its relationship to clinical outcomes\rTo assess P. falciparum infections for artemisinin resistance\u00a0\rDescription of Study Design:\rThis clinical study is a phase 4, two-site, open-label pharmacokinetic study of intravenous (IV) artesunate in up to 100 Ugandan children 6 months-14 years of age who are diagnosed with severe malaria according to standardized World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (any P. falciparum parasitemia and the presence of danger signs). Participants will receive the standard of care IV artesunate for initial treatment of severe malaria per WHO guidelines: children weighing <20 kg should receive 5 doses of 3.0 mg/kg/dose compared to older children who should receive 2.4 mg/kg/dose, all at times 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours (WHO Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria. Third Edition. www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241549127/en/). Children who recover and are able to transition to oral antimalarial therapy will initiate a 3-day course of artemisinin-combination oral therapy per national guidelines. Biomarkers of physiologic dysfunction will be quantified at regular intervals, including serum lactate, serum glucose, total and direct bilirubin, acidosis, Blantyre coma score, and anemia. These biomarkers will be considered both independently and together as a weighted score to relate to the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite of IV artesunate, dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and to efficacy markers that more accurately reflect clinical outcomes. We will also quantify P. falciparum parasitemia using standardized thick blood smear and relate this outcome to DHA dose and exposure for comparison with historical studies.\rChildren 6 months to 14 years of age living in or near Tororo District, Uganda, who are diagnosed with severe malaria and who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. \rEstimated Time to Complete Enrollment:\r6 months\r\r\fSchematic of Study Design:\r\r\u00a0\rPrior to\u00a0\rEnrollment\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rStudy Day 1:\rEnrollment\r\rStudy Days 2-7:\u00a0\rFollow-up\r\rStudy Day 14:\rFollow-up\r\rStudy Day 28:\rFollow-up\r\rStudy Day 183:\rFinal Study Visit\r\r\r\r\r\rKey Roles\rIndividuals:\rDMID Clinical Project Manager:\u00a0\rWalt Jones, RN, MPH\rParasitology & International Programs Branch (HNM53)\rDivision of Microbiology & Infectious Diseases\rNational Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases\rNational Institutes of Health\rBG 5601FL RM 8A37\rMail Stop 9825\r5601 Fishers Lane\rBethesda, MD 20852\rPhone: 240-627-3283\rEmail: joneswalter@niaid.nih.gov\u00a0\r\r\rDMID Medical Officer:\u00a0\rGreg A.

It accounted for 99.7% of all malaria cases in the WHO African Region in 2018.\u00a0\r\rChildren younger than 5 years of age and pregnant women are most at risk of malaria and death. They accounted for 67% of the estimated 405,000 malaria deaths worldwide, with 94% of these in the African Region. Although there was an overall reduction in malaria deaths in 2018 compared with 2010, the malaria mortality reduction rate slowed since 2016 and this has malaria researchers questioning if current malaria treatment regimens are optimal and based on sound scientific evidence.\u00a0\r\rSevere malaria is a medical emergency with an immediate threat to life and so requires prompt treatment with effective therapy. The priority requirement for successful diagnosis and treatment is early recognition of the signs and symptoms of severe malaria that should lead to emergency care in an in-patient setting. Artemisinin derivatives are highly effective and rapidly schizonticidal drugs, devoid of major side-affects and their use does not warrant intensive monitoring. Large randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews demonstrated superiority of artesunate to quinine for treatment of severe malaria, with significant reduction in mortality and complications associated with malaria as well as less adverse effects. These trials provided support for parenteral artesunate to replace parenteral quinine as drug of first choice in treating severe malaria. Currently, the WHO recommends use of intravenous or intramuscular artesunate as first line treatment for severe malaria, administered for at least 24 hours, until the patient can tolerate oral medication and to complete treatment with at least 3 days of an ACT. In case of unavailability of artesunate, to use artemether in preference to quinine for treatment of severe malaria.\u00a0\r\rUganda adopted this policy for severe malaria treatment, however; parenteral artesunate is not widely available and effort to improve accessibility should be reinforced.\r\rSince 1991 and before April 2019, the only FDA-approved treatment for severe malaria in the U.S. was intravenous quinidine gluconate. Availability of quinidine gluconate in the U.S. has declined over the past 20 years, such that the last lot manufactured reached expiry in March 2019. A replacement essential medicine is needed in the U.S. for treatment of severe malaria. Intravenous (IV) artesunate is now the only option available for treatment in the United States, and is uniquely available through the CDC under an expanded access investigational new drug (IND) protocol via scattered distribution centers located near transportation hubs. Unfortunately, severe malaria can progress rapidly, and delays in delivery of IV artesunate from treatment distribution centers to patients with severe malaria may lead to complications, including treatment failure and death. To mitigate risk of severe malaria complications, pharmacologic treatment for severe malaria treatment should be optimized for patients with severe malaria.\u00a0\r\rMalaria treatment and Drug Pharmacokinetics\rSevere malaria is a medical emergency which if not immediately treated results in 100% mortality. It is fundamental that plasma concentrations of a highly effective antimalarial drug are achieved as rapidly as possible. Artesunate is a water soluble hemisuccinate artemisinin derivative; available as sodium hemisuccinate salt for injection (Guilin Pharmaceutical Factory, Guangxi, People\u2019s Republic of China). Artesunate\u2019s excellent antimalarial property demonstrated by rapid parasite clearance, is enhanced by its high initial maximum concentration (Cmax) and rapid hydrolysis to its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin. High plasma concentrations of artesunate and dihydroartemisinin are achieved within 5 minutes of drug administration and artesunate is rapidly cleared from circulation. The Cmax for both artesunate and dihydroartemisinin are observed rapidly post dose administration indicating rapid conversion of artesunate to dihydroartemisinin. Artesunate is cleared from circulation rapidly while dihydroartemisinin has a longer elimination half-life. Accurate measurement of plasma concentrations of artesunate and dihydroartemisinin should guide adequate dosing as well as facilitate differentiation of treatment failure due to inadequate drug exposure from failure due to drug resistance.\rRationale\rCurrent dosing regimens for IV artesunate are based on time to parasite clearance and not clinical endpoints related to physiologic changes that occur with parasitemia. Other measures of physiologic dysfunction can be used as study endpoints for a malaria treatment outcome analysis of current regimens for IV artesunate for severe malaria treatment. Improved dosing regimens will lead to fewer complications and likely fewer deaths. Such a strategy is needed to further reduce public health gains against malaria mortality that seem to have recently stalled.\r\rFor pediatric patients, IV artesunate dosing is weight-based to adjust for artesunate clearance and has been developed based on time to parasitemia clearance times, which may not completely reflect clinical cure. The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) 2015 guidelines state that children weighing <20 kg should receive 5 doses of 3.0 mg/kg/dose compared to older children and adults who should receive 2.4 mg/kg/dose, all at times 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours (WHO Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria. Third Edition. www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241549127/en/). The December 2016 CDC guidelines recommended 2.4 mg/kg/dose for all pediatric and adult patients, regardless of weight (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/artesunate/Artesunate_protocol_12_19_2016.pdf), while the recently updated October 2019 CDC guideline recommends the same weight-based dosing scheme as the WHO (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/Malaria_Treatment_Table_120419.pdf). A recent study of severe malaria in sub-Saharan African children documented equivalent time to parasite clearance using 2.4 mg/kg/dose at 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours; and a larger 4.0 mg/kg/dose at 0, 24 and 48 hours.\r\rP. falciparum parasites are known for their capacity to infect red blood cells that then display variant surface antigens that adhere to endothelial vasculature in target organs.

It accounted for 99.7% of all malaria cases in the WHO African Region in 2018.\u00a0\r\rChildren younger than 5 years of age and pregnant women are most at risk of malaria and death. They accounted for 67% of the estimated 405,000 malaria deaths worldwide, with 94% of these in the African Region. Although there was an overall reduction in malaria deaths in 2018 compared with 2010, the malaria mortality reduction rate slowed since 2016 and this has malaria researchers questioning if current malaria treatment regimens are optimal and based on sound scientific evidence.\u00a0\r\rSevere malaria is a medical emergency with an immediate threat to life and so requires prompt treatment with effective therapy. The priority requirement for successful diagnosis and treatment is early recognition of the signs and symptoms of severe malaria that should lead to emergency care in an in-patient setting. Artemisinin derivatives are highly effective and rapidly schizonticidal drugs, devoid of major side-affects and their use does not warrant intensive monitoring. Large randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews demonstrated superiority of artesunate to quinine for treatment of severe malaria, with significant reduction in mortality and complications associated with malaria as well as less adverse effects. These trials provided support for parenteral artesunate to replace parenteral quinine as drug of first choice in treating severe malaria. Currently, the WHO recommends use of intravenous or intramuscular artesunate as first line treatment for severe malaria, administered for at least 24 hours, until the patient can tolerate oral medication and to complete treatment with at least 3 days of an ACT. In case of unavailability of artesunate, to use artemether in preference to quinine for treatment of severe malaria.\u00a0\r\rUganda adopted this policy for severe malaria treatment, however; parenteral artesunate is not widely available and effort to improve accessibility should be reinforced.\r\rSince 1991 and before April 2019, the only FDA-approved treatment for severe malaria in the U.S. was intravenous quinidine gluconate. Availability of quinidine gluconate in the U.S. has declined over the past 20 years, such that the last lot manufactured reached expiry in March 2019. A replacement essential medicine is needed in the U.S. for treatment of severe malaria. Intravenous (IV) artesunate is now the only option available for treatment in the United States, and is uniquely available through the CDC under an expanded access investigational new drug (IND) protocol via scattered distribution centers located near transportation hubs. Unfortunately, severe malaria can progress rapidly, and delays in delivery of IV artesunate from treatment distribution centers to patients with severe malaria may lead to complications, including treatment failure and death. To mitigate risk of severe malaria complications, pharmacologic treatment for severe malaria treatment should be optimized for patients with severe malaria.\u00a0\r\rMalaria",

To mitigate risk of severe malaria complications, pharmacologic treatment for severe malaria treatment should be optimized for patients with severe malaria.\u00a0\r\rMalaria treatment and Drug Pharmacokinetics\rSevere malaria is a medical emergency which if not immediately treated results in 100% mortality. It is fundamental that plasma concentrations of a highly effective antimalarial drug are achieved as rapidly as possible. Artesunate is a water soluble hemisuccinate artemisinin derivative; available as sodium hemisuccinate salt for injection (Guilin Pharmaceutical Factory, Guangxi, People\u2019s Republic of China). Artesunate\u2019s excellent antimalarial property demonstrated by rapid parasite clearance, is enhanced by its high initial maximum concentration (Cmax) and rapid hydrolysis to its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin. High plasma concentrations of artesunate and dihydroartemisinin are achieved within 5 minutes of drug administration and artesunate is rapidly cleared from circulation. The Cmax for both artesunate and dihydroartemisinin are observed rapidly post dose administration indicating rapid conversion of artesunate to dihydroartemisinin. Artesunate is cleared from circulation rapidly while dihydroartemisinin has a longer elimination half-life. Accurate measurement of plasma concentrations of artesunate and dihydroartemisinin should guide adequate dosing as well as facilitate differentiation of treatment failure due to inadequate drug exposure from failure due to drug resistance.\rRationale\rCurrent dosing regimens for IV artesunate are based on time to parasite clearance and not clinical endpoints related to physiologic changes that occur with parasitemia. Other measures of physiologic dysfunction can be used as study endpoints for a malaria treatment outcome analysis of current regimens for IV artesunate for severe malaria treatment. Improved dosing regimens will lead to fewer complications and likely fewer deaths. Such a strategy is needed to further reduce public health gains against malaria mortality that seem to have recently stalled.\r\rFor pediatric patients, IV artesunate dosing is weight-based to adjust for artesunate clearance and has been developed based on time to parasitemia clearance times, which may not completely reflect clinical cure. The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) 2015 guidelines state that children weighing <20 kg should receive 5 doses of 3.0 mg/kg/dose compared to older children and adults who should receive 2.4 mg/kg/dose, all at times 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours (WHO Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria. Third Edition. www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241549127/en/). The December 2016 CDC guidelines recommended 2.4 mg/kg/dose for all pediatric and adult patients, regardless of weight (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/artesunate/Artesunate_protocol_12_19_2016.pdf), while the recently updated October 2019 CDC guideline recommends the same weight-based dosing scheme as the WHO (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/Malaria_Treatment_Table_120419.pdf). A recent study of severe malaria in sub-Saharan African children documented equivalent time to parasite clearance using 2.4 mg/kg/dose at 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours; and a larger 4.0 mg/kg/dose at 0, 24 and 48 hours.\r\rP. falciparum parasites are known for their capacity to infect red blood cells that then display variant surface antigens that adhere to endothelial vasculature in target organs.",

# Privacy Policy for Ilana Protocol Intelligence

**Effective Date:** December 1, 2025
**Last Updated:** December 1, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Ilana Protocol Intelligence ("we," "our," or "Ilana") provides AI-powered clinical trial protocol analysis and compliance checking through a Microsoft Word add-in. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you use our services.

**By using Ilana Protocol Intelligence, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.**

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Protocol Content
When you use Ilana to analyze protocol text:
- **Selected Text**: Text you select in Microsoft Word for analysis
- **Document Context**: Surrounding context needed for accurate analysis
- **Analysis Results**: Suggestions, compliance issues, and recommendations generated by our AI

**Important**: We do NOT store complete protocol documents. Only the text segments you actively submit for analysis are processed.

### 2.2 Usage Data
We automatically collect:
- **Request Metadata**: Timestamps, analysis types requested, suggestion categories
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, error rates, cache hit rates
- **User Interactions**: Accepts, rejects, and dismissals of suggestions (anonymized)

### 2.3 Technical Data
- **Session Identifiers**: Temporary session IDs for request correlation (not linked to personal identity)
- **Error Logs**: Stack traces and error messages for debugging (scrubbed of sensitive content)

### 2.4 Information We Do NOT Collect
- Personal health information (PHI)
- Personally identifiable information (PII) of trial participants
- Complete protocol documents
- Microsoft account credentials
- Email addresses or contact information (unless you contact support)

## 3. How We Use Your Information

### 3.1 Primary Purposes
- **Protocol Analysis**: Process your text using AI models to identify compliance issues and generate suggestions
- **Service Improvement**: Analyze usage patterns to improve suggestion quality and system performance
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensure regulatory alignment with ICH-GCP E6/E9 guidelines

### 3.2 Feedback-Based Learning
- Anonymized user feedback (accept/reject/dismiss) is used to adjust suggestion confidence scores
- No protocol content is stored in feedback data—only category and action metadata
- Feedback data is aggregated and cannot be traced to specific users or organizations

### 3.3 Caching
- Analysis results are temporarily cached (15 minutes) to improve performance for repeated queries
- Cached data is stored in-memory only and is never persisted to disk
- Cache is automatically purged when the service restarts

## 4. Third-Party Services
